Oppel Jr.\n\nNew York Times\n\n2020-03-24\n\nAs bigots blame them for the coronavirus and President Trump labels it the Chinese virus, many Chinese-Americans say they are terrified of what could come next.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Yuanyuan Zhu was walking to her gym in San Francisco on March 9, thinking the workout could be her last for a while, when she noticed that a man was shouting at her. He was yelling an expletive about China. Then a bus passed, she recalled, and he screamed after it, Run them over.\n\nShe tried to keep her distance, but when the light changed, she was stuck waiting with him at the crosswalk. She could feel him staring at her. And then, suddenly, she felt it his saliva hitting her face and her favorite sweater.\n\nIn shock, Ms. Zhu, who is 26 and moved to the United States from China five years ago, hurried the rest of the way to the gym. She found a corner where no one could see her, and she cried quietly.\n\nThat person didn't look strange or angry or anything, you know she said of her tormentor. He just looked like a normal person.\n\nAs the coronavirus upends American life, Chinese-Americans face a double threat. Not only are they grappling like everyone else with how to avoid the virus itself, they are also contending with growing racism in the form of verbal and physical attacks. Other Asian-Americans -- with families from Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar and other places -- are facing threats, too, lumped together with Chinese-Americans by a bigotry that does not know the difference.\n\nIn interviews over the past week, nearly two dozen Asian-Americans across the country said they were afraid -- to go grocery shopping, to travel alone on subways or buses, to let their children go outside. Many described being yelled at in public -- a sudden spasm of hate that is reminiscent of the kind faced by American Muslims and other Arabs and South Asians after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nBut unlike in 2001, when President George W. Bush urged tolerance of American Muslims, this time President Trump is using language that Asian-Americans say is inciting racist attacks.\n\nMr. Trump and his Republican allies are intent on calling the coronavirus the Chinese virus, rejecting the World Health Organization's guidance against using geographic locations when naming illnesses, since past names have provoked a backlash.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he was calling the virus Chinese to combat a disinformation campaign by Beijing officials saying the American military was the source of the outbreak. He dismissed concerns that his language would lead to any harm.\n\nOn Monday evening, Mr. Trump tweeted, It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States. He added they should not be blamed for the pandemic, though he did not comment on his use of the phrase Chinese virus.\n\nIf they keep using these terms, the kids are going to pick it up, said Tony Du, an epidemiologist in Howard County, Md., who fears for his son, Larry. They are going to call my 8-year-old son a Chinese virus. It's serious.\n\nMr. Du said he posted on Facebook that this is the darkest day in my 20-plus years of life in the United States, referring to Mr. Trump's doubling down on use of the term.\n\nWhile no firm numbers exist yet, Asian-American advocacy groups and researchers say there has been a surge of verbal and physical assaults reported in newspapers and to tip lines.\n\nSan Francisco State University found a 50 percent rise in the number of news articles related to the coronavirus and anti-Asian discrimination between Feb. 9 and March 7. The lead researcher, Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian-American studies, said the figures represented just the tip of the iceberg iceberg because only the most egregious cases would be likely to be reported by the media.\nProfessor Jeung has helped set up a website in six Asian languages to gather firsthand accounts; some 150 cases have been reported on the site since it was started last\nThursday.\nBenny Luo, founder and chief executive of NextShark, a website focused on Asian-American news, said the site used to get a few tips a day. Now it is dozens.\nWe've never received this many news tips about racism against Asians, he said. It's crazy. My staff is pulling double duty just to keep up. He said he was hiring two\nmore people to help.\nNo one is immune to being targeted. Dr. Edward Chew, the head of the emergency department at a large Manhattan hospital, is on the front lines of fighting the\ncoronavirus. He said that over the past few weeks, he had noticed people trying to cover their nose and mouth with their shirts when they are near him.\nDr. Chew has been using his free time to buy protective gear, like goggles and face shields, for his staff in case his hospital runs out. On Wednesday night at a Home\nDepot, with his cart filled with face shields, masks and Tyvek suits, he said he was harassed by three men in their 20s, who then followed him into the parking lot.\nI heard of other Asians being assaulted over this, but when you are actually ridiculed yourself, you really feel it, he said the following day.\nA writer for The New Yorker, Jiayang Fan, said she was taking out her trash last week when a man walking by began cursing at her for being Chinese.\nI've never felt like this in my 27 yrs in this country, she wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. I've never felt afraid to leave my home to take out the trash bc of my face.\nAttacks have also gotten physical.\nIn the San Fernando Valley in California\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
