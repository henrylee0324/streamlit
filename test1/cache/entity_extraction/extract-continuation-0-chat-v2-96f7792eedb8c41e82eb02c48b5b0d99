They lived through the horrors of 9/11 and witnessed the discrimination against Muslims in the wake of those attacks. With the coronavirus pandemic today, they\nare hearing the all-too-familiar vitriol toward Asian Americans being spewed from the dark and angry corners of social media and beyond.\nAlthough they remained stoic and largely reserved in the decades that followed internment, their quiet resilience changed dramatically after 9/11. They would begin to speak\nout against the injustices of that time, becoming activists in their own right.\nNow, as a Chicagoan who for nearly two decades worked for the Chicago Department of Public Health, I can't remain silent as I witness the bigotry that has percolated in\nChicago and across the country in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic that began in Wuhan, China. Racism has its own virulence that is bad for the nation's soul and,\nas research has shown, is actually bad for the nation's health.\nMy family's path to the Midwest began in those internment camps. In order to leave, family members secured employment in Chicago. Despite prejudice and fear among many\nChicago businesses and their employees, my grandparents and parents were given opportunities at Wrap-on Tools and Edgewater Beach Hotel. My grandparents became\nvaluable, dependable and loyal employees and challenged their children to excel too.\nGiven a chance, my parents thrived, both finishing high school and going on to college. My dad joined the Army and then went to dental school on the GI Bill. My mom became\na high school art teacher. They were resilient and didn't dwell on the past, raising their children with strong values, including sacrifice and service to others. My parents'\ninfluence is a key reason I chose my career path in public health and now work at a foundation that advocates for a fair and just opportunity for everyone in America.\nBut my parents were spurred to action after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. As fear, discrimination and violence toward Muslims increased, they spoke out against these injustices. In\nrecent years, they raised their voices again as federal policies became more punitive and restrictive for immigrants and refugees. Normally soft-spoken and unassuming, my\nparents shared their experiences in panel discussions, newsletters and as featured guests of a multimedia exhibit depicting the internment of Japanese Americans, \"Then They\nCame for Me.\"\nThe resilience I learned from them has buoyed me and my three brothers, as we too have experienced racism, including crude and hateful remarks. My parents taught us to\nturn the other cheek, to be confident in our identity and values, no matter the situation.\nNow, I must speak out in the face of new attacks on Asian Americans. A preliminary analysis, in fact, examined nearly 1 million tweets focused on racial minorities between\nNovember 2019 and March 2020 -- the period when the novel coronavirus went from outbreak to pandemic. The percentage of tweets involving negative speech against Asian\nAmericans increased 70% during that period while falling 4% for all other racial minority groups. (The research team was comprised of a group of doctors, including Gilbert Gee\nfrom UCLA along with Thu Nguyen of UCSF, Shanise Criss of Furman University, Quyen Nguyen of the University of Maryland and David Chae of Tulane.)\nThis treatment of Asian Americans is immoral, but also dangerous to public health. Research shows that hateful speech and other actions against racial and ethnic minorities --\neven seemingly small slights -- might make people sick, contributing to heart disease, respiratory illness and other chronic diseases. In an environment where people of any\nrace feel threatened, they might be less likely to seek treatment out of fear and distrust of our medical system. This is especially dangerous in the midst of a pandemic when we\nshould be lowering barriers to care, not raising them.\nDuring and after this pandemic, we must treat Asian Americans not as enemies, but as fellow victims of this insidious virus that does not distinguish by place, race, age or\ngender. This is the time to support our neighbors, not turn on them. These are the values that define our nation.\nJohn of the Cross, a 16th century Catholic priest and mystic, wrote that \"In the evening of our lives we will be judged only by how we have loved.\" As a nation, we will be\njudged now by how we treat people in need. That's a lesson I learned from my parents, and a value I carry proudly in my work and everyday life.\nIn this time of the novel coronavirus, we are all in need of understanding, compassion and love. This is good for the soul, and for the health of our nation.\n----------\nJulie Morita, M.D., is executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in Princeton, New Jersey.
