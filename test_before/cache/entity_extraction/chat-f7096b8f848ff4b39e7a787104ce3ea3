She yelled, ‘We have a stupid government letting stupid\nMuslims like you into our country.’\nShe was aggressive and intimidating.\nThe second time was at the Royal Sydney Easter Show when I picked up an egg in the barn, not knowing this\nwas something I was not allowed to do, and a man nearby began screaming at me. He was annoyed about\nthe egg but made his argument about my religion, background and about people not understanding where\nthey belong.\nBoth times I held my ground and defended my right to be in Australia but these experiences are infuriating.\nYes, of course it’s their country but it’s my country, too. What’s more, I love this country by choice.\nOver the years I’ve discovered that the people who think it’s okay to make hurtful comments are not\nnecessarily who you think they might be. Most of the racism I’ve experienced over the last 14 years has come\nfrom those with different cultural backgrounds and other recent arrivals to this country.\nBy contrast, the majority of ‘typical’ Australians have been very friendly and accepting and I’ve made some\nlovely friends. When the Lindt Cafe situation unfolded in 2014, people went out of their way to ensure I was\nokay and that I remained safe. I think two major incidents and a handful of comments in 14 years isn’t\nunreasonable.\nThe biggest problem with racism in our country is that the poison often trickles from the top down. It seems\nas though if anyone wants to be successful in politics in Australia, they have to start spouting hate speech\nabout other cultures. These are our leaders and our role models, and if we’re learning how to treat our fellow\nAustralians from them, we’re going to be in big trouble moving forward.” “Born to a proud Wadjanbarra Yidinji\nand Jirrbal mother and an African- American father, I often refer to myself as ‘double black’. It took me years\nto claim that identity because so much of my childhood was spent figuring out who I was.\nWhen we moved to the States, I was told I couldn’t identify as black because I had ‘lighter skin and good\nhair’. To them, I was mixed. When we moved back to Australia, when I was 10, it was just as strange. I didn’t\ngrow up on country and didn’t look like my extended family. As a kid I didn’t feel Aboriginal enough and I\ngrew up confused about what being black even meant.\nI was 11 when I first heard the words ‘You’re too pretty to be Aboriginal’, and that’s the moment I realised\nbeing Aboriginal was considered dirty, like no good can come of it. Over the years, there have been others:\n‘You’re not like the rest’, ‘You’re too articulate’ and ‘You could pass yourself off as Brazilian – that’s much\nbetter.’\nThere is this view that I should be happy by my proximity to whiteness, as though assimilation is something\nI’m trying desperately to achieve, but people don’t realise comments like that perpetuate genocide on my\nculture. In efforts to explore my Aboriginality and beauty I created the documentary Too Pretty to Be\nAboriginal, which screened in 2019 on NITV Our Stories.\nWhen there’s hate bubbling up around you, there’s also a level of internal racism you experience. I was raised\nwith messages like, ‘You’re black so you have to work twice as hard.’ And, ‘Don’t behave in a way that can be\ndeemed as too urban or show too much attitude lest you’re labelled aggressive.’ You learn to present yourself\nin a way that’s socially acceptable for the masses but it’s at the cost of your identity.\nWhen I started my magazine, Ascension, I wanted it to be a one-stop shop for women of colour but since the\nBlack Lives Matter protests began, I’ve noticed a significant shift in the demographic of my readership.\nFor the first time ever, people from all backgrounds are coming to us, eager to embrace diversity. And while\none part of me feels like shouting, ‘Yes! This is the opportunity we’ve been waiting for’, another part can’t\nhelp wondering if we’re just a trend. Is it Black Lives Matter today and then something else tomorrow? I’m\nopting to remain positive.\nNot to take away support from America – I’m an African-American woman; my people need it – but\nAustralia needs to acknowledge its own black history first and stop sweeping it under the carpet. It’s\nhypocritical to say “black lives matter” but then deny ours.\nI don’t believe the government will ever come to the table to rectify the atrocities against my people.\nI truly believe that if Australians can channel the compassion and love of humanity displayed during the\nbushfires and extend it to First Nations people, we could start a revolution.\nThe solution starts with us.” • If you experience racial discrimination you can lodge a complaint with the\nAustralian Human Rights Commission at humanrights.gov.au/complaints.\nCREDIT: Dilvin Yasa\nCopyright (c) 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited. www.smh.com.au.
