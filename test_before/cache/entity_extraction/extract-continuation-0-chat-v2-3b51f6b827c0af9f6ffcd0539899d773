It’s a background noise growing louder, as President Donald Trump and many Republicans have tried to drown out critiques of their own bad decisions by refocusing blame on China and Chineseness.\nThis has had immediate, terrifying consequences for Asian Americans who could be perceived to be Chinese, and it’s a narrative that we will struggle to resist on our own. Though reactions to this scapegoating show how divorced Asian Americans have become from the solidarity we need — and why belief in our own exceptionalism was a trap.\n-\nOver the past two weeks, many Republicans pivoted to insist on the term “Chinese virus” at every opportunity. It was just the latest chapter in the Trump administration’s standoff with the Chinese government — an oppressive regime that does deserve criticism for its handling of the outbreak, whose officials have falsely suggested that the new coronavirus came from the United States.\nThe changes that the coronavirus has wrought are so overwhelming, a photo of people standing close to each other already feels like a missive from another planet. So it’s easy to understand how this latest flare of bigotry could be seen in a vacuum: new era, new kind of racism.\n19th century propaganda\nThe only historical reference points that the media seem to use are those that involve Asians — Japanese internment, or late 19th century propaganda about “yellow peril.” I’ve even seen some of my fellow Asian Americans try to redirect the hatred, complaining that they’re being targeted despite not being Chinese, or that it’s stupid to be racist because South Korea and Taiwan have done such a good job at containing the virus.\nThis is a blinkered narrative. What is horrifying about coronavirus racism is not that it is new, or that it hits the “wrong” Asians. It is that what’s being targeted at Asian Americans — what the Trump administration has mindlessly enabled — is part of the ongoing story of American bigotry.\nAsian Americans have sometimes struggled to understand our place within the wider landscape of race, bamboozled by the “model minority” myth pushed by white politicians. As the historian Ellen Wu has written, the idea that Chinese Americans in particular were high-achieving and compliant was exploited first to bolster an alliance with China during World War II, then spun to discredit the black civil rights movement.\n(A movement from which, ironically, all Asian Americans greatly benefited.) The model minority term is one of American white supremacy’s most successful campaigns, simultaneously driving a wedge between Asian Americans and other people of colour and alienating us from our own right to dissent. What did we have to complain about, anyway?\nThen there’s the term Asian American itself, a civil rights-inspired creation of the 1960s that has never managed to contain all the identities it was supposed to hold. A fourth-generation Chinese American shares little family history with a first-generation Cambodian immigrant — and the knowledge that many non-Asians don’t know or care about the difference can feel like an insult.\n'Chinese virus'\nWe are an ethnically diffuse, low-voting group, wildly divided in economic class and too concentrated on the coasts to have any real impact on national elections. We are not, and have never been, a powerful united front. That’s part of why it’s so easy for Trump to call it the “Chinese virus,” wounding us all: Electorally, it won’t even hurt him.\nThat is, unless we use this moment to double down on solidarity. Asian Americans have often been accused, accurately, of not showing up for other people of colour. We have shied away from taking responsibility for our complicity in systems of power. (Although some Asian Americans have also been fiercely progressive advocates for racial and economic justice, even beyond our own little corner.)\nAs many writers and thinkers of colour have pointed out, it feels almost unbearably lopsided that white Americans can be so mediocre at ally-ship, while the rest of us flagellate each other and ourselves for not caring enough, not doing enough. The temptation to opt out altogether is strong. This might feel especially true, as we struggle with a kind of solidarity that feels completely unintuitive: physical retreat.\nThat’s why it’s so important to keep reminding ourselves that coronavirus racism is far from unique. It’s the same kind of hate that erupted after 9/11, aimed at Muslims and South Asians; it’s the hate that black Americans have been enduring for centuries. Asian Americans’ fixation on Asian-specific racism elides the bigger story.\nIn November — about a month and a half before doctors in Wuhan first identified the virus — the FBI released a report from 2018 showing that hate crimes involving physical assault were at a 16-year high. Vandalism was down; violence was up. Black Americans, as usual, bore the brunt of most hate crimes.\nScapegoating works\nNotably, there was also a significant upswing in violence against Latinos, on the heels of Trump’s brutal rhetoric over undocumented immigrants and his obsession with the border. Experts stressed that the hate crime count was an imperfect record, since reporting and standards vary so much across the country. Nonetheless, the message seemed clear: Scapegoating works, and it works fast.\nNow it’s Asian Americans’ turn. According to a representative from the organisation Chinese for Affirmative Action, there were at least 300 news stories published around the country between the end of February and beginning of March about attacks against Asian Americans.\nSince then, a woman attacked a Korean college student in Manhattan, allegedly yanking her by the hair and punching her in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country experiencing a crisis due to the novel coronavirus, leading to rising infection rates and economic downturns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is the country where the novel coronavirus outbreak originated, and it has been blamed for the pandemic by some political figures in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States who has been criticized for his handling of the coronavirus crisis and for using the term \"Chinese virus.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are a demographic group in the U.S. facing increased racism and discrimination during the coronavirus pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action is an organization that advocates for the rights of Chinese Americans and has reported on the rise of attacks against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is the novel coronavirus pandemic that has led to widespread health and economic crises in the United States and around the world.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric has contributed to the rise of anti-Asian racism during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>COVID-19<|>The United States is currently facing a crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to high infection rates and economic challenges<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>COVID-19<|>COVID-19 originated in China, leading to international scrutiny and blame directed at the Chinese government<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action is an organization that represents and advocates for the rights of Asian Americans, particularly in the context of rising racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>COVID-19<|>Asian Americans have faced increased discrimination and violence during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
