The minute-long video is titled Fight the Virus. Fight the\nBias - the message they declare at its end.\nThe video, produced by the Advertising Council, a nonprofit organization that makes public service\nannouncements, and Emmy Award-winning writer Alan Yang, is aimed at building a sense of humanity and\nbreaking the silence around the hatred impacting the Asian-American community.\n\"Amid this pandemic and the stresses associated, nobody should have to also endure the added layer of fear\nthat comes from this surge in racial violence and harassment,\" said Advertising Council President and CEO Lisa\nSherman. She said she hoped the video would inspire US citizens to rethink their biases and help end the wave\nof racism facing Asian Americans. Reports by many civil rights organizations show that Asian communities across the US are enduring increasing\nharassment and assaults since the novel coronavirus began to spread in the country.\nThe Anti-Defamation League recently compiled a list of coronavirus-related anti-Asian incidents from January to\nJune, including people being physically assaulted, properties being vandalized, and an online meeting disrupted\nby anti-Asian slurs in the chat function.\nStop AAPI Hate, a coronavirus-related racism-reporting platform, recorded more than 2,000 incidents across the\ncountry in three months.\nStatements by US President Donald Trump and his allies referring to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus\" or the\n\"kung flu\" have fueled xenophobia and bigotry toward people of Chinese descent and other Asian Americans,\nsaid Russell Jeung, chair and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University.\n\"President Trump's insistent use of the term 'Chinese virus' creates an implicit association that the virus is\nChinese, and that the Chinese have the virus,\" Jeung said.\nPolitical scapegoat\nSubsequently, others have blamed Chinese and Asians in the US for being the source of the disease, said Jeung,\nwho compiled the Stop AAPI Hate data. He noted that when Trump began using the terms, incidents of bias\nagainst Asian Americans jumped.\n\"It's clear that President Trump is scapegoating China for the pandemic. He does so to deflect responsibility for\nhis poor handling of this public health crisis, and more recently to avoid dealing with 'Black Lives Matter' and\nAmerica's racial injustices,\" said Jeung. \"By blaming China, he seeks to create an outside enemy that his\npolitical base could be angry with.\"\nA survey by the Pew Research Center showed that 4 in 10 US adults said that it had become more common for\npeople to express racist views toward Asians since the pandemic began.\nAbout a quarter of the Asian-American respondents said they feared someone might threaten or physically\nattack them, a higher percentage than for any other group.\nThe Trump administration has been criticized for doing little about the rise in anti-Asian hate amid the pandemic,\nin comparison with actions taken by previous administrations in similar situations such as the SARS outbreak\nand the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, then president George W. Bush, a Republican, and the attorney general and FBI director\nimmediately issued statements that hate crimes and discrimination against Arab, Muslim, Sikh and South Asian\nAmericans would not be tolerated.\nliazhu@chinadailyusa.com\nCredit: LIA ZHU in San Francisco\nCopyright China Daily Jul 23, 2020\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
