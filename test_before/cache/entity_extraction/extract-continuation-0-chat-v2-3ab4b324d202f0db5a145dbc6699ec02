The main prisoner rights organization in Italy, Antigone, estimated this could benefit at most 3,000 prisoners, while the penitentiary system is at around 14,000 over capacity. The organization called for broader measures to ensure the release of a greater number of detainees, including in particular older detainees and those with at-risk health profiles, among other measures. Civil society organizations have also called for alternatives to detention for all people currently detained in immigration detention centers in Italy due to the increased risk of infection and no prospect for deportation.\nRecommendations:\nGovernment agencies with authority over people housed in prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers should consider reducing their populations through appropriate supervised or early release of low-risk category of detainees including for example, those whose scheduled release may be soon, those who are in pre-trial detention for non-violent and lesser offenses, or whose continued detention is similarly unnecessary or not justified. Detained individuals at high risk of suffering serious effects from the virus, such as older people and people with underlying health conditions, should also be considered for similar release with regard to whether the detention facility has the capacity to protect their health, including guaranteed access to treatment, and taking into consideration factors such as the gravity of the crime committed and time served.\nIf safe and legal deportations are suspended due to the virus, the legal justification for detaining people pending deportation may no longer exist. In these cases, authorities should release detainees and institute alternatives to detention.\nAuthorities that operate prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers should publicly disclose their plans of action to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection in their facilities and the steps they will take to contain the infection and protect prisoners, prison staff, and visitors, if cases of the virus or exposure to it are present. Persons in any form of detention have the same right to health as the non-incarcerated population and are entitled to the same standards of prevention and treatment. The detained population and the general population have a compelling interest to know in advance what plans authorities have put in place for handling COVID-19.\nAuthorities should take steps to ensure they are appropriately coordinating with public health departments and communicating openly with staff and people in custody. They should also screen and test for COVID-19 according to the most recent recommendations of health authorities. They should provide appropriate hygiene training and supplies and ensure that all areas susceptible to harboring the virus and accessible to prisoners, prison staff, and visitors, are disinfected regularly, consistent with accepted best practices. They should develop plans for housing people exposed to or infected with the virus. They should ensure that individuals released or put on supervised leave have access to appropriate accommodations and health care. Any plans for lockdowns or isolation should be limited in scope and duration based on the best science available, and they should not be or seem punitive, as fear of being placed in lockdowns or isolation could delay people notifying medical staff if they experience symptoms of infection. Detention centers should consider alternative strategies such as video conferencing for individuals to be able to connect with family or legal counsel.\nGovernments seeking to contain the spread of the virus should evaluate and modify as necessary during the time of the outbreak measures used to enforce immigration laws, including court hearings and check-ins with authorities as alternatives to detention. Authorities should provide public notice\nthat there will be no negative repercussions for missed court dates or check-ins during the time of the outbreak. Authorities should stop arbitrary detentions of migrants, seek alternatives to detention for people currently in immigration detention, and opt for release where possible, particularly for those in high-risk categories if infected and for people who are being held with no prospect for imminent, safe, and legal deportation.\nIn the absence of adequate state support, the United Nations and other inter-governmental agencies should urgently press for access to formal and informal detention facilities to provide detainees with life-saving assistance.\nGovernments housing refugees and asylum seekers should ensure their response to COVID-19 includes prevention and treatment measures, with particular attention to measures to alleviate overcrowding in detention centers and camps, improve sanitation and access to health care, and resort to time-bound quarantines and isolation only as necessary.\nEnsure protection of health workers\nAs part of the right to health, the ICESCR provides that governments should create conditions that would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness.\nGovernments have an obligation to minimize the risk of occupational accidents and diseases including by ensuring workers have health information and adequate protective clothing and equipment. This means providing health workers and others involved in the COVID-19 response with appropriate training in infection control and with appropriate protective gear.\nCombating the spread of COVID-19 requires that health facilities have adequate water, sanitation, hygiene, healthcare waste management, and cleaning. A 2019 baseline report by WHO and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) found that [a]n estimated 896 million people use health care facilities with no water service and 1.5 billion use facilities with no sanitation service.\nHuman Rights Watch research into hospital-acquired infections in Hungary suggests the nation's mismanaged, underfunded, and understaffed public healthcare system is poorly equipped to handle a COVID-19 outbreak. Patients and medical experts described a lack of basic hygiene protocol, lack of isolation rooms, and a shortage of health professionals, doctors and nurses, and medical supplies in general. One doctor said it was nearly impossible to get essential items like disinfectant and respirator masks, which are critical to protect against viruses.\nIn Venezuela, Human Rights Watch has documented a health system in utter collapse. Hospitals have closed or are operating at a fraction of their capacity, many without regular access to electricity or water. Vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and diphtheria have returned long before the pandemic hit.\nBroad sanctions imposed by the US on Iran have drastically constrained the ability of the country to finance humanitarian imports, including medicines. This has caused\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ANTIGONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Antigone is the main prisoner rights organization in Italy, advocating for the rights and welfare of prisoners.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALY<|>GEO<|>Italy is a country in Southern Europe, where the prisoner rights organization Antigone operates and where the penitentiary system is currently over capacity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has significantly impacted health systems and detention facilities, leading to calls for the release of vulnerable detainees.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Human Rights Watch is an international organization that conducts research and advocacy on human rights issues, including the health system in Hungary and Venezuela.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUNGARY<|>GEO<|>Hungary is a country in Central Europe, where the public healthcare system has been reported to be poorly equipped to handle a COVID-19 outbreak.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VENEZUELA<|>GEO<|>Venezuela is a country in South America, facing a health system collapse exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNICEF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UNICEF is a United Nations agency that provides humanitarian and developmental aid to children worldwide, including health care facilities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTIGONE<|>ITALY<|>Antigone operates within Italy, advocating for prisoner rights in the context of the country's overcapacity penitentiary system<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>ANTIGONE<|>Antigone has called for measures to protect prisoners during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>HUNGARY<|>Human Rights Watch has conducted research on the healthcare system in Hungary, highlighting its inadequacies during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>VENEZUELA<|>Human Rights Watch has documented the collapse of the health system in Venezuela, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNICEF<|>WHO<|>UNICEF collaborates with WHO to improve health care facilities and services, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>WHO<|>WHO is responsible for coordinating global health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>VENEZUELA<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted Venezuela's already collapsing health system<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>HUNGARY<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the inadequacies of Hungary's healthcare system<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
