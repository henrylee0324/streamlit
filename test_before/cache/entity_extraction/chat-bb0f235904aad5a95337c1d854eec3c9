Racial discrimination against Asian Americans is becoming more common, pointed\nout a survey report from American think tank Pew Research Center.\n31 percent of Asian Americans said they have been subject to racist slurs or jokes since the pandemic began, while 26\npercent said they’ve feared someone might physically attack them, the survey found.\nAs the number of racist attacks against Asian Americans in various areas of New York has increased significantly, the New\nYork City Police Department has even established an Asian Hate Crime Task Force recently, the first task force in the U.S. that\nis aimed at Asian hate crimes.\nAcross the country, Asian American health-care workers have reported a rise in bigoted incidents, according to an article\npublished on The Washington Post.\nThe racial hostility has left Asian Americans, who represent 6 percent of the U.S. population but 18 percent of the country’s\nphysicians and 10 percent of its nurse practitioners, in a painful position on the front lines of the response to the coronavirus\npandemic, the article said.\n“Some COVID-19 patients refuse to be treated by them. And when doctors and nurses leave the hospital, they face increasing\nharassment in their daily lives, too,” it continued.\nWhat lies at the root of such pernicious consequences is certain U.S. politicians’ misdeed of spreading “political virus”.\nSome U.S. officials have taken every opportunity and played every trick they can to attack and stigmatize China, including\ncalling the COVID-19 “Chinese virus” and “Wuhan virus”, which has fostered extremism and racism in the U.S. and become\nthe main culprit of the dramatically increasing attacks and threats targeting Asian Americans.\nThe attacks and smear campaign launched against China by some American politicians have ignited anti-Asian sentiment,\naccording to an article published by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).\n“Yet public figures and politicians play a key role in promoting racial equality and non-discrimination principles. In this\nregards, it is dismaying to witness State officials adopting alternative named for the COVID-19 coronavirus,” said Tendayi\nAchiume, the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and\nrelated intolerance.\n“Indeed, instead of using the internationally recognized name of the virus, these (U.S.) officials have adopted names with\ngeographic references, typically referring to its emergence in China. This sort of calculated use of a geographic-based name\nfor this virus is rooted in and fosters racism and xenophobia,” she pointed out in a recent statement.\nSystemic racism is a malady afflicting the American society.\nColor has obviously played a major role in determining the fate of many Americans, U.S. scholar Thomas Sowell wrote in his\nbook Ethnic America: A History.\nIn history, the notorious Chinese Exclusion Act and crimes against Asian Americans such as sending a large number of Asians\nto concentration camps during the World War II have startled the world.\nAsian Americans now still suffer continuous harassment, exclusion and structural discrimination in the U.S., arousing great\nconcern among the international community and American people with breadth of vision.\nThis year, the special procedures of the U.N. Human Rights Council have repeatedly condemned the U.S. for its racial\ndiscrimination and hate speech.\nRecent hate crimes and violent assaults against people of Asian descent should sound an alarm for America, said nearly 200\nAmerican foreign policy scholars and former diplomats in a joint statement issued on USA Today.\nThey called upon U.S. leaders at every level and in every sector to take action against anti-Asian racism and express support\nfor Asian diaspora and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities.\nOnly those who lack competence themselves would deliberately invent divisions and confrontations against others.\nThe conflicts and antagonisms in the American society won’t stop worsening unless certain U.S. officials break off the political\nscheme to pass the buck to China for their misconduct in dealing with the epidemic.\nOtherwise, other groups of people, in addition to Asian Americans, may end up a new victim of some U.S. officials.\nIn the U.S., a country that claims to be a “beacon of freedom”, some U.S. politicians, however, have ignored the international\nhuman rights law, openly incited and condoned racial discrimination, and violated the bottom line of human civilization by\nblatantly trampling on human rights, which is by no means tolerable.\n(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People’s Daily to express its views on foreign policy.)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
