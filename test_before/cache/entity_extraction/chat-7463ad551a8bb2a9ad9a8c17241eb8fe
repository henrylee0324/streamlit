Her husband, Liang Rivers, is from China.\nLiang, who has cooked the same Szechuan menu for a decade, says he doesn't pay the president's word choices much mind. He's more worried, he said,\nabout the people who come in without masks and the fact they're doing half their normal business.\nHistorian Ellen Wu, who studies the Asian experience in America, worries public information campaigns promoting the Asian community will be undermined\nby \"all this messaging right from the top - the really dispiriting messages about the 'China virus.' \"\n\"The people in power, their words carry a lot of weight,\" said the assistant professor at Indiana University in Bloomington.\nEven an offhand comment can unintentionally stoke fears of racism. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) sowed panic last week in Vietnamese salon circles\nwhen he said the state's first community transmission of the coronavirus occurred through a nail business.\n\"We're not Chinese, but we're still Asians, right?\" said Tracy Tran, who used to employ more than 50 people at several salons in Southern California. \"It will\naffect us,\" she said.\n'Every day is a new day'\nIn New York City, people in Chinatown are trying to help each other. A volunteer effort of about 20 Asian American professionals has raised more than\n$100,000 to buy meals for front-line workers from Chinatown restaurants starved for orders, while the nonprofit Chinatown Partnership worked with local\nlawmakers last month to kick off a campaign called Show Some Love in Chinatown. Children are helping parents: One son built Asian-Veggies.com for his\nfather, who started taking produce orders through WeChat and a glut of text messages.\nSome see an opportunity for the Asian diaspora in the United States to marshal strength in a new way. Shirley Tang, who teaches Asian American studies at\nthe University of Massachusetts at Boston, said collaboration across generations and cultures can help mobilize Asian Americans to produce not only stronger\nbusinesses but stronger communities.\n\"In order to survive and thrive, they need to know how to not just build their own business but find a way to enliven their whole block,\" Tang said.\nChau's restaurant, Aux Epices, is a testament to the resilience of those immigrant communities on the brink - the culmination of years of passion and\nhardship overcome on the way to financial security in America. She's pushed her 10-table business through the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, natural\ndisasters and a landlord who hiked her rent.\nHer restaurant's future, though, has never been more uncertain.\n\"Every day is a new day,\" she said.\nChau started what would become Aux Epices in 1993 after emigrating from Malaysia and struggling to survive on a waitress's paychecks, begging start-up\nmoney from family and driving a hard bargain on the lease.\nThe naive plan, she said, was to support her painting career, the ambitions that brought her to New York City in 1986. Then the restaurant took over. She\nfiddled with the menu, hung the walls with art and joined a \"sandwich renaissance,\" offering fancy rolls instead of Wonder Bread.\nChau thinks it's \"crazy\" to reopen now even for takeout, with business still dismal and the pandemic raging. But last week, she did it anyway. It felt like the\nright thing to do, she said, when governors everywhere were pushing for a restart and when friends who also love Chinatown were trying so hard.\n\"My heart wanted to come back,\" Chau said.\nA table at her entrance blocks people from coming too close in her narrow space, and she wears the face masks her staff had earlier abandoned as they\nheard about attacks on Asians with covered faces. She waits for orders, though some days there are zero. Chau says she's given up on a government loan -\nshe has no borrowing history, and by the time she figured out the paperwork, her bank was swamped with demand, she said.\nShe walks with an Asian friend who remains uncomfortable going out alone.\nShe listens all day to the news and wishes the president would spend more time talking about increased testing, the kind that might help her staff feel safe.\n\"I was like, this is not the time to blame,\" she said. \"This is time to work together. In restaurants, you're always in the action mode. You don't have a passive\nmode.\"\n\"And this is a pandemic!\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
