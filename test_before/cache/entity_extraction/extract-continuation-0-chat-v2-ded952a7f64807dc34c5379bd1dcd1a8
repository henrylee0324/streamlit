being blamed for COVID-19, three women on the\nreceiving end of racial abuse share their experiences with Dilvin Yasa.\nIt’s the land of mateship and fair go, but Australian academics have been documenting some disturbing factors\nwhere minority groups are concerned.\nAccording to the University of Western Sydney’s Challenging Racism Project, one in three people experienced\nracism in the workplace in 2015-16, while a 2013 study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence found\nseven in 10 students experienced or observed racism during their childhood.\nProfessor Tim Soutphommasane, Australia’s race discrimination commissioner from 2013 to 2018 and the author\nof On Hate, says that while we’re seeing a global anti-racism moment, with people across the world talking and\nthinking about racism with a new level of seriousness, racism is on the rise on home ground. “Bodies such as\nthe Australian Human Rights Commission and some state anti-discrimination bodies have received a higher\nnumber of complaints about racial discrimination,” he explains. “There has been a spike in racial hostility\ndirected at people from Asian backgrounds in particular.”\nThis isn’t a matter of “hurt feelings”, or that people who are targets of racial taunts are delicate or sensitive, Soutphommasane adds.\n“There’s a large amount of research that shows the psychological, even physiological, effects of racism on\npeople’s wellbeing; it can diminish a person and sap them of their dignity.\nPeople who aren’t from minority backgrounds don’t always understand the damage it can cause.” Lee Lin Chin\nwas the first person I idolised, because of everything she represented. With her media career, quirky wardrobe\nand short hair, not only was she the antithesis of the ‘typical’ Asian mould of that ladylike woman with the long,\nglossy hair, but she was visible to mainstream Australia at a time when minority groups were invisible on screen.\n“When you’re Asian, there are all these expectations you’ll be good with numbers or work in medicin. But I was\npassionate about drama and the arts. Square peg, round hole.\nI grew up in an environment where it wasn’t unusual to have people scream ‘Go back to your own country’ as\nyou’re going about your business.\nThat’s sad in itself but one of the things that’s been concerning me lately is the fetishisation of Asian women.\nI’ve been stalked on trains by masturbating men and once I was followed home by a guy who kept asking, ‘Are\nyou an accountant? Do you work in finance?’ It happens in the workplace, too; earlier in my career, I remember\none of my company directors picking me up and swinging me around as he told me how much he loves Asian\nwomen. It’s a strange fixation that’s rooted in male dominance and white supremacy.\nThe COVID-19 era has brought to light an overt form of racism I haven’t experienced for a long time. Recently I\nwas standing in line at Aldi with my four-year-old son and, even though I was following social-distancing\nguidelines, the woman in front turned around and spat, ‘Maintain social distancing because you are Asian.’\nI told her that I was born here and that I didn’t personally cause the virus, but it fell on deaf ears. I understand\nit’s a time of fear for everyone but that incident has really shaken me. I’ve been anxious about going out in\npublic and I ask myself, ‘Do people see me, or do they see “generic Asian spreading disease”?’ It’s a terrible way\nto live.\nI don’t think Australia is more racist than other countries but I think we believe we’re a lot more tolerant than\nwe really are. This is a country filled with citizens who think nothing of saying, ‘Oh, you speak really good\nEnglish’ to someone with a broad Aussie accent. And ‘I don’t normally like Asians but you’re pretty nice’, and\nthen laughing it off as some kind of joke. As a stand-up comedian [Ngo is a member of the Tight 5 Comedy\ngroup], I can tell you with some experience that ‘casual racism’ is no laughing matter.”\n“MOST OF THE RACISM I’VE EXPERIENCED HAS COME FROM OTHER RECENT ARRIVALS“ Maie Sufan, a “40-\nsomething” engineer and support relations co-ordinator for Islamic Relief Australia, moved to Australia from her\nnative Syria in 2006.\n“When I moved to Australia for love, I left behind a very successful life as an engineer and lecturer. It was hard\nto leave my country but even though I wasn’t sure about how different things would be culturally in Australia, I\nwasn’t too worried. I knew it to be a multicultural nation and Australians have a reputation overseas for being\nfriendly and inclusive. I felt welcomed as soon as I landed.\nWhen you wear a headscarf you get used to people openly staring, but while I’ve had my share of ‘f...ing Muslim’\ncomments in the streets, I’ve only ever had two major incidents where the behaviour has been extreme.\nThe first time was not long after I arrived, when a woman in her 50s followed me around a shopping centre\nscreaming in my face about why I was in ‘her country’. She yelled, ‘We have a stupid government letting stupid\nMuslims like you into our country.’\nShe was aggressive and intimidating.\nThe second time was at the Royal Sydney Easter Show when I picked up an egg in the barn, not knowing this\nwas something I was not allowed to do, and a man nearby began screaming at me. He was annoyed about\nthe egg but made\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DILVIN YASA<|>PERSON<|>Dilvin Yasa is a journalist who shares experiences of racial abuse faced by women in Australia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN SYDNEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Western Sydney conducts research on racism through its Challenging Racism Project.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIM SOUTPHOMMASANE<|>PERSON<|>Tim Soutphommasane is the former race discrimination commissioner of Australia and author of On Hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Australian Human Rights Commission addresses complaints about racial discrimination in Australia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISLAMIC RELIEF AUSTRALIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Islamic Relief Australia is an organization that provides support and aid, with Maie Sufan serving as a co-ordinator.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAIE SUFAN<|>PERSON<|>Maie Sufan is an engineer and support relations co-ordinator for Islamic Relief Australia, originally from Syria.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has exacerbated racial tensions and discrimination, particularly against Asian communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Australia is a multicultural nation where issues of racism and discrimination are prevalent, as discussed in the text.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DILVIN YASA<|>TIM SOUTPHOMMASANE<|>Dilvin Yasa discusses the experiences of racial abuse, which Tim Soutphommasane addresses as a former race discrimination commissioner<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN SYDNEY<|>TIM SOUTPHOMMASANE<|>Tim Soutphommasane's work is related to the research conducted by the University of Western Sydney on racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTRALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION<|>TIM SOUTPHOMMASANE<|>Tim Soutphommasane served as the race discrimination commissioner, overseeing complaints to the Australian Human Rights Commission<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAIE SUFAN<|>ISLAMIC RELIEF AUSTRALIA<|>Maie Sufan works as a support relations co-ordinator for Islamic Relief Australia<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>AUSTRALIA<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and intensified issues of racism in Australia<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DILVIN YASA<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Dilvin Yasa's article discusses the experiences of racism in the context of Australian society<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAIE SUFAN<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Maie Sufan's experiences of racism are situated within her life in Australia<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
