[expletive] people did it again? Go back to your country\" as she walked from Manhattan to Queens.\nSabharwal, who emigrated from India in 1982, said the children yelled at her when she still had the white powder and fine glass on her face from the remains of the collapsed World Trade Center that day. Working at the time as an employee at Fiduciary Trust Company International, she lost nearly 100 colleagues after the south tower came down.\n\"Today, it's the Chinese. Tomorrow, it's the Indian,\" said Sabharwal, who survived the attacks because she had not yet reached her office on the 96th floor. \"It needs to stop now.\"\nGoing back even further in history, Glen Cove resident Bob Machida, 75, grew up learning about internment camps from his family members.\nDuring World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order to intern 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry in 10 camps after the Pearl Harbor attack on Dec. 7, 1941.\nBefore Machida was born, his aunt and uncle on the West Coast were sent to an internment camp in Utah, while his mother and father on the East Coast were tracked by an FBI agent.\n\"In a climate that's divisive like this, you could run into situations where some extremists may take advantage of a situation and say things they shouldn't,\" Machida said. \"We're one country, one multiracial country. And we're all in this together.\"\nFarrah Mozawalla, executive director of Nassau County's Office of Asian American Affairs, said people can report discriminatory incidents in New York by calling the Attorney General's Civil Rights Bureau at 800-771-7755 or the Nassau County Human Rights Commission at 516-571-3662.
