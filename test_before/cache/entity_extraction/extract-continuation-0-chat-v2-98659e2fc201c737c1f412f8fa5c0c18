VOA independently collected data\nfor two of the cities.\nAsian American rights advocates attribute the unprecedented string of attacks to former U.S. President Donald\nTrump's rhetoric blaming China for the deadly coronavirus and, more broadly, the scapegoating of Asian\nAmericans by ordinary people frustrated or angered by the economic and social impact of the pandemic.\nI think the political leadership under Trump really put a target on the backs of people perceived to be Chinese.\nIt's Sinophobia, said Chris Kwok, a board member for the Asian American Bar Association of New York.\nFour other American cities also reported triple-digit percentage increases in anti-Asian hate crimes: Philadelphia\nand Cleveland each reported six incidents, up from two in 2019; San Jose had 10, up from 4, while Los Angeles reported 15, up from seven.\nWhile most cities experienced overall hate crime declines, including attacks against groups that had recently\nspiked like Jews, attacks against Asians rose materially in most cities, and only declined in one - Washington,\nD.C., said Brian Levin, executive director of the hate and extremism research center.\nThe FBI defines a hate crime as a criminal offense motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation and other\nfactors. Examples include assault and vandalism. Each November, the FBI publishes its annual hate crime data for\nthe previous year. That means the data released by a handful of police agencies provides the only early window\ninto the number of hate crimes last year.\nThough based on a relatively small sampling of data, the figures strongly suggest that 2020 will be the worst\nyear this century for anti-Asian hate crime, Levin said.\nThe reported spike in anti-Asian hate crimes is in line with data tracked by Asian American advocacy\norganizations.\nStop AAPI Hate, a hate tracker created last year by several Asian American groups, has recorded more than\n2,800 incidents of racism and discrimination targeting Asian Americans between March and December 2020.\nWhile verbal harassment and shunning made up more than 90% of the incidents, physical assaults accounted for\nnearly 9%.\nMany of the victims are non-Chinese Asians who apparently were mistaken for having hailed from China.\nEast Asians who look Chinese are now experiencing this, and this goes back to a long history of anti-Asian\ndiscrimination in this country, Kwok said of the United States.\nIn a troubling report released last month, Stop AAPI Hate said 126 of the incidents involved Asian Americans over\nthe age of 60. A number of incidents took place in the San Francisco Bay area last month, including one involving\na 91-year-old Asian man violently pushed to the ground by a stranger.These violent assaults have a devastating impact on our community as they are part of an alarming rise in anti-\nAsian American hate during the COVID-19 pandemic, co-founders of STOP AAPI Hate said in a February 9statement.\nIn the latest incident, Salman Muflihi, 23, was arrested last week for allegedly stabbing a 36-year-old Asian man\non a street in New York City's Chinatown. Muflihi was charged over the weekend with one count of attempted\nmurder in addition to other charges, but not a hate crime. If authorities were to file a hate crime, it could result\nin a longer prison sentence.\nKwok said there is a level of frustration in the Asian American community over prosecutors' refusals to file hate\ncrime charges.\nI think they need to really reassess how they approach it, particularly in this era that we're in, which I think of it\nas an emergency area, particularly for Asian Americans as they experience discrimination, he said.\nIn a statement, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said additional charges may be forthcoming.\nMeanwhile, overall hate crimes last year declined by an average of 7% in the 15 cities tracked by the center for\nthe study of hate and extremism. In New York City, for example, police investigated 265 hate crimes, down from\n428 the previous year.\nOf the five cities that reported increases, two are in California, including San Jose, which saw an increase of\n162%. - VOA\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are individuals of Asian descent living in the United States, who have been targets of hate crimes, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former U.S. President whose rhetoric has been attributed to the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>California State University is an educational institution that compiled data on hate crimes for the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism is a research center that analyzes hate crime statistics and trends in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an advocacy organization that tracks incidents of racism and discrimination against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is a major U.S. city where incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes have occurred, including a stabbing incident in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA<|>GEO<|>The San Francisco Bay Area is a region in California where several incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes have been reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in New York City known for its significant Asian American population and where a stabbing incident occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRIAN LEVIN<|>PERSON<|>Brian Levin is the executive director of the hate and extremism research center, providing insights on hate crime trends.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALMAN MUFLIHI<|>PERSON<|>Salman Muflihi is a 23-year-old individual arrested for allegedly stabbing an Asian man in New York City.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has been linked to an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Trump's rhetoric has been linked to the increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>California State University compiled data for the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Stop AAPI Hate tracks incidents of racism and discrimination targeting Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>CHINATOWN<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in New York City where anti-Asian hate crimes have occurred<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRIAN LEVIN<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>Brian Levin is the executive director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALMAN MUFLIHI<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>Salman Muflihi was arrested in New York City for allegedly stabbing an Asian man<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The San Francisco Bay Area has reported incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
