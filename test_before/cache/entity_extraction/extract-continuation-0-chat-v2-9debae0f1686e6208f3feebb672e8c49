He had briefly lost his senses of taste and smell.\nThe friend, who USA TODAY is not naming because he declined to be interviewed, had been golfing in Arizona, where there were a handful of confirmed cases.\nHe knew the loss of those senses was a symptom. But his doctor prescribed him a steroid and assured him it\nwas just his asthma acting up.\nBy the time Dungill's friend hugged him goodbye, saying he'd see him at his sister's celebration the next day,\nwhatever bug that seemed to have been bothering him was gone except for a mild case of the sniffles.\n***\nLess than two weeks later, at around 7 a.m. on March 11, Dungill sat in the emergency room waiting area of\nthe Advocate Christ Medical Center.\nSix others were also there seeking medical attention.\nDungill's illness had started about a week after his sister's celebration. He had been at his office when, while\nreaching for a sweater, he realized he was freezing, while his eyes and forehead were burning.\"Hey, if a miracle happens, I'll be at work tomorrow,\" Dungill announced to his boss after toggling on his out-\nof-office email message. \"Otherwise, I'm out sick.\"He made it back to his office after a couple of days off, but his fever persisted. His co-workers commented on\nhow terrible he looked.\nWhen it hurt to breathe, Dungill relented and had his wife drop him off at the emergency room.\nThe admitting medical personnel appeared unconcerned that his symptoms were related to the novel\ncoronavirus. Though they gave Dungill a mask, none of the nurses or doctors wore any personal protective\nequipment themselves.\nThey told Dungill they couldn't check for novel coronavirus. At the time, the CDC was only advising tests in\ncases that fit narrow parameters, such as if the person had traveled to mainland China.\nHowever, because the doctors were concerned about blood clotting, they had Dungill undergo a CT scan.\nThe doctor who brought the results to Dungill's hospital bed donned a jarring get-up, now including a face\nmask and goggles.\nThe doctor explained that medical officials in China had reported that X-rayed images of the lungs of those\ninfected with the novel coronavirus often displayed damage that looked like a starry night or a cobweb.\nDungill's scans showed the same patterns.\nDungill blurted out a number: 845. It was the room in the same hospital where his dad was also laid up.\nCookie Dungill was dealing with his own persistent symptoms that doctors struggled to decipher. He had\ninitially shown up to the hospital due to constipation causing stomach-clenching discomfort, but he had been\nsent home, diagnosed with a bad case of gas.\nAfter the pain got even worse, he called an ambulance to take him back to the hospital. Even though one of\nthe symptoms of COVID-19 was abdominal pain, the hospital had apparently ruled it out without a test. They\nhad him share a room with a fellow patient.\nSevil said he urged his doctor to run the same CT scans on his father, and they came back with the similar\ntelltale pattern. It kicked off chaos in Advocate Christ.\nNurses and doctors who had treated both Dungill men without protection were sent home. According to a\nlater medical report, Cookie's \"12 attending nurses were also tested and were positive for COVID-19 and\nquarantined.\"\nA spokesperson for Advocate Christ said they couldn't comment directly on this case, but that their staff\n\"consistently followed CDC guidance, which evolved as public health experts learned more about the virus\nand its transmission,\" and that they required masks within the hospital starting March 31.\nThe doctors ultimately kept Cookie hospitalized but sent Sevil to the waiting area so his wife could pick him\nup and take him home.\nIt was 11:44 p.m., about 17 hours after Sevil had first arrived at the hospital. The room was now crowded\nwith patients with symptoms just like his: red eyes and dry coughs and painful-sounding wheezes.\nEverybody had been given masks.\nSevil again took a tally. He stopped counting at 80.\n***\nThe scientist Benhur Lee spent the first few months of 2020 trying to get people to fathom the severity of\nthe virus already coursing through the country.\nIn mid-February, Lee bought Lysol spray, disinfecting wipes, and – even though the CDC was discouraging\nthem – medical face masks.\nLee found it reprehensible that the agency was advising Americans against wearing masks and claiming\nthat they were ineffective when scientists had long considered them a weapon against infection. So Lee\ncarried with him a bag of masks and handed them out to strangers on the streets and subways of New\nYork City.\nHe persuaded the doormen of his building to erect a plexiglass barrier between their desks and the lobby.\nHe tried to convince colleagues – who were all scientists – that they were underestimating the virus. He\njoined a few dozen scientists who wrote a letter to New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio urging him to close\nschools.\nLee's public health tweets got him branded as an alarmist. His inbox filled with threats or anti-Asian slurs,\nspurring Lee to take a hiatus from Twitter.\nAnd then, in the second week of March – the same week that the World Health Organization declared the\nvirus to be a pandemic – reality seemed to finally, if only partially, set in for the United States.\nIn a span of two days, the National Basketball Association suspended its season. Tom Hanks announced\nthat he had\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DUNGILL<|>PERSON<|>Dungill is a person who experienced symptoms related to the novel coronavirus and sought medical attention at Advocate Christ Medical Center.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Advocate Christ Medical Center is a hospital where Dungill and his father received treatment for their symptoms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKIE DUNGILL<|>PERSON<|>Cookie Dungill is Dungill's father who was hospitalized with symptoms that were later associated with COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVIL<|>PERSON<|>Sevil is Dungill's wife who took him home after his visit to the hospital.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENHUR LEE<|>PERSON<|>Benhur Lee is a scientist who advocated for the use of masks and public health measures during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is where Benhur Lee distributed masks and advocated for public health measures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization is an international public health agency that declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Basketball Association is a professional basketball league that suspended its season in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOM HANKS<|>PERSON<|>Tom Hanks is a celebrity who announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19 during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that caused a global pandemic starting in early 2020, leading to widespread health and safety measures.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNGILL<|>ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER<|>Dungill sought medical attention at Advocate Christ Medical Center for symptoms related to COVID-19<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COOKIE DUNGILL<|>ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER<|>Cookie Dungill was hospitalized at Advocate Christ Medical Center with symptoms related to COVID-19<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEVIL<|>DUNGILL<|>Sevil is Dungill's wife who took him home after his hospital visit<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENHUR LEE<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>Benhur Lee distributed masks and advocated for public health measures in New York City<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>COVID-19<|>The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, highlighting its global impact<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION<|>COVID-19<|>The National Basketball Association suspended its season in response to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOM HANKS<|>COVID-19<|>Tom Hanks announced he tested positive for COVID-19, bringing attention to the pandemic<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
