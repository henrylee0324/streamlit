There's been a spike of crime during COVID, but it hadn't really reached this area.\nI moved here because it was safe here.\"\nShi Quan Lin, 28, has lived in the neighborhood 20 years. He can count on his thumbs the number of times he\nhas walked by a crime scene.\n\"We don't really have murders here,\" he said. \"Because of COVID, no one is really on the street so they see an\nopportunity. Usually at that hour, there are tons of people walking around.\"\nThe hour he referenced was the moment Friday night when the do-gooder, Yong Zheng, was stabbed to death\nwith a screwdriver during a wild caught-on-camera melee. Cops said Zheng was returning from dinner with\nfriends when they saw two groups of men fighting outside an illegal gambling den, and intervened.\nMourners filled the intersection where Zheng, 46, staggered across the street and finally collapsed, filling the\navenue with candles and white flowers. Crying family members kneeled beside a barricade that closed off traffic\nand held pictures of a smiling man they called father, son and hero.\nJessica Gao, 38, a restaurant worker who has lived in Sunset Park for 15 years, said she didn't know Zheng, but\njoined the crowd to pay her respects.\n\"He's a Chinese hero,\" Gao said. \"He tried to help the Chinese people, and the other people killed him. Now the\ncommunity is not safe at all. Our kids grow up here. It's not safe for our kids.\"\nCops arrested William Smith, 45, of Brownsville, on Sunday and charged him with murder, robbery and assault.\nCops tracked him down after a witness took a picture of his license plate and gave it to police, sources said.\nLocal residents spoke of the rise in attacks in the city against Asian Americans, but police have not classified the\nincident as a hate crime. The community agrees Zheng's death was a tragedy. Of that there is no dispute.\n\"Mr. Yong Zheng is a typical good Samaritan,\" said Yu Lin, a City Council candidate. \"He is someone that can\nrepresent every single one of us. A good father, a good son, a good friend to have. This happened to him. That\nmeans it could happen to every one of us.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUNSET PARK<|>GEO<|>Sunset Park is a neighborhood in Brooklyn known for its reputation for safety before the recent spike in crime during COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVENTH AVE<|>GEO<|>Seventh Ave. is a street in Sunset Park where a tragic incident occurred involving a Good Samaritan.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YONG ZHENG<|>PERSON<|>Yong Zheng was a 46-year-old man who was killed while trying to intervene in a fight outside a gambling den, remembered as a Good Samaritan.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILLIAM SMITH<|>PERSON<|>William Smith is a 45-year-old man from Brownsville who was arrested and charged with the murder of Yong Zheng.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA GAO<|>PERSON<|>Jessica Gao is a 38-year-old restaurant worker who has lived in Sunset Park for 15 years and attended the memorial for Yong Zheng.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRIS BITTMANN<|>PERSON<|>Chris Bittmann is a 20-year-old resident of Sunset Park who expressed surprise at the recent violence in the neighborhood.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHI QUAN LIN<|>PERSON<|>Shi Quan Lin is a 28-year-old resident of Sunset Park who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years and commented on the rarity of murders there.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YU LIN<|>PERSON<|>Yu Lin is a City Council candidate who spoke about Yong Zheng's character and the implications of his death for the community.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YONG ZHENG<|>SUNSET PARK<|>Yong Zheng was killed in Sunset Park while trying to help others, marking a tragic event in the neighborhood<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILLIAM SMITH<|>YONG ZHENG<|>William Smith is charged with the murder of Yong Zheng, directly linking him to the incident<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA GAO<|>YONG ZHENG<|>Jessica Gao attended the memorial for Yong Zheng, showing community support and mourning for his death<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRIS BITTMANN<|>SUNSET PARK<|>Chris Bittmann expressed his feelings about the safety of Sunset Park, highlighting the impact of recent events<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHI QUAN LIN<|>SUNSET PARK<|>Shi Quan Lin commented on the rarity of crime in Sunset Park, reflecting on the community's previous safety<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YU LIN<|>YONG ZHENG<|>Yu Lin spoke about Yong Zheng's character and the significance of his death for the community<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
