Then came the video of George Floyd's death at the hands of\npolice.\nWithin a week, anxiety and depression among African Americans shot to higher rates than experienced by any other racial or ethnic group, with 41 percent screening positive\nfor at least one of those symptoms, data from the Census Bureau shows.\nThe findings - from a survey launched by the federal government originally intended to study the effects of the novel coronavirus - indicate that the recent unrest,\ndemonstrations and debate have exacted a disproportionate emotional and mental toll on black and Asian Americans, even as rates of anxiety and depression remain relatively\nflat among white Americans and decreased among Latin Americans.\nThe rate of black Americans showing clinically significant signs of anxiety or depressive disorders jumped from 36 percent to 41 percent in the week after the video of Floyd's\ndeath became public. That represents roughly 1.4 million more people.\nAmong Asian Americans, those symptoms increased from 28 percent to 34 percent, a change that represents an increase of about 800,000 people.\nThe data comes from an emergency weekly survey of U.S. households launched by the Census Bureau at the end of April to measure the pandemic's effects on finances,\nhousing, education and health. In the most recent data release, more than 1 million households were contacted through email and text, and more than 100,000 responded,\ncreating a robust sample size for the findings. Analysis of the data was conducted by multiple federal agencies including the Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.\nIncluded in the 20-minute survey - called the Household Pulse Survey - were questions from two screening tools used by doctors to help determine whether patients might have\nmajor depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. The results provide a real-time window into the country's collective mental health.\nData collected in 2019, released two weeks ago by the CDC, allows for the most accurate comparison to date of America's mental health from before the pandemic to after.\nAnd that comparison is stark: Rates of depression and anxiety symptoms have more than tripled since the coronavirus hit.\nBut the increases have hit black Americans especially hard.\n\"When we think about the impact of covid-19 among black Americans and other underserved populations - they have had to remain in the workforce or they have felt the effect\nof unemployment,\" said Erlanger Turner, a licensed psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University. \"When you add the police killings from the last\ncouple of weeks, it makes sense that you would see additional stress among the black community.\"\nThe census survey collects data over a six-day period weekly, from Thursday to the following Tuesday. The video of George Floyd's death began circulating widely online May 26,\nthe last day of data collection for Week 4. The following week, May 28 to June 2, mass protests spread across the country.\nIn the wake of such incidents - as images keep replaying and debates ignite throughout the country - \"it can feel like it's happening to you over and over,\" said Wizdom Powell,\ndirector of the University of Connecticut's Health Disparities Institute. \"You start seeing symptoms of hyper vigilance, emotional numbing and secondary trauma.\"\nA 2018 study in the journal Lancet found that following police shootings, African Americans suffer higher levels of psychological distress than white people even when they live\nin the same community.\n\"It's hard for others outside of the community to understand the level to which we feel each others' pain. With the George Floyd killing and other killings, we don't have a\npersonal connection to those individuals. But it could have been us or someone we know, and that does lead to additional stress and anxiety around these incidents,\" said\nTurner, author of \"Mental Health Among African Americans.\"\nOne surprising finding in the new census data was that Asian Americans experienced the largest one-week change in anxiety and depression symptoms of any racial or ethnic\ngroup. Asians had the lowest rates of depression in 2019 - just 3 percent screened positive - but that rate has soared during the pandemic.\nFor months, since the emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, Asian Americans have experienced marked racism.\n\"Given how this pandemic started, with discrimination against Asian Americans, it's not hard to imagine that as the national conversation started turning back to race and racial\nviolence, you see anxiety and depression start resurfacing,\" Powell said.\nAsian Americans have seen a rise in hate crimes and harassment, their businesses have been targeted by vandals and looters, and Asian doctors and nurses have been abused\nand physically attacked even as they help the United States fight the coronavirus.\n\"In my private practice, I've seen a huge uptick,\" said Michi Fu, a psychologist in Los Angeles with expertise in working with Asian American families. \"What worries me about\nthis increase in trauma and stress are all those who aren't seeking help because Asian Americans are especially less likely to do that when it comes to mental health. Compared\nto other ethnic groups, the stigma is just incredibly strong.\"\nLatin Americans began the pandemic with higher rates of symptoms than all other groups, but those symptoms decreased during the past week. Experts say this may be a\nreflection of some measure of relief that after three years of intense focus on immigration and their community during the Trump administration, the attention is turning toward\nother groups.\n\"I remember when 9/11 happened, there was such a focus on Middle Eastern communities, and there were a lot of ethno-cultural communities that were relieved that the focus\nwas no longer on them,\" said Miguel Gallardo, a psychology professor at Pepperdine University and director of Aliento, the school's center for Latino communities. \"Now, we're\ntalking about Black Lives Matter, and for some\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>PERSON<|>George Floyd was an African American man whose death at the hands of police sparked nationwide protests and discussions about racial injustice and mental health impacts on the black community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENSUS BUREAU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Census Bureau is a federal agency that conducts surveys to collect data on various aspects of American life, including mental health during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEPPERDINE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pepperdine University is an educational institution where experts like Erlanger Turner and Miguel Gallardo work, focusing on psychology and mental health issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSEHOLD PULSE SURVEY<|>EVENT<|>The Household Pulse Survey is a federal survey launched to measure the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on American households, including mental health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has significantly impacted mental health across various racial and ethnic groups in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>African Americans are a racial group that has experienced heightened levels of anxiety and depression, particularly following the death of George Floyd.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are a racial group that has faced increased anxiety and depression during the pandemic, exacerbated by racism and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LATIN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Latin Americans are a racial group that began the pandemic with high rates of mental health symptoms, which have since decreased.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is the city in China where the coronavirus pandemic originated, leading to significant global health and social impacts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>AFRICAN AMERICANS<|>George Floyd's death has had a profound impact on the mental health of African Americans, leading to increased anxiety and depression<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENSUS BUREAU<|>HOUSEHOLD PULSE SURVEY<|>The Census Bureau conducts the Household Pulse Survey to gather data on the effects of the pandemic, including mental health<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOUSEHOLD PULSE SURVEY<|>COVID-19<|>The Household Pulse Survey was launched in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its impact on American households<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICANS<|>COVID-19<|>COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the mental health of African Americans, leading to increased symptoms of anxiety and depression<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>COVID-19<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased anxiety and depression among Asian Americans, partly due to racism and discrimination<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LATIN AMERICANS<|>COVID-19<|>COVID-19 has affected the mental health of Latin Americans, with symptoms decreasing recently<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ERLANGER TURNER<|>PEPPERDINE UNIVERSITY<|>Erlanger Turner is a licensed psychologist and assistant professor at Pepperdine University, providing insights on mental health issues<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIGUEL GALLARDO<|>PEPPERDINE UNIVERSITY<|>Miguel Gallardo is a psychology professor at Pepperdine University, focusing on mental health in Latino communities<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
