Critics of the police have questioned whether officers, chafed by the summer’s unrest and the national debate over law enforcement, began responding more slowly to calls. But some experts say much of the department’s low clearance rate is tied to difficulties caused by the pandemic — officers cannot interact as widely with the public, and most people, including criminals, are wearing masks. “It’s convenient that everyone is wearing masks now,” said Christopher Herrmann, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. “Obviously that adds to the anonymity aspect of being a criminal.” But, he added, the factors of the pandemic and the backlash against the department — budget cuts, shorter staffing and sick colleagues — had probably hurt officers’ morale. “Cops are kind of tiptoeing around. They’re not as proactive, they’re not as aggressive,” Herrmann said. “They’re not doing their job as well as they normally do.” The number of hate crimes reported to the police also decreased sharply, with complaints down about 40% in 2020 after several years of steady increases. Much of the decline can be attributed to a 47% drop in reported anti-Semitic incidents. But despite the decline, officials contended with a rise in incidents against Asian Americans that they said were linked to the pandemic. The department began tracking coronavirus-related hate crimes this year, covering incidents in which a person was targeted because of bias connected to the virus. So far, the authorities have tracked 25 virus-related crimes this year, a large number of them involving victims of Asian descent. (The department has also recorded 21 incidents as “anti-other” incidents, some of which they say may involve virus-related anti-Asian crimes.) In August, the Police Department created an anti-Asian hate crime task force to address the increase in attacks.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTOPHER HERRMANN<|>PERSON<|>Christopher Herrmann is a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, who commented on the impact of the pandemic on police work and crime rates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN JAY COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>John Jay College of Criminal Justice is an institution in Manhattan where Christopher Herrmann teaches and conducts research related to law enforcement and criminal justice.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Police Department is responsible for law enforcement and public safety, facing challenges such as budget cuts and a rise in hate crimes during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are a demographic group that has faced a rise in hate crimes linked to the pandemic, prompting the creation of a task force by the Police Department.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTI-ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Anti-Asian Hate Crime Task Force was created by the Police Department to address the increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The pandemic refers to the global outbreak of COVID-19, which has affected law enforcement practices and contributed to changes in crime rates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HATE CRIMES<|>EVENT<|>Hate crimes are criminal acts motivated by bias against a particular group, which saw a decline overall but an increase in incidents against Asian Americans during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTOPHER HERRMANN<|>JOHN JAY COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE<|>Christopher Herrmann is a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, where he teaches about criminal justice issues.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ANTI-ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>The Police Department created the Anti-Asian Hate Crime Task Force to combat the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>PANDEMIC<|>The Police Department's operations and effectiveness have been impacted by the pandemic, affecting their response to crime.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HATE CRIMES<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Hate crimes against Asian Americans have increased during the pandemic, leading to specific tracking and response measures.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANDEMIC<|>HATE CRIMES<|>The pandemic has influenced the rates and types of hate crimes reported, particularly against Asian Americans.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
