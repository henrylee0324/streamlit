Adolescents are impressionable, and it’s hard to correct that and convey we should use appropriate language.”\nBased on the racial profiling of Muslims after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 — including a Sikh Indian being misidentified as an Arab Muslim and shot outside the gas station he owned in Mesa, Ariz. — Asian-American scholars saw this wave coming as soon as news of the virus spreading started in January, Ho of CU-Boulder said.\n“The only question is how bad is it going to get?” she said\nHistorically, the majority of society believes the actions are an aberration, and while terrible, there’s nothing they can do, Ho said. A minority of the population view profiling as intolerable and unacceptable, she said.\n“The trick is as an educator, how do we get the small minority to be the majority,” she said. “I want people to step up and say, ‘This is not OK.’” “When you hear people say racist things, tell them you think what they just said is racist and they shouldn’t say it because it harms people,” Ho said. Educating children on human rights and hate crimes is paramount, Aki said.\nThe Golden Rule can go a long way, she said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COLORADO COLLEGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Colorado College is an educational institution that has been providing support to its students, particularly during times of crisis, such as the recent incidents affecting Asian students.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITAKER<|>PERSON<|>Whitaker is a representative from Colorado College who has been addressing the concerns of Chinese students and their families during recent events.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DENVER<|>GEO<|>Denver is a city in Colorado where Mandarin-speaking psychologists were contacted to support students at Colorado College.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CU-BOULDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CU-Boulder is an educational institution where Asian-American scholars are analyzing the impact of racial profiling and societal reactions to crises.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HO<|>PERSON<|>Ho is a scholar from CU-Boulder who has commented on the societal reactions to the racial profiling of Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MESA<|>GEO<|>Mesa is a city in Arizona where a Sikh Indian was misidentified and shot, highlighting issues of racial profiling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AKI<|>PERSON<|>Aki is an educator who emphasizes the importance of teaching children about human rights and hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>9/11<|>EVENT<|>The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, which led to increased racial profiling of Muslims and other communities in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHITAKER<|>COLORADO COLLEGE<|>Whitaker is a representative of Colorado College, addressing the needs of students during recent crises<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DENVER<|>COLORADO COLLEGE<|>Denver is the city where Colorado College sought help from Mandarin-speaking psychologists<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HO<|>CU-BOULDER<|>Ho is a scholar at CU-Boulder discussing the societal implications of racial profiling<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MESA<|>9/11<|>The incident in Mesa is a consequence of the racial profiling that intensified after the 9/11 attacks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AKI<|>COLORADO COLLEGE<|>Aki is an educator advocating for human rights education, which is relevant to the mission of Colorado College<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHITAKER<|>HO<|>Whitaker and Ho are both addressing the impact of societal behavior on students and communities<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
