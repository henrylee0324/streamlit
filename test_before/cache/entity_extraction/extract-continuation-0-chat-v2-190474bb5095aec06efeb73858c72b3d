After the pandemic, Chinatown will be the last place that people choose to return to.\"\nBusiness closures mean lost jobs, sometimes for an entire family, and it is not uncommon for different generations of Chinese American families in Manhattan's Chinatown to run enterprises such as restaurants.\nEarly last month, CNN reported that about 147,000 Asian workers in New York state had filed for unemployment benefit in the past four weeks, a 6,900 percent rise over the same period last year. The number of such filings by white workers rose by 1,840 percent and among black workers by 1,260 percent.\nChen, from Immigrant Social Services Inc, said: \"I know people who have started rationing food among three generations of a family. Waiting for unemployment benefit - which takes months to apply for - and not knowing when they will get their jobs back, they are trying to make their food reserves last a bit longer.\n\"You don't really hear these stories, because they're not being told. People are also largely unaware of those who are being excluded from most federal, state and local funding resources.\"\nSome 1,200 meals a week are now being provided by UA3, supported by Trader Joe's and other sources. In addition to caring for seniors, the NGO provides a home for the deaf in New York and another building for the visually impaired.\nChi Loek, a UA3 board member, said: \"We are pushing to expand our services. Food insecurity is going to be with us not just for months, but for years, and will be compounded by other factors, such as housing. What we are doing right now is intended not as an emergency measure, but as a sustainable, long-term solution to a problem that might grow.\"\nWith this in mind, UA3 last week moved its food pantry to Grand Street in Lower Manhattan, where it is expected to reach out to more people in need. The Chung Pak residents continue to be served.\nKathleen Tom-Lew, a third-generation Chinese born and raised in Chinatown, has been working as a volunteer at the Chung Pak pantry since March, and makes deliveries in the heart of Chinatown.\n\"Originally, we only wanted to serve the elderly, but then other tenants who were out of a job asked to be put on our list,\" said Tom-Lew, a co-founder of the New York nonprofit Chinatown Community Young Lions.\nHong and Loek from UA3 scouted Chinatown and other areas of New York to find restaurants serving Chinese food that met the NGO's standards.\n\"These restaurants are funded by the city to provide ready-made meals for our program. While the seniors have something that is friendly on the stomach, the money is being funneled to local Chinese businesses,\" he said.\nChen, reflecting on the situation in Chinatown since January, said: \"Citywide, we've never been considered a top priority when it comes to a time like this. Usually, there are other neighborhoods that are much worse-off than ours, but this is different. It's unprecedented.\"\nThe lives of local Chinese Americans, including active participants in community work, have been lost during the pandemic, including that of Jean Lau Chin, an avid collector of oral histories in Chinatown.\nJust two people from the Chung Pak complex - a 97-year-old woman and a 105-year-old man - have died since the outbreak, but neither from COVID-19.\nAccording to an article in The New York Times in the middle of last month, one-third of all coronavirus deaths in the US had been reported among nursing home residents and workers.\nWu, the superintendent, said: \"Since early March, we have provided masks to everyone entering the building, including caregivers and volunteers. If anyone leaves the building and then re-enters, we give them a new mask. We also give them protective eyewear and thoroughly spray and disinfect everyone.\"\nReferring to the seniors, who have been told not to go outside, he said, \"We've gone out of our way to meet their needs and will continue to do so.\" Tom-Lew, who has been joined by her entire family in volunteering to help the elderly in Chinatown, spoke of the heart-warming response she has received.\n\"Officially, we are supposed to limit our contact only to those we are delivering to, for obvious reasons. But people wanted to thank us for our kindness by giving us something in return, such as a water bottle. One lady, who is in her 70s and ethnically Chinese, even gave me packs of gum,\" she said.\n\"When the pandemic was raging in late March and early April, tenants would open the door slightly, allowing us to pass through the food bags. However, we often put the bags outside on the floor, knocked on the door and then walked away.\n\"Before we left the floor, we could hear the squeaky sound of a door opening, followed by a shout down the hallway of 'thank you'.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in Manhattan known for its Chinese American community and businesses, which have been significantly affected by the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a state in the United States where Chinatown is located and where many Asian workers have filed for unemployment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UA3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UA3 is a nonprofit organization providing meals and support services to the community, including a home for the deaf and visually impaired in New York.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRADER JOE'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Trader Joe's is a grocery store chain that supports UA3 by providing resources for meal distribution.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHUNG PAK<|>GEO<|>Chung Pak is a complex in Chinatown that serves as a community hub for elderly residents and those in need of food assistance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATHLEEN TOM-LEW<|>PERSON<|>Kathleen Tom-Lew is a third-generation Chinese American volunteer at the Chung Pak pantry, co-founder of the Chinatown Community Young Lions, and actively involved in community service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEAN LAU CHIN<|>PERSON<|>Jean Lau Chin was a community member and avid collector of oral histories in Chinatown who passed away during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has significantly impacted communities, including the Chinese American community in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATHLEEN TOM-LEW<|>CHUNG PAK<|>Kathleen Tom-Lew volunteers at the Chung Pak pantry, providing food assistance to the community<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UA3<|>CHUNG PAK<|>UA3 provides meals and support services to residents of the Chung Pak complex<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRADER JOE'S<|>UA3<|>Trader Joe's supports UA3 by providing resources for meal distribution<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>NEW YORK<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood within New York that has been affected by the pandemic and economic downturn<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATHLEEN TOM-LEW<|>JEAN LAU CHIN<|>Kathleen Tom-Lew reflects on the loss of community members like Jean Lau Chin during the pandemic<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>CHINATOWN<|>COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the Chinatown community, leading to business closures and job losses<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHUNG PAK<|>KATHLEEN TOM-LEW<|>Chung Pak serves as a community hub where Kathleen Tom-Lew volunteers to help those in need<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
