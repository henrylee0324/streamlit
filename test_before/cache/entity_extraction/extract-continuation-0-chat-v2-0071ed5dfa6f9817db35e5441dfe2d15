\"It's not right and we're not going to tolerate it.\"\nConstable Visintin could not say how many suspects in these recent hate-crime cases have had charges recommended against them or provide more complete data on how many hate crimes were reported in the city last year and against which groups.\nPolice across the country don't typically release up-todate statistics on hate crimes, so it is unclear whether other police departments are seeing a similar uptick in attacks against East Asian people amid the global pandemic that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\nHate-crime data across the country are collected from police each year by Statistics Canada, but it can take up to two years before this information is released to the public. Toronto has seen no notable increase in hate crimes over the past month and a half, Toronto Police Service spokeswoman Meaghan Gray said.\n\"However, we also know that hate-related occurrences often go unreported to police so I'm not sure our numbers would accurately reflect the possible lived experiences for some members of the community,\" Ms. Gray said in an e-mailed statement.\nIn 2018, the latest data available from Statistics Canada, there were 56 hate crimes reported to police that targeted East Asian or Southeast Asian people, out of a total of 780 hate crimes motivated by race or ethnicity.\nJohn Paul Catungal, assistant professor at UBC's Institute for Gender, Race, Sexuality and Social Justice, said he is not surprised by Vancouver's reported spike in attacks against East Asian people as this sentiment has become a global phenomenon because of the coronavirus.\nIn the United States, where President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for calling COVID-19 the \"China virus,\" the FBI recently warned local police forces that hate crimes against Americans with Asian backgrounds will likely surge, according to ABC News, which obtained an internal report.\nOn Wednesday, Vancouver police released surveillance footage from the convenience store that shows a fiftysomething white man yelling at the senior East Asian man who suffers from dementia.\n\"I can't get into specifics, but they were racially motivated slurs and comments and they had to do with COVID-19 and they were anti-Asian comments,\" Constable Visintin said at a news conference.\nThe suspect, who was wearing a black T-shirt with the logo of a Canadian charity that supports injured motorcycle riders, then grabs the man and forcefully walks him out the door, giving him a final push that sends the senior toppling backward onto the sidewalk where he hits his head. The suspect, who was wearing gold rings, a gold bracelet and a gold chain, then walks outside and picks the victim up and sits him down on the pavement beside a slipper that had fallen off.\nThe suspect then calmly walks back into the store to pay for his goods.\n\"This could have been a lot worse, we're so thankful that this man who suffers from severe dementia is okay,\" Constable Visintin said. \"He is at home, he's with his family and he is uninjured.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VANCOUVER POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Vancouver Police Department is responsible for law enforcement in Vancouver, including addressing hate crimes and public safety issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TANIA VISINTIN<|>PERSON<|>Constable Tania Visintin is a spokeswoman for the Vancouver Police Department, providing information on hate crimes and public safety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to increased hate crimes against East Asian people, particularly in Vancouver.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST ASIAN PEOPLE<|>GEO<|>East Asian people are a demographic group that has been targeted in recent hate crimes in Vancouver amid the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is the city in China where the COVID-19 pandemic originated, contributing to anti-Asian sentiment globally.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN PAUL CATUNGAL<|>PERSON<|>John Paul Catungal is an assistant professor at UBC's Institute for Gender, Race, Sexuality and Social Justice, commenting on the rise of hate crimes against East Asian people.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TORONTO POLICE SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Toronto Police Service is responsible for law enforcement in Toronto, which has not reported a notable increase in hate crimes recently.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATISTICS CANADA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Statistics Canada is the national statistical office that collects and reports data on hate crimes across the country.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TANIA VISINTIN<|>VANCOUVER POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>Tania Visintin serves as a spokeswoman for the Vancouver Police Department, providing updates on hate crimes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EAST ASIAN PEOPLE<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spike in hate crimes against East Asian people in Vancouver<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WUHAN<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Wuhan is the origin city of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has influenced global attitudes towards East Asian communities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN PAUL CATUNGAL<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>John Paul Catungal commented on the global phenomenon of increased hate crimes against East Asian people due to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TORONTO POLICE SERVICE<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The Toronto Police Service has not reported an increase in hate crimes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, contrasting with Vancouver's situation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STATISTICS CANADA<|>TORONTO POLICE SERVICE<|>Statistics Canada collects data on hate crimes, which includes information relevant to the activities of the Toronto Police Service<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
