In an open letter to\nschool leaders in Boston, Quincy, and Malden, a coalition of Asian-American students and their supporters is\nurging educators to take action now to ensure their safety as a new school year begins.“In school, we feel we are not equal to other students. Whether it be among our peers, with faculty members in-\nperson or online, it is suffocating to know there are those who look at us cautiously and choose to ignore therising issue of xenophobia in the U.S.,” the letter said. “Our mental health is deteriorating, and our grades will\ndrop, impacting our futures in higher education. We feel unsafe returning to schools with unaddressed racism.”\nAsian Americans have endured an onslaught of bullying and abuse in the months since the coronavirus outbreak\nerupted in China. Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative of several California-based Asian American civil rights\norganizations, has tracked more than 2,500 hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders\nbetween mid-March and early August, including reports of workplace discrimination, online harassment, and\nphysical assaults.\nStop AAPI Hate recorded 61 such incidents in Massachusetts.\nCivil rights groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League, have accused President Trump and public officials of exacerbating anti-Asian sentiment by referring to COVID-19 as “the Chinese virus” or “kung flu.”\nThe open letter, posted Sept. 21, has garnered more than 60 online signatures from students, teachers, parents,\nand community members in and around Boston. Seventeen-year-old Sarah Xu, one of the six students who\ncoauthored the letter, organized the campaign through the nonprofit Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center.\nShe got the idea from a class at Boston Latin School, where she's now a senior, called “Facing History and\nOurselves.\" The class, Xu said, examines “the unspoken narratives of different oppressed populations.\" Shortly\nbefore Boston schools closed, the class began discussing the recent surge of anti-Asian prejudice. With help\nfrom the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, she and the other students started drafting the letter this\nspring. They finished polishing it just in time for the new school year.\n“I was definitely afraid and anxious because this has never happened in my lifetime so far,\" Xu said in an\ninterview Monday, regarding the troubling rise in anti-Asian bigotry. “I'm thankful for the fact that I haven't\npersonally been attacked yet and I'm also in a community that keeps me safe.”\nBut in March, Xu still detected tension in her classes at Boston Latin, where roughly 30 percent of the students\nare of Asian descent.\n“It did feel uncomfortable at times when people would talk about COVID,\" she said. \"People couldn't help but\nlook at the Asians in the room.”\nIn the letter, the students described being stared at while walking down the street or riding the train. They\ncannot go to the grocery store, they wrote, “without fear of strangers harassing us.\"\n“For me, I'm Chinese, so I wore masks very early,” 17-year-old Xi Zheng, a senior at North Quincy High School\nand one of letter writers, told the Globe. She said she's afraid of leaving her home and “being attacked by a\nracist.”\n“People look at me very strangely,\" she continued, “and I feel very uncomfortable.”\nThe students asked school leaders “to stand in solidarity with communities of color” by publicly speaking out\nagainst racism; hiring more diverse faculty and staff; hosting monthly anti-bias trainings; and teaching Ethnic\nStudies. They also requested a system for “reporting incidents of racism,\" and listening sessions and healing\ncircles for students and families.\nLetter writer Mandy Sun, who is also 17 and a senior at Boston Latin, said racism against Asian Americans is\n“normalized,\" which she hadn't fully realized until the pandemic began. She recalled an incident in the spring,\nwhen a white student at a nearby suburban high school wrote a scathing Facebook post blaming the virus on\nChinese people. Despite the student's outburst, her school didn't reprimand her, Sun said, because the student\nlater apologized on social media.\n“It made me feel, at first, angry, and I started thinking, 'How are we going to move on from this? How are we\ngoing to create a better society?' I feel like the only people who got outraged were in the Asian-American\ncommunity,\" Sun said. The episode left her feeling “slightly hopeless.”\nBoston Public Schools spokesman Jonathan Palumbo said the district is reviewing the letter and working on a\nresponse to the students. In an interview with the Globe on Tuesday, Malden Public Schools superintendent John\nOteri reiterated the district's commitment to anti-racism teaching and training.\n“I think when you're doing anti-racism, anti-bias [work], you're trying to undo generations and, frankly,\ncenturies of systemic oppression. It's going to take awhile and it's always going to be a work in progress,” he\nsaid. “I want to make Malden the most equitable, welcoming, inclusive school community, where people feel like\nthey belong.”\nThe superintendent of Quincy Public Schools, Kevin Mulvey, did not return requests for comment.\n“Young people are very much concerned about these issues and very much want to use their voice to make\nchange, so this was a way for them to do that,” said Ben Hires, CEO of the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood\nCenter, who signed onto the letter as a supporter. “To me, it's just inspiring to see these young people use\ntheir voices\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
