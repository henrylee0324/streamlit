They feel like they don't\nbelong. We want to make sure that they know they are part of the county.\"\nA \"Stand Up to Hate\" rally is scheduled for 11 a.m. Sunday outside the Nassau County Legislative Building in Mineola.\nPainful memories\nFor those who have endured the sting of racism and marginalization, the wave of anti-Asian discrimination has evoked painful\nmemories and opened new wounds.\nWhen Wong was about 8, she said her family heard a loud bang on the door one night at their house in Bayside, Queens. When her\nparents opened the door, the family saw newspapers lit on fire in front of their doorstep. It wasn't until they put the fire out that they\nrealized that the newspapers were wrapped around feces.\n\"That was such a difficult thing to experience as a child because you realize there are people that don't like you just for the way\nyou look,\" said Wong, who is in her 40s.\nGrowing up, she said people used racial slurs toward her and made assumptions about the language she spoke - even though\nEnglish is her first language - that Wong said sent her a clear message.\n\"Being born here and just looking different ... and then being berated for that made it clear that I did not belong,\" she said.\nLast week, Lucy Wu, 42, of Manhasset, said she was sprayed by windshield washer fluid during an unprovoked encounter as a man\ndrove away from the parking lot of a Manhasset grocery store. No words were exchanged between them, and Wu said she did not\nreport it to police.\n\"There was mist all over my face,\" she said. \"It was unpleasant, and it ruined [my] day.\"\nA couple of weeks ago, she said someone dropped a bag of dog feces at her driveway. She wondered if what happened was merely\ncoincidental.\n\"Maybe to some people, it's hard to see those moments as racially charged aggressive moves,\" Wu said. \"It sucks that we even\nhave to think that we're overthinking. By definition, we shouldn't have to even have that frame of mind and ask if it's safe to be\noutdoors.\"\nThat fear is part of the reason Wu said she opted for remote learning for her three children. Wu said she and other Asian parents\nare worried about COVID-19 exposures as well as their children being subject to discrimination.\n\"We feel scared that we are going to be blamed,\" said Wu, a Chinese American. \"This is why we keep our kids at home.\"\nPsychological effect\nResearchers said experiences like microaggressions, harassment, experiences of threats or even anticipation of being mistreated\ncan lead to racial trauma.\n\"It's the sum total of our experiences of this kind of harm that has a psychological, compounding effect,\" said Doris Chang, an\nassociate professor at New York University.\nChang said the feelings of vulnerability and not being safe in one's environment create a psychological experience of anxiety,\nwhich could trigger a hypervigilant response.\nWhen Luk is out with her children, she said she is always scanning her environment.\n\"I constantly have to watch our backs,\" the mother of three said.\nAs Luk coached her children on math problems during remote learning last week, she wondered out loud what the future holds for\nthem.\n\"What kind of world will my kids grow up in?\" she said. \"They are innocent souls - unless something happens to them.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FARAH MOZAWALLA<|>PERSON<|>Farrah Mozawalla is the executive director of Nassau County's Office of Asian American Affairs, addressing anti-Asian harassment incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Nassau County is a region where reports of anti-Asian harassment incidents have been received.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAND UP TO HATE RALLY<|>EVENT<|>A rally scheduled to take place outside the Nassau County Legislative Building to combat hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINEOLA<|>GEO<|>Mineola is the location of the Nassau County Legislative Building where the rally is scheduled.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WONG<|>PERSON<|>Wong is a person who experienced racism and marginalization, recalling a traumatic childhood incident.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCY WU<|>PERSON<|>Lucy Wu is a resident of Manhasset who experienced an unprovoked aggressive encounter and is concerned about discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANHASSET<|>GEO<|>Manhasset is a location where Lucy Wu experienced an aggressive encounter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DORIS CHANG<|>PERSON<|>Doris Chang is an associate professor at New York University who studies the psychological effects of racial trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>New York University is an educational institution where Doris Chang works and conducts research on racial trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a pandemic that has raised concerns among Asian parents regarding exposure and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUK<|>PERSON<|>Luk is a mother of three who is concerned about the safety of her children in the current environment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAH MOZAWALLA<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>Farrah Mozawalla works for Nassau County's Office of Asian American Affairs, addressing local issues of harassment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STAND UP TO HATE RALLY<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>The rally is organized in Nassau County to combat hate and support the Asian American community<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STAND UP TO HATE RALLY<|>MINEOLA<|>The rally is scheduled to take place outside the Nassau County Legislative Building in Mineola<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WONG<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>Wong's experiences of racism are part of the broader context of anti-Asian sentiments in Nassau County<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCY WU<|>MANHASSET<|>Lucy Wu experienced an aggressive encounter in Manhasset, highlighting local issues of discrimination<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DORIS CHANG<|>NEW YORK UNIVERSITY<|>Doris Chang is affiliated with New York University, where she researches racial trauma<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUK<|>COVID-19<|>Luk's concerns for her children's safety are influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated discrimination<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
