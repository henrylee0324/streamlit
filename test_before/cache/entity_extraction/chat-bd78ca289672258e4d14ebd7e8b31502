The man pulled the\npapers from his glove compartment and leaned toward the window. But Officer Allison didn't touch them.\nHe reached instead for his cellphone.\n\"OK, I'm just going to take a picture of that,\" Officer Allison told the man.\nOfficer Allison, 34, patrols southwest Norman, where a stay-at-home order is in effect and four nursing home residents have died from the pandemic. Norman is different now,\nand so is policing. The most prosaic parts of the job have become potential hazmat situations.\nOfficers used to sit two to a table for pre-shift briefings at headquarters, but social distancing put an end to roll call. Officers also keep their distance from one another when\nthey go out on calls. On Tuesday, the officer's lunch got a wipe-down: He used Clorox wipes to disinfect his milkshake, tea and wrapped straws.\nAt the end of his shift, he used to park his police S.U.V. outside his house, walk inside and hug his wife, 5-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son. Now, he pulls straight into the\ngarage, undresses there, stuffs his uniform into the washing machine, disinfects his equipment and then heads straight for the shower before touching anyone.\nIt turned out that the Chrysler's license plate didn't match the vehicle. Maybe it was stolen. Maybe the driver hadn't registered it yet. From the driver's seat of the S.U.V., the\nofficer asked for backup. Then he readied himself to face the driver again. He reached over to the passenger seat for his blue cloth mask.\n-- Manny Fernandez\nOrlando, Fla.\nKimberley Mitchell, a second-generation funeral director, gathered the grieving family in her office. In the age of social distancing, her only goal was to help them hang on to the\ntiniest bit of cultural tradition.\nMs. Mitchell of Mitchell's Funeral Home looked into the eyes of the family representative seated across the room. A month ago, she would have placed her hand on the relative's\nshoulder as a gesture of comfort.\nOn this afternoon, she gently laid out the dizzying, surreal set of safety rules reshaping how America buries its dead. The family settled on a simple half-hour service in the\nchapel. It has 22 rows of pews -- room for seven mourners, a pastor and two staff members. They also decided to hold a memorial service once the country returned to normal.\n\"It feels something like 'to be continued' for some people saying goodbye to their loved ones,\" she said.\nBefore the crisis, Ms. Mitchell greeted family members reeling from loss with hugs. Now, it was simply too risky. Now mourners had to move through reposing rooms in shifts,\none small group at a time.\nIt was jarring. And exhausting. And unmooring.\nBut Ms. Mitchell still had her smile and her words. She could still offer hope and the promise of healing by reciting from the 30th chapter of Psalms -- \"joy cometh in the\nmorning.\"\n\"The hardest thing is to see someone grieving alone,\" she said. \"Think about that. Alone.\"\n-- Audra D.S. Burch\nPascagoula, Miss.\nDr. Steven Demetropoulos had been seeing patients since 7:10 a.m. He was tired, but he was also a man on a mission.\nHe needed to drive home in his pickup truck so he could quickly change clothes before heading back out, straight to City Hall, where he hoped to convince the Council to enact a\ncurfew.\nIn February, Dr. Demetropoulos became the mayor of Pascagoula, a Gulf Coast city of about 21,000 people. He ran on a platform of economic growth and beautification.\nBut now he also makes videos for residents about how to survive the worst public health crisis in decades. \"This is Dr. Steve, your mayor,\" he tells them, dressed in green scrubs\nbehind the mayor's desk.\nTomorrow he would make another video, about how droplets spread through the air and why it was important that people stay six feet apart.\nHis advice is not limited to physical health.\n\"Keep trusting, keep praying,\" he said in one video. \"We will get through this together.\"\n-- Rick Rojas\nPortsmouth, Ohio\nKalee Kamer was in bed, snuggled next to her boyfriend and their cat, Dirtball, participating in a drug recovery meeting streaming on Facebook Live.Ms. Kamer -- 27 months sober after decades of addiction to heroin, meth, crack and whatever else she could get her hands on -- lost her burger-joint waitressing job on March\n15. She and her boyfriend, Chris Keeton, who is also in recovery, have cleaned the house so thoroughly it practically gleams. They watch four or five virtual recovery meetings a\nweek.\nIn this small city, the center of Ohio's opioid epidemic, temptation is never far.\nThe couple's gazes are fixed on the Facebook session, hosted by a local drug recovery group called Raw Addiction.\nKathy Newman, a drug treatment counselor nearly nine years in recovery, urged viewers like Ms. Kamer to stick with the program. Flurries of emojis rose across the screen as\nviewers cheered in support.\nHundreds of comments appeared in real time -- testaments of hope and despair that would, in normal times, be shared face-to-face.\nI'm afraid of picking up the needle again ... I need out.\nI'm in rehab.\nApril 6th will be 18 months clean from shooting up. You guys are such a great inspiration.\nMs. Kamer, 32, wrote one: Did 2 years in prison.
