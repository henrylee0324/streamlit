Around 14.5% of the city is part of the Asian American community. Philadelphia and Cleveland both went up 200%, while Los Angeles went up by 114%. \nThe first spike in anti-Asian hate crimes started in March and April of last year, when the pandemic began to send the country into lockdown. In March, the FBI warned of an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans in light of COVID-19. \n\"The FBI assesses hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the United States, due to the spread of coronavirus disease … endangering Asian American communities,\" an FBI intelligence report said, according to ABC News. \n\"The FBI makes this assessment based on the assumption that a portion of the U.S. public will associate COVID-19 with China and Asian American populations,” it continued. \nIn recent weeks, a number of crimes targeting older Asian Americans have shed light on the issue, prompting local officials to ramp up their calls to report racist incidents. \nNew York City launched the Asian Hate Crime Task Force to focus on the entire city with a special eye on the transit system after a number of incidents occurred on the subway. \nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER \n\"Every community suffered, but there's been a particular pain, a particular horrible challenge, faced by the Asian American community,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said. \"Because on top of all the suffering from the coronavirus itself, on top of losing loved ones losing businesses, people have had to confront horrible discrimination and hatred.\" \nThe coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 29 million people in the United States, with over 525,000 deaths attributed to the virus. \nPhoto Caption:This photo from Saturday March 28, 2020, shows a lone jogger on a deserted Manhattan street after citywide after COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in New York.
