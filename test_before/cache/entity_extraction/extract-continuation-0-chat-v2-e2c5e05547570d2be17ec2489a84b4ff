It was the rise of China that helped this sparsely populated vast continent to avoid a recession for the past three decades, the most extended period of economic growth in Australian history.\nRather than being thankful to China, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne in a local TV interview on April 19 called for an \"independent\" inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 in Wuhan expressing concerns about transparency from China on the issue.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison emphasised that in subsequent media briefings and he led a campaign with the support of the European Union (EU) to press the World Health Assembly (WHA) to trigger an independent probe.\nThough the WHA passed the resolution on May 15 with China co-sponsoring it, the outcome was far from what Australia (and the U.S.) wanted. It even led to a spat with the Chinese Embassy in Canberra that issued a statement saying that it is \"a joke\" to claim that the WHO adopted the Australian initiative.\n\"Australia and the United States have been particularly close since the Second World War. When we were at risk of invasion they became our Allies and remained so,\" former Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock told IDN in an interview.\nWhen asked how the Government of John Howard - who publicly said that Australia could be the U.S.'s deputy Sheriff in Asia - handled the relationship with China, he said. \"(We were) able to manage some difficult issues with China through regular Human Rights dialogues.\" Ruddock was part of the Howard Cabinet.\n  \"independent\" investigation\nMorrison started the campaign for a so-called \"independent\" investigation, at a time when the media coverage here on the COVID-19 issue had invoked the \"yellow peril\" prejudices of the 19th century that fuelled the 'White Australia' policy. It was lifted only in the late 1970s when Asia was seen as a potential cash cow for Australia. It did, and until the advent of COVID-19, tourists and international students from China, and Chinese mineral and food imports were the major foreign currency earners for the country going into billions of dollars.\n\"We need to look at the risk factors of the pandemic and the cost and benefits. A blame game will not achieve a constructive and beneficial bilateral relationship between Australia and China,\" argues Tony Pang, past president of Chinese Australian Forum, pointing out that 90 per cent of Australian exports go to Asia with China taking 37.2 per cent of it. At the same time, the U.S. accounts for only 3.8 per cent according to 2019 data.\n\"I believe, to some extent, the current racism against Asians is a result of China's growth, influence and economic might and the adverse media coverage over the last few years, and especially after the arrival of Covid-19,\" he told IDN.\nAndrew Jakubowicz, Emeritus Professor of Sociology from the University of Technology Sydney told IDN in an interview that \"the language used was either intentionally inflammatory or recklessly loose and undisciplined\".\nHe added: \"Even China recognises that an inquiry-based on the scientific method that rigorously interrogates the emergence of the virus and the more or less successful modes of address across the world, is an excellent idea. Though not one that seeks out evidence to convict China of some unnamed crime\".\nIn the past two weeks, China has shown in no uncertain terms, through media briefing from China's Ambassador Jingye Cheng in Canberra and Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijianin in Beijing that the Chinese Government is unhappy with the way Australia called for such an inquiry. They have already imposed economic sanctions against Australia dressed up as anti-dumping and hygienic measures.\nOn May 18, the Chinese Government announced it would press ahead with its threat to impose an 80 per cent tariff on Australian barley - effectively blocking Australian farmers from selling their crops to their most lucrative market. They claimed that the Australian Government was subsidising the farmers to \"dump\" barley on the Chinese market at below production costs.\nOn May 19, Beijing has slapped Australian beef exporters with sanctions for \"repeated violations of inspection and quarantine requirements\". Trade Minister Simon Birmingham was at pains not to paint it as economic retaliation from China, but \"isolated labelling error\" that will be corrected.\nCOVID-19 lockdowns\nSanctions could hit hard on an economy already facing a severe crisis from both the impact of bushfires in the summer and now COVID-19 lockdowns. This week Birmingham complained that his Chinese counterpart was refusing to take calls to discuss the issue. He has hinted that Australia may have to take the barley tariffs to the WTO disputes process.\nThe Chinese ambassador has also hinted at the Chinese consumers \"losing the taste\" for Australian wines. China is Australia's biggest wine market. Wine-maker Bill Widen told ABC TV that for three years they have been selling wines to China. Before the COVID-19 crisis, they have been sending every two months a container full of 18,000 bottles of wine to China. \"The most popular wine at the moment in China, by volume, is Australian wine, so Australian producers have made inroads into the China market,\" he said.\nHis wife Vicki visibly upset at the impact Australia's call for an inquiry may have on their business added: \"You spend many many years building a relationship with a country. And if you lose that relationship with China . it will be devastating, not only for us here.\"\nAustralian commercial media, in particular, have been drumming up anti-China sentiments in the country by repeatedly claiming that China is using its economic muscle to bully Australia, after spreading the coronavirus\nacross the globe. They are also appealing to widespread resentments among Australians of Chinese purchases of large Australian assets as well as real estate in recent years\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Australia is a country facing a potential deep recession, influenced by its economic relationship with China and the impact of COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country that has been a significant economic partner for Australia, but is currently facing scrutiny due to the origins of COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARISE PAYNE<|>PERSON<|>Marise Payne is the Australian Foreign Minister who called for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTT MORRISON<|>PERSON<|>Scott Morrison is the Prime Minister of Australia who led a campaign for an independent investigation into COVID-19 origins.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN UNION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Union is a political and economic union that supported Australia in its campaign for an independent probe into COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Assembly is the decision-making body of the World Health Organization that passed a resolution regarding an inquiry into COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHILLIP RUDDOCK<|>PERSON<|>Phillip Ruddock is a former Immigration Minister of Australia who commented on the historical relationship between Australia and the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN HOWARD<|>PERSON<|>John Howard is a former Prime Minister of Australia known for his comments on Australia's relationship with the U.S. in Asia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TONY PANG<|>PERSON<|>Tony Pang is the past president of the Chinese Australian Forum who discussed the economic implications of Australia's relationship with China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDREW JAKUBOWICZ<|>PERSON<|>Andrew Jakubowicz is an Emeritus Professor of Sociology who commented on the media's portrayal of the inquiry into COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JINGYE CHENG<|>PERSON<|>Jingye Cheng is the Chinese Ambassador in Canberra who expressed China's dissatisfaction with Australia's inquiry call.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHAO LIJIAN<|>PERSON<|>Zhao Lijian is a Foreign Affairs spokesman for China who communicated the Chinese government's stance on Australia's inquiry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILL WIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Bill Widen is a wine-maker who discussed the impact of Australia's inquiry on the Australian wine market in China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICKI WIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Vicki Widen is Bill Widen's wife who expressed concern over the potential loss of business relationships with China.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARISE PAYNE<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Marise Payne, as the Foreign Minister, is advocating for an independent inquiry that affects Australia's international relations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTT MORRISON<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Scott Morrison is leading the campaign for an inquiry that could impact Australia's economy and relations with China<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN UNION<|>AUSTRALIA<|>The European Union supported Australia's initiative for an independent inquiry into COVID-19<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY<|>AUSTRALIA<|>The World Health Assembly passed a resolution that Australia pushed for regarding an inquiry into COVID-19<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHILLIP RUDDOCK<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Phillip Ruddock commented on Australia's historical alliances, particularly with the U.S., which is relevant to its current stance<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN HOWARD<|>AUSTRALIA<|>John Howard's past comments on Australia being the U.S.'s deputy Sheriff in Asia relate to the current geopolitical context<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TONY PANG<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Tony Pang's insights on the economic relationship between Australia and China highlight the stakes involved in the inquiry<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDREW JAKUBOWICZ<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Andrew Jakubowicz's comments on media portrayal relate to the public perception of Australia's inquiry into COVID-19<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JINGYE CHENG<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Jingye Cheng's statements reflect China's response to Australia's inquiry, indicating a diplomatic relationship<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZHAO LIJIAN<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Zhao Lijian's comments represent the Chinese government's official stance on Australia's inquiry, affecting bilateral relations<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILL WIDEN<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Bill Widen's concerns about the impact of the inquiry on the wine industry illustrate economic ties between Australia and China<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICKI WIDEN<|>BILL WIDEN<|>Vicki Widen's emotional response to the potential loss of business reflects the personal impact of international relations<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
