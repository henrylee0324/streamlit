There were 27 racially motivated\ncrimes against people of Asian descent reported last year, compared to one in 2019, according to the NYPD.\nAcross the country in 2020, there were almost 3,000 reports of anti-Asian discrimination between March 19 and\nDec. 31, according to the Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.The problem has been highlighted by a string of recent assaults, including a January attack that killed 84-year-\nold Vicha Ratanapakdee in San Francisco in January. In February, a group of Korean American teens from NorthJersey faced a verbal assault in New York's Times Square. Leonia High School sophomore Yena Choe said a\nmiddle-aged woman glared at the group of face-masked youths and told them, \"Get away from me!\" while waving her hands.\nIn Wyckoff, meanwhile, a Chinese restaurant was vandalized last June with the words \"coronavirus\" and \"go\nhome\" spray-painted on the windows and sidewalk.\nDuring his first prime-time address to the nation Thursday, President Joe Biden denounced violent attacks\nagainst Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic as un-American.\nDiscussing how the pandemic had served to divide and antagonize Americans on a range of issues, Biden called\nout \"vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans who've been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated.\"\n\"At this very moment, so many of them, our fellow Americans, are on the front lines of this pandemic trying to\nsave lives,\" Biden said.\n\"And still, still they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It's wrong, it's\nun-American and it must stop.\"\nIn Bergen County, where 17% of people identify as Asian, according to the 2019 Census, the four boroughs\nspoke out with resolutions warning not to scapegoat local residents just because the virus originated in China.\nThe text of the resolutions is as follows:\nCondemn and denounce racism, xenophobia and intolerance in all forms.\nCall on public officials in other municipalities and at the state level to condemn and denounce racism,\nxenophobia and intolerance in all forms and stand with us in solidarity with the Asian and Asian Americans and\nPacific Islanders communities.\nContinues to promote and advocate for equality and equity through all policies approved by the mayor and\ncouncil.\nRecognize the dedication of Asian and Asian-American frontline medical workers, teachers, police and fire\nofficers and essential workers.\nContinue to advocate locally and through the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, New Jersey Conference\nof Mayors and all other appropriate associations for relevant policies that improve health in communities of\ncolor.\nSupport local, state, regional, and federal initiatives that advance efforts to dismantle systemic racism.\nFurther work to solidify alliances and partnerships with other organizations that are confronting racism and\nencourage other local, state, regional and national entities to recognize racism as a public health crisis.\nSupport community efforts to amplify community efforts to be anti-racist and to combat discrimination and\nxenophobia while engaging actively and authentically with communities of color wherever they live.\nPromote and support policies and resources that prioritize the health of all people, such as bystander\nintervention programs.\nEncourage racial equity training among all community partners, vendors and contractors.\nCall upon Bergen County Executive Tedesco and the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders to declare\nracism as a public health crisis and to enact equity in all policies in the County of Bergen.\nCall upon Governor Murphy, State Senate President Sweeney, and State Assembly Speaker Coughlin to also declare racism as a public health crisis and to enact equity in all policies of the state of New Jersey.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
