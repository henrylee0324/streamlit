His inbox filled with threats or anti-Asian slurs,\nspurring Lee to take a hiatus from Twitter.\nAnd then, in the second week of March – the same week that the World Health Organization declared the\nvirus to be a pandemic – reality seemed to finally, if only partially, set in for the United States.\nIn a span of two days, the National Basketball Association suspended its season. Tom Hanks announced\nthat he had COVID-19. And Trump declared a national emergency while banning many Europeans from\nentering the United States, adding to a partial ban on some foreign nationals who had visited China.\nLee's employer, Mount Sinai, closed all biology labs, except for those doing research related to COVID-19.\nLee pivoted to making an ingredient to test people's blood for the virus.\nThe emergency declaration was, in the estimation of international scientists, long overdue, coming six\nweeks after the WHO had already declared the virus to be a global public health emergency.\nAmericans around the country would soon enter lockdowns. It was a fearful and painful moment, but also\none where the damage from previous inaction was not yet set, said Ranney, the doctor and professor. She\nsaid that the federal government could have attempted to catch up on infrastructures for testing, contact\ntracing, and distributing PPE.\n\"But we didn't,\" she said.\nEaster: 27,342 deaths\nOn March 17, two men hustled into a nearly-empty rest stop in Maryland. Four hours into their 1,200-mile\ndrive from New York to Florida, they realized they weren't going to make it on sandwiches and PowerBars alone, and stopped to fortify with Wendy's cheeseburgers.\nOne of the men was middle-aged and svelte. The other was more than two decades older, hobbled but\nstill sprightly, with an oxygen tank piped to his nose and slung over his shoulder like a school bag. They\nwore face masks weeks before the CDC recommended them, and latex gloves.\nAs they exited the rest stop for the highway, Tom Kirdahy, then 56, and Terrence McNally, 81, felt safer\nwith each mile they put between themselves and New York. It was as if they could feel the virus\nreceding behind them.\nThey were near the front of a great informal migration southward from the New York City area.\nWhile other countries instituted national lockdown orders to freeze citizens and the virus in place, the\nUnited States had only localized, and relatively lax, versions of such edicts. Americans responded by\nmoving more than ever.\nMcNally fled New York with husband Kirdahy because he had only three-quarters of a lung left and was\nterrified the virus would make quick work of him.\nThe couple's history together had another pandemic as a backdrop. In 1995, Kirdahy, an attorney\nrepresenting those infected with HIV and AIDS, was transfixed in a Broadway theater as he watched a\ngay male character kiss a purple scar on the chest of another.\nIn Kirdahy's view, society had decided that eradicating the AIDS epidemic was not a priority because\nthose it was killing, mostly gay men, were considered no great loss.\nHe had held the hands of many gay men as they died without the presence of family members who\nwere afraid of infection or disdainful of their sexuality.\nSo attending \"Love! Valour! Compassion!\" written by McNally, whom Kirdahy then only knew as a famed\nplaywright, was \"like being in church,\" he said.\nIt was the story of eight gay men on vacation together, including one, played by Nathan Lane, who\nkissed the AIDS lesion of another. Kirdahy and his companions at the theater, all of whom worked on the\nAIDS front lines or were infected with the virus, wept and hugged each other.\nKirdahy, a lifelong theater buff, met McNally six years later after inviting him to join a panel of famed\ngay playwrights he organized in the Hamptons, New York. They bonded over a shared familiarity with\nAIDS. Two of McNally's previous partners had died of the virus, and the playwright had seen firsthand\nthe isolation suffered by its victims in their last moments.\nThey married in 2003, with Kirdahy warning that he wasn't going to shelve his ambition and become\n\"Mrs. McNally.\" He ultimately left his law practice to become one of the most prolific theater producers\non Broadway and London's West End, racking up armfuls of theater awards to rival those of his\nhusband.\nBut a diagnosis only months after they had started dating injected their relationship with a perpetually\nfleeting quality. McNally's former three-pack-a-day smoking habit had stricken him with lung cancer.\nSurgery left him with a quarter of his right lung and only half of his left. For decades he was in and out\nof the hospital, including with potentially life-ending bouts of pneumonia.\nMcNally made light of it. When he and Kirdahy bought a vacation apartment in Sarasota, Florida, in\n2017, McNally predicted he would die there. \"I know how this story ends,\" he joked.\nAnd in June 2019, when he was awarded a Tony for lifetime achievement, he accepted it with his oxygen\ntank attached and told the crowd: \"Not a moment too soon.\"\nDuring the first weeks of March, when it became clear that New York City was usurping the Seattle area as a national epicenter of coronavirus, they made hasty plans to drive to the apartment in Florida\nuntil its spread blew over.\nAt a roadside motel room in North Carolina\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
