What the intent of using those words actually is. Make no\nmistake about it, it is 100% racism and for the people who say it, and the people who look past it, and the people who don't immediately\ndenounce it, and denounce it every time that is said, you are complicit actors in spreading the kind of racism that ultimately has escalated itself\ninto violence and murder.\nI fear that the violence against Asian Americans will only get worse. I fear that people like me, who have a platform, who have the responsibility\nand opportunity to speak out, could be the next victims of violence. It's a fear that I carry with me everywhere I go. Every knock at the door.\nEvery time I get out of the car to fill up my gas tank. Every time I run to the grocery store. It's a fear that will always be there as long as people\nwho are in power and who seek power see fit to use racism as their preferred instrument of war.\nIf the events of Jan. 6 should tell us anything, it's that members of the Cult of Trump take very literally the extreme and dangerous things said by\nDonald Trump and his fellow arsonists of democracy. They aren't just empty words. They are directives. They are orders. And these white\nnationalists are willing to act on them.\nAccording to Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, there have been more than 3,000 reports of\nracism and discrimination against Asian Americans in the past year. Two weeks ago, a man was caught on tape attacking an Asian American\nwoman in Flushing, Queens, a main hub for the Asian American community. An 84-year old Asian American was attacked while taking a walk\nthrough his Bay Area neighborhood, and he died two days later. The rise in violence prompted the state of California to commit $1.4 million\ntoward helping Asian Americans report hate crimes.\nThe Biden administration released an executive order acknowledging \"the Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in\nfurthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the\ngeographic location of its origin. Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific\nIslanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.\"\nIt's a symbolic first step and a meaningful one after watching the highest officeholder in the land use the White House microphone to hurl racial\nslurs against the AAPI community for a year. But the reality is we need more than just symbolic gestures and occasional mentions. Asian Americans are under siege.\nJust last week, a 36-year-old Asian American man walking down the street in New York City was attacked and stabbed in the torso. A family in\nOrange County is the target of habitual harassment, so much so that neighbors have taken to literally guarding the family's home. I was talking\nto a college student the other day who shared with me the story of how she was walking downtown in San Francisco, and a man came up to her\nand just spit on her. Just the other day, after appearing on MSNBC, I got a two-word message from a person that read, \"retard chinaman.\"\nThe fact is Asian Americans are not safe in their homes. They aren't safe walking down the street. They aren't safe on the subway. They aren't\nsafe at restaurants. They aren't safe anywhere. It's 2021, and one of the two major political parties in America is applauding the provocation of\nhate crimes against the AAPI community.\nThe Republican Party has declared open season on Asian Americans. Our blood is on their hands.\nKurt Bardella is a Korean-American, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and a former Republican.
