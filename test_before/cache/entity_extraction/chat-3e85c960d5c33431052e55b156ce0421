She\nonce had a budding American dream, but now she says she is facing hostility in that country.\n“As a Chinese living in the US, I am very scared now,” she says. Tie, now a senior student at Johns Hopkins University,\ndescribes America as “anti-China” and “chaotic”.\nSome 360,000 Chinese students are currently enrolled in schools in the US. In the past months, they have experienced\ntwo historical events – a global pandemic and unprecedented tensions between the US and China, which have reshaped\ntheir views of the two nations.\n‘Politicised’ and ‘anxious’\nThe majority of Chinese students in the US are self-funded and hope their western education will lead to a good career.\nMeanwhile, Washington has warned that not all students from China are “normal”, claiming some are Beijing’s proxies\nwho conduct economic espionage, orchestrate pro-China views and monitor other Chinese students on American campuses.\nThe Trump administration recently cancelled visas for 3,000 students they believe have ties to the Chinese military. One\nUS senator even suggested that Chinese nationals should be banned from studying math and science in America.\nAmid the harsh rhetoric, many Chinese students fear that they are being turned into a political target for Washington.\nTie, majoring in environmental science, says she is pessimistic about her academic future in the US, given the growing\nscrutiny over Chinese students and scholars in science and technology.\n“I used to think I’d pursue my PhD in the US and perhaps settle down here, but now I see myself returning to China\nafter obtaining a master’s degree,” Tie says.\nYingyi Ma, associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University, says Chinese students in the US are now “politicised\nand marginalised at an unprecedented level”, as Washington is sending “very unfriendly signals”.\nThe strained bilateral relations have swayed public opinion, as a recent survey found that 73% of American adults have\nan unfavourable view of China – an historic high.\nProf Ma published a book called Ambitious and Anxious this January, focusing on Chinese students’ experience in\nAmerica.\n“If I write the book now, I will only keep ‘anxious’ in the title,” she says.\n‘Unwanted’ at home\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread in the US, Tie prefers to return to China, where the outbreak appears to be\nlargely under control.\nBut the country has ordered sharp cuts in international flights to prevent imported cases, leaving many Chinese students\noverseas, stranded thousands of miles away from their families.\nOn Chinese social media, some comments portrayed these students as spoiled brats, who had fled from the country’s\nfiercely competitive education system and now may imperil its success in containing the virus.\n“America wants to kick us out, while China doesn’t allow us to return,” Tie says.\nThis sentiment is commonly shared among Chinese students in the US.\nIris Li, a 20-year-old junior student from China at Emory University in Atlanta, describes the students as “being kicked\nlike a ball” between the two countries.\n“We are getting the short end of the stick from both sides,” Li says.\nRacism ‘boosts’ support for Beijing\nAfter worrying about the outbreak in their home country from afar, these young Chinese are now witnessing the\ncoronavirus crisis in the US.\nThey were perplexed by the cultural differences regarding mask-wearing. They were unsettled by President Trump’s use\nof the phrases “kung flu” and “China virus”. Some have even experienced racial harassment firsthand.\nRacial discrimination during the pandemic has “burst their bubble,” Prof Ma says.\nA new paper stated that anti-Chinese racism boosts support for Beijing’s authoritarian rule among Chinese students in\nthe US.\nJennifer Pan, co-author of the paper and assistant professor of Communications at Stanford University, says there is a\ngeneral belief that Chinese students overseas are indoctrinated to wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist\nParty.\n“That’s not the case,” Prof Pan says, “What does change their political views is racism.”\nThe research found that college freshmen from China who read derogatory comments against Chinese people are\nmore likely to support Beijing, while general criticism against the government’s coronavirus handling did not produce\nthe same effects.\nProf Pan says the findings suggest that Chinese students in the US, whose survey responses are “mature,\nsophisticated and thoughtful for their age”, can rationally process criticism against China.\nRethinking China and America\nDespite her frustration over China’s travel restrictions, Tie says she has become more patriotic since living aboard.\n“I had believed America to be a wonderland of dreams, equality and tolerance for all. I certainly don’t believe it\nanymore,” she wrote in her school newspaper in June, criticising America’s “Sinophobia”.\nIn February, she penned an online petition, protesting against her university hosting a panel with Hong Kong\ndemocracy activists.\nBut Tie says she’s not a “little pink”, a somewhat disparaging term for nationalistic Chinese youth active on the\ninternet.\n“I am patriotic in a rational way, not as a result of brainwashing,” Tie says, adding that she views both Washington\nand Beijing critically, citing the lack of freedom of speech in China.\n“Both countries let me down many times,” Tie says, “but China is my motherland, so\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
