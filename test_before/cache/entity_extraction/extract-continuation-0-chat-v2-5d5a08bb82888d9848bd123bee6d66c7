Those actions against him were not something he\nwill be able to prove to those people to be wrong; they come from a fundamental dehumanizing perspective held by those people.\nMr. Yang said Japanese Americans proved their loyalty and demonstrated our American-ness by serving in the military. The service of Japanese Americans in World War II was\nout of a deep love for our country and its ideals. But the families of those who died in battle were still informed of their loss behind the barbed wire of American concentration\ncamps.\nMore insidious was his promotion of the model minority myth. If we can prove our worth to white American society, then we will be accepted - at the expense of other minority\ngroups ostensibly not as worthy of acceptance. Though Asian Americans are taking the brunt of the discrimination, immigrants have also been scapegoated, and anti-Semitic\nconspiracy theories abound about the spread of the coronavirus.\nFear of covid-19 is inflaming fear of those of us who seem different. That doesn't mean we need to change who we are, nor do we need to disprove someone else's prejudices.\nWe need allies to call out those who exhibit prejudice.\nI am a proud American; I don't need to prove it to anyone.\nDavid Inoue, Washington\nThe writer is executive director for the Japanese American Citizens League.\nAs a first-generation Chinese American, I am appalled and outraged by Andrew Yang's comments on recent racist attacks against Asian Americans. Mr. Yang bent over backward\nto sympathize with and excuse the behavior of people making such attacks and insisted that Asian Americans must disarm such racism by becoming more visibly American: \"We\nneed to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear, vote, wear red white and blue, volunteer.\"\nAsian Americans have been doing, and are continuing to do, those things and more, but those acts of being \"more American\" have zero impact on people with bigotry and racial\nhatred in their hearts. Does Mr. Yang really believe that the 2-year-old Asian American girl and her 6-year-old sibling who were recently stabbed at a Sam's Club in Texas would\nhave been spared if only they had been wearing more patriotic clothing?\nIt is especially telling that Mr. Yang mentions Japanese Americans during World War II, who \"volunteered for military duty at the highest possible levels to demonstrate that they\nwere Americans.\" Yes, they did, and what did it get them? Internment in concentration camps.\nMr. Yang was blaming the victim at a time when Asian Americans are at their most vulnerable position in decades. It is not the job of victims of racism to act in a more pleasing\nway. It is the job of everyone to stand up to and fight racial injustice for all races and stop giving excuses for not doing so.\nApril Lee, Ellicott City\nI need a new thesaurus to describe President Trump's continued retaliation against and firing of patriotic Americans. Grotesque, disgusting, repellent, frightening, horrifying -\nthese words just aren't sufficient anymore.\nCall the roll: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman - who testified truthfully about Mr. Trump's egregious corrupt behavior - and his twin brother, Yevgeny Vindman, who did nothing more\nthan be his brother's twin. Capt. Brett Crozier of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, who was desperate to save his sailors' lives. Michael Atkinson, inspector general for the\nintelligence community, who was the conduit for the whistleblower complaint that led to Mr. Trump's impeachment. Former FBI director James B. Comey; former FBI deputy\ndirector Andrew McCabe; former European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland; former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Mr. Trump is firing anyone whose actions result\nin something negative for him.\nWhere is the hue and cry from the GOP senators and representatives? Is there not one spine among them?\nAs I said, I need a new thesaurus.\nSusan R. Paisner, Silver Spring\nDan Balz's April 5 The Take column, \"Once again, government is caught unprepared,\" affirmed the reality for many who have served in government that its vast authorities and\nresources can be most effectively deployed when leaders demonstrate their unequivocal belief in the agencies' missions, amplify their officials' capabilities and skills, and\nempower both the organizations and individuals to act - not just react - in times of crisis.\nMr. Balz cited the Pentagon's predilection for planning and its thorough preparedness for the last disaster, more than for the next. But its most impactful capabilities, unmatched\nby any other institution in government or business, are the ingenuity and resourcefulness of its mid-level officers, senior noncommissioned officers and technical experts,\ncombined with its relentless emphasis on individual and unit training.\nThe Iraq War revealed this national asset, as thousands of lieutenants and captains, sergeants and civilians broke through the geographic and functional silos that often impede\ninnovation by using their tactical knowledge and communications skills and systems to identify problems, convey data, improvise workarounds and share field solutions despite -\nnot because of - the established hierarchy, technological norms and conventional doctrine.\nWhen the Army War College and its sister institutions teach future officers the lessons of Gettysburg and other historic battles, they should compare the constructive\nexperiences from Iraq and other recent countercultural revolutions in military and business practices, with the negative evidence that Mr. Balz distilled from today's pandemic,\nfor the sake of generations to come.\nSandy Apgar\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ANDREW YANG<|>PERSON<|>Andrew Yang is a public figure who has commented on issues of racism and the treatment of Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPANESE AMERICAN CITIZENS LEAGUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Japanese American Citizens League is an organization advocating for the rights and interests of Japanese Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVID INOUE<|>PERSON<|>David Inoue is the executive director for the Japanese American Citizens League and has expressed views on racism against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LT.
