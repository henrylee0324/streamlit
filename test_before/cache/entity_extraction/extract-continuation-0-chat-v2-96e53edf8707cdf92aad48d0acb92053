The National Trust for Canada has listed Vancouver's Chinatown among the country's most endangered places.\nAnd a 2013 report by the Asian-American Legal Defence and Education Fund found that Asian residents went from the majority to a minority between 1990 and 2010 in the Boston, New York and Philadelphia Chinatowns.\nWhile gentrification is hardly unique to Chinatowns, the ­pressures are often more pronounced given the long histories and tight-knit structures of ­Chinese in America.\nTenant harassment, weaponised lawsuits and overzealous ­policing of street vendors are among developers' preferred tactics, said Diane Wong, a New York University faculty fellow studying Chinatown gentrification. Developers recently broke ground on a 725-unit luxury flat project and a rail hub in Los ­Angeles' Chinatown, while ­Calgary, Alberta, ­approved a massive residential tower in the heart of that city's Chinese community.\nTwo Chinese neighbourhoods in New York face similar pressure. A US$1.4 billion, 815-unit tower is being built in Manhattan's Chinatown - complete with a dog-washing room, communal herb garden and outdoor tea pavilion - and activists in Flushing are trying and fight off a 11.7-hectare luxury residential development there.\n\"We need affordable housing, and some of these apartments start at US$1 million,\" said Kim, the assemblyman. Also squeezing Chinatowns are efforts by politicians to locate undesirable projects that more ­affluent neighbourhoods shun. Manhattan's Chinatown is fighting plans to expand a prison. ­Chicago's had a big transit\nhub, and Boston's a large medical ­centre, imposed on them. Portland built a homeless shelter at Chinatown's gateway, causing businesses to flee.\n\"Chinatowns don't request these things,\" said David Lei, a board member with San Francisco's Centre for Asian- American Media. \"Chinatowns around the US don't have a say in City Hall.\"\nChinatowns are also vexed by core identity issues. Most were built for immigrant labourers who pooled their savings, started businesses and joined community ­associations. Now, increasingly wealthy, well-educated, WeChat-networked migrants flock to the suburbs, eroding the fabric of once-tight communities.\nThat's left many neighbourhoods as little more than a stop for tourists. Some believe it may be time to accept the inevitable and embrace the idea of a digital ­Chinatown.\nWashington, DC, is among the best examples of a vanishing ­Chinatown, while Detroit's has completely disappeared.\n\"They've become tourist destinations, with everything from sports to Shakespeare, upscale bowling alleys and shopping centres,\" said Frank Wu, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings. \"But they don't actually involve Chinese people.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NORTH AMERICAN CHINATOWNS<|>GEO<|>North
