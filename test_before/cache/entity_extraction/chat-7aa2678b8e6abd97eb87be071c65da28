Shay is unfussed. \"I do find it odd that she wants to compete with me,\" she purrs. \"But she cannot compete with what I was born into.\"\n\"There are certainly discussions on new money versus old money,\" Christine tells me when I ask about the characters' different attitudes towards wealth. \"I'm of a younger generation, so I am more open to\nspeaking about consumption. But I don't do it in a way of boasting. I know the show is edited in that way, unfortunately, because people are hooked by the bling and the glitz, but for me I look at luxury\nconsumption as an investment and a preservation of really important pieces of art.\" She adds: \"I hate to say it, but I don't think there's older money than dynastic money.\"\nWhen pushed, Christine is unsure what proportion of her in-laws' wealth is \"dynastically related\", but she knows they do \"very, very well\" in property. Why, then, does the family place so much emphasis on its links\nto the Song dynasty? Isn't it all a bit pretentious?\n\"I don't think anyone really cares about or traces dynasties and I try to downplay that,\" she says. \"But I also don't want to disrespect someone's heritage ? it's just being proud\nof where they are from. To me and my husband and our everyday life it has no relevance. What is a big deal is that my husband is a good father, an excellent surgeon and a beautiful human being.\"\nGabriel Chiu was born in Hong Kong and moved to the US as a child. He has a \"traditional\" family, very private and \"anything but boastful, you would never know they have so much money\", Christine says. The\ncouple met while working at a large medical corporation: he was a senior plastic surgeon, the \"star of the company\", and she was a vice-president of marketing.\n\"I thought there was a lot of untapped potential,\" she says. \"I was looking at him, thinking, this is a man who clearly cares about his craft and his work more than he cares about the profit, but I think in the right\nsetting we can really have it all. We can give patients the most elevated experience and he can be recognised for it.\"\nAfter their marriage in 2006 Christine decided to set up a plastic surgery practice, with herself as the managing director and Gabriel as lead surgeon. \"He was my first employee,\" she says. They launched their\nclinic using funds from Gabriel's family as well as money of their own. \"For a long time his family called it his very expensive hobby. They were very much on board, no expense was spared. The truth is, we didn't\nmake a profit [at the beginning] but it didn't matter because every morning he woke up and he was excited, approaching every patient like it was his canvas. I mean, he had a bottomless account to tap into to\nmake it the very best it can be and, in the journey of doing that, things caught fire and we grew.\"\nChristine herself comes from a \"very financially comfortable background\". Her parents were successful in business, moving from Taiwan to California when she was five. She struggled at school, speaking\nonly Mandarin at first. \"There was a class that taught Hispanic kids how to speak English, so I joined that,\" she says. She had to learn Spanish in order to learn English. \"I was very much made fun of. I've had my\nfair share of bullying. I went to three high schools and it wasn't easy.\"\nShe says her parents wanted to keep her grounded, emphasising the importance of having a job. \"My husband and I grew up in\naffluency, and both sides went out of their way to make sure we built a strong work ethic.\" She had a trust fund, but was cut offfrom it because she \"didn't do exactly what my parents wanted me to do at some\npoint\". She is guarded on this and won't say exactly why. That's all ancient history, however, as today the Chius' clinic is \"enormously profitable\". With more than 35,000 patients it's the go-to place for celebrities\nand the super-rich. She won't name names.\nCovid, she says, has caused a \"Zoom boom\" in plastic surgery. The more people are looking at their faces on a screen, the more treatments they want. \"People are putting the money they would have spent on a\nbig vacation back into their body. Before, they would chip away at their bucket list of things to get done, but during Covid\npeople are just getting it all done at once because they can recover at home and hide.\"\nThe clinic offers a \"mommy makeover\", which can include a breast lift, liposuction and tummy tuck. \"In many cases\", reads the website, \"women who have taken perfect care of their bodies feel trapped in their\nsagging or stretched skin as their self-confidence diminishes.\"\nThere is an argument, I suggest, that plastic surgeons reinforce people's insecurities rather than curing them. There is nothing more validating ? and crushing ? than someone in a white coat telling you that you\nhave bingo wings and a flat arse. \"There are a lot of surgeons who would just do it all ? take the money and just do it.\nWith Dr Chiu, he is definitely on the more natural side. He will talk people out of surgeries,\" she says.\nI ask about her own list of regular treatments. \"Ironically I'm very needlephobic,\" she admits. Her husband had to hire an anaesthesiologist to sedate her just\nso she could have Botox. Now, though, they have a machine\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
