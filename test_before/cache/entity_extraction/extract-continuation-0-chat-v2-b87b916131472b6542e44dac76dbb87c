Where are the police at?\" said sources.\nMuflihi told cops that he lunged because he didn't like the way the victim looked at him.\nInvestigators believe he was emotionally disturbed, sources said.\n\"How could they have exchanged looks?\" the victim's wife asked. \"It was too dark. He came up from behind and\nsaid nothing.\"\nThe victim - who police said was on his way home - stumbled and dropped to the sidewalk. Two passersby called\n911 and medics rushed him to Bellevue Hospital.\nHis wife said his condition was stable. The knife damaged vital organs including his liver and his right kidney,\nwhich had to be removed in surgery, sources said.\n\"This could happen to any of us. It could happen to you, your family, anyone,\" the victim's wife said. \"He's a\ngood man. He's an innocent person who was randomly attacked.\"\nMayor de Blasio condemned the attack during a Friday press briefing, pointing to a spike in hate crimes against\nAsian-Americans.\n\"Even as we're sounding the alarm and calling for people to band together to stop hate, we had a horrible\nincident yesterday, a horrible act of violence against an Asian-American man - out of nowhere, just pure\nhatred,\" de Blasio said.\n\"The suspect has been apprehended.
