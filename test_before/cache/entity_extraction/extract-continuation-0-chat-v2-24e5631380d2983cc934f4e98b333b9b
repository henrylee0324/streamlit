But those hard times don't compare to the months of dwindling business the neighborhood is experiencing from the\ncoronavirus pandemic.\nChinatown small businesses report losses of 60% to 80% as early as February from a decline of customers that happened\nbefore New York City's first confirmed COVID-19 case and the city's mandatory lockdown in March.\n\"Since there is a misunderstanding that the virus was brought to the US from China, a lot of people did not want to be in or\naround Chinatown, or even eat Chinese food,\" said Chuen Ping Hui, owner and executive chef of Ping's seafood restaurant.\nWhile New York recently lifted its restrictions on outdoor dining, Chinatown restaurants are still contending with a lack of\nvisitors.\n\"New York City now, it's quite clear that we no longer have the 66 million visitors from international tourism,\" said Wellington\nChen, executive director of Chinatown Partnership.\nThe organization helps maintain cleanliness and safety in the neighborhood, which are more necessary than ever.\n\"The demand on you is higher because of the additional cost of the shield, the masks, the sanitizers, the air filtration, HEPA\nequipment that has never been in your formula,\" Chen said. \"And that's never in your budget, but meantime, your customers\nare down this much.\"\nTo attract customers, the nonprofit Chinatown Partnership has been helping Ping's and other local businesses set up outdoor\nseating arrangements for the summer, in the form of collapsible tents, tables, chairs, and planters.\nPing's is one of the area's small businesses that operates on thin profit margins and relies on a steady stream of both locals\nand tourists. When that stream dropped off in mid-March, Hui made a tough decision.\n\"Once March 15 came around, the business for March was down by 80%. I did not see a future,\" Hui said. \"Chinatown was\nquiet. I had no choice but to [temporarily] close the business.\"\nAfter a three-month closure, Ping's reopened in early June with delivery and takeout service only. But the setup was less than\nideal for a fine-dining restaurant accustomed to serving as many as 150 people indoors. The restaurant added a small outdoor\nspace in late June, but it only fits around 20 diners, and it's often empty on weekdays.\nAmid the pandemic and an economic downturn, Asian Americans are fighting racism and a stigma that they're to blame for the\nvirus.\nIn March, the FBI warned of a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans. And since March 19, the website Stop AAPI Hate\nhas received 2,373 anonymous incident reports of hate and discrimination toward Asians in the US.\nThe Stop AAPI Hate reporting center found that verbal harassment makes up 70% to 80% of the incidents and there's been a\nrise in physical incidents, such as spitting or coughing on Asian people.\n\"We shifted really quickly from being 'crazy rich Asians' and the 'model minority' to being 'crazy infected Asians' and being the\nperpetual foreigner,\" said Russell Jeung, founder of Stop AAPI Hate and chair of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State\nUniversity.\nAs Chinatown suffers, hate crimes against Asians are rising in the US.\nPresident Donald Trump has reinforced the harmful racial stigma by saying \"Kung flu\" and \"China virus\" when referring to\nCOVID-19.\n\"The president's insistence on using the term 'Chinese virus' really makes the situation worse,\" Jeung said. \"We noticed that\nafter he began to repeatedly use that term, a clear spike in hate speech circulating on the internet and acts of violence against\nAsian Americans.\"\nChen, the Chinatown Partnership and Chinatown BID director, said the attacks threaten not just Chinese people, but all Asians.\n\"Unfortunately you have a ripple effect affecting Malaysians, Singaporeans, Vietnamese, people from the Philippines,\" he said.\n\"As long as you have an Asian face, you then become associated with this virus.\"\nThe stigma has been detrimental to Asian American small businesses: 233,000 have closed across the country from February\nto April, a loss of 28%.\nTo support small businesses in their neighborhood, Victoria Lee and Jennifer Tam started the grassroots organization Welcome\nto Chinatown in March. The organization has several initiatives, including a partnership with small businesses to create and sell\nmerchandise, with revenue going directly back to the businesses.\n\"Chinatown doesn't need saving in the sense that there's an impassioned community,\" Lee said. \"We're only one of a handful\nof different grassroots initiatives that have come out of the pandemic.\"\nOne of its early fundraisers, Feed Our Heroes, involved purchasing meals from local eateries and delivering them to essential\nworkers. The group has served more than 16,000 meals in 11 weeks.\nTo extend assistance beyond food-related businesses, Welcome to Chinatown ended that program in June and recently\nlaunched the Longevity Fund, a $200,000 fundraiser to alleviate overhead costs for 40 small local businesses.\n\"It's just really hard to see a time and place where Chinatown isn't where it was before in a post-COVID world,\" Tam said.\nIn the meantime, Chen is encouraging people to visit the neighborhood.\n\"Please come down\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MANHATTAN<|>GEO<|>Manhattan is a borough of New York City, known for its vibrant neighborhoods, including Chinatown, which has been affected by the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in Manhattan that has been struggling due to COVID-19 restrictions and racial stigma against Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PING'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ping's is a seafood restaurant in Chinatown, owned by Chuen Ping Hui, which has faced significant losses due to the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN PARTNERSHIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chinatown Partnership is a nonprofit organization that helps maintain cleanliness and safety in Chinatown and supports local businesses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WELCOME TO CHINATOWN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Welcome to Chinatown is a grassroots organization started to support small businesses in Chinatown during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>PERSON<|>Russell Jeung is the founder of Stop AAPI Hate and a chair of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University, advocating against anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that tracks incidents of hate and discrimination against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICTORIA LEE<|>PERSON<|>Victoria Lee is one of the founders of the grassroots organization Welcome to Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENNIFER TAM<|>PERSON<|>Jennifer Tam is one of the founders of the grassroots organization Welcome to Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States, whose rhetoric has been criticized for exacerbating racial stigma against Asians during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PING'S<|>CHINATOWN<|>Ping's is a seafood restaurant located in Chinatown, which has been struggling due to the neighborhood's economic downturn<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINATOWN PARTNERSHIP<|>PING'S<|>Chinatown Partnership is helping Ping's and other local businesses set up outdoor dining arrangements to attract customers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WELCOME TO CHINATOWN<|>CHINATOWN<|>Welcome to Chinatown is a grassroots organization aimed at supporting small businesses in Chinatown during the pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Russell Jeung is the founder of Stop AAPI Hate, which addresses hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTORIA LEE<|>WELCOME TO CHINATOWN<|>Victoria Lee is a co-founder of the grassroots organization Welcome to Chinatown, which supports local businesses<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JENNIFER TAM<|>WELCOME TO CHINATOWN<|>Jennifer Tam is a co-founder of the grassroots organization Welcome to Chinatown, which supports local businesses<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric has been linked to a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, which Russell Jeung is actively working to combat<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINATOWN PARTNERSHIP<|>CHINATOWN<|>Chinatown Partnership works to maintain cleanliness and safety in Chinatown, which is crucial for the neighborhood's recovery<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
