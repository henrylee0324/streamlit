The suggested resolution she read aloud drew support from several council members.\nBut City Manager Doug Krieger said, instead of adopting a resolution or proclamation, the city plans to roll out a broader diversity and inclusion plan that has been in the works for several months.\nWork toward the plan began after two high-profile episodes of unrest last fall, one involving a multiracial group of 18 asked to move at Buffalo Wild Wings because staffers said two white customers did not want to sit by them, and another involving a 14-year-old white student who posted an ad online showing a photo of a black classmate with the words \"Slave for Sale (NAPERVILLE).\"\nThe city in December updated its mission statement to include a focus on \"creating an inclusive community that values diversity.\" Krieger said a future diversity plan will include recommendations related to the staff members and partner organizations, taking into account feedback received from the U.S. Department of Justice. The plan is expected to come before the council May 19.\nThe plan could help address concerns raised by Chen and Liu, who said some recent actions have served to divide the city.\nChen said a Chinese American man jogging on a trail March 21 \"was physically attacked by two women who spit on him and yelled at him to go back to China.\"\nNaperville Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of up to $1,000 for information that leads to an arrest in the case. Police are investigating.\nA few weeks later, comments submitted by Erika DeCarlo during the city’s first virtual council meeting called Asian members of an Opt Out group advocating against recreational marijuana sales \"roving carpetbaggers\" and made remarks Chen and Liu said they found hurtful.\n\"I cannot disagree more with Ms. DeCarlo’s depiction of many Naperville citizens of Chinese descent who support the Opt Out as carpetbaggers,\" Liu said. \"The portrayal was demeaning and highly offensive.\"\nCouncil members echoed Chen’s and Liu’s denouncement of the remarks, with everyone on the panel saying there is no place in Naperville and no place in public discourse for such statements.\nCouncil member Benny White said he is meeting with Krieger later this week to discuss steps toward a potential commission or other framework to address race-related issues. He also has been hosting a series of Naperville Neighbors United meetings to promote dialogue around race and inclusion.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
