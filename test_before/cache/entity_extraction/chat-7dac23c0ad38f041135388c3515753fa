We are getting spat on, shoved, punched,\nslashed, stabbed,\" said Jo-Ann Yoo of the Asian American Federation. \"Right now Asian-Americans are scared,\nwe are outraged, and we are devastated.\"\nMayoral candidate Andrew Yang, one of the nation's best-known Asian politicians, attended the rally but was not\ngiven a speaking spot and left without speaking to reporters.\nThe crowd gave a rousing reception to Noel Quintana, 61, a Filipino-American who was slashed in the face on\nthe L train last week. \"A lot of Asian-Americans [are] being attacked everywhere so I just want [people] to know\nthat this is happening to us,\" he said. \"Almost every day there are attacks and I don't understand why.\"\nMany New Yorkers were stunned to see a viral video of an Asian-American woman being slammed to the\nsidewalk last week in an unprovoked attack in Flushing, Queens.\nRep. Grace Meng (D-Queens) said the attacks are the tip of an iceberg of hate crimes, many of which go\nunreported.\nShe vowed that Asian-Americans would no longer settle for being \"invisible\" victims.\n\"Too many people who are afraid to leave their homes,\" said Meng, whose district includes Flushing, \"not just\nbecause of the virus, but because of bigotry.\"\nAsian-American leaders say they are regularly targeted for verbal and physical abuse by people who blame them\nfor the pandemic.\nMany blame the racist violence in part on former President Donald Trump, who often called COVID-19 the \"China\nvirus\" or other racist terms because it was first identified in China.\nMayor de Blasio, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and state Attorney General Letitia James all vowed to crack down\non anti-Asian violence in New York, saying the city needs to protect people targeted by hatred.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
