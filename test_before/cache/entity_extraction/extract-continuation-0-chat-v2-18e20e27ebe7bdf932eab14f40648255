Low-wage earners, service workers, informal workers, and workers in the gig economy are among those least likely to have paid sick leave. The lack of paid sick and family leave means disease outbreaks like COVID-19 place an undue burden on poor and marginalized workers and exacerbate economic inequality and also contribute to gender inequity. To support families during the outbreak, sick and family leave should cover self-isolation and caregiving responsibilities during school and care facility closures.\nGlobal supply chains have already been disrupted by COVID-19, which has led to reduced manufacturing and factory closures. There is a risk that workers in jobs linked to the global economy will be forced to work part-time for less income or lose their jobs altogether.\nOne option is direct cash payments to compensate some lost working hours, as was provided by the US government during the 2008 recession. Low- wage workers need protection against the consequences of being let go by employers when they cannot work due to their sickness or the sickness of family members. Without assistance, these workers may face intense economic hardship, fall behind on debt payments, and risk eviction. Simple one-off cash grants to families whose children receive free school meals or who are in receipt of specific family-related social security assistance could also help mitigate impacts on already-struggling families who now in addition to loss of income could face extra burdens, for example, due to school closures. European countries, including Italy, France, and Spain, are considering or already adopted special financial measures to support workers, low-income families, and small businesses.\nUnconditional tax cuts for employers and employee-side payroll tax cuts are often poorly targeted and may not reach those most in need. For example, expanded social insurance programs like unemployment may permit workers to stay on payroll and be paid when they cannot work because of a COVID- 19 downturn.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has led to significant economic and social challenges, including the lack of paid sick leave for workers and increased economic inequality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US GOVERNMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The US government provided direct cash payments during the 2008 recession to support workers affected by economic downturns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>European countries, including Italy, France, and Spain, are considering or have adopted financial measures to support workers and families during economic hardships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALY<|>GEO<|>Italy is one of the European countries considering special financial measures to support low-income families and small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>France is one of the European countries considering special financial measures to support low-income families and small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPAIN<|>GEO<|>Spain is one of the European countries considering special financial measures to support low-income families and small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>US GOVERNMENT<|>The US government provided financial assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic similar to actions taken during the 2008 recession<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES<|>European countries are implementing financial measures in response to the economic impact of COVID-19<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES<|>ITALY<|>Italy is part of the European countries considering financial measures to support families during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES<|>FRANCE<|>France is part of the European countries considering financial measures to support families during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES<|>SPAIN<|>Spain is part of the European countries considering financial measures to support families during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
