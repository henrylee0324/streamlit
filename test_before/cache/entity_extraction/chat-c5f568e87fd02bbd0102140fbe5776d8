For months, the medical examiner listed his cause of death as \"pending.\"\nTheir lives had no obvious overlap, and they occupied different social strata. Dowd was a manager at a\nsemiconductor company that required regular international travel, though she hadn't been overseas recently.\nRivera was a security guard, who in recent employment at a hotel earned $14 an hour.\nNeither was administered a blood test for COVID-19, and officially, there was no chance their deaths were related\nto the virus. That's because Santa Clara County's top health officials were unequivocal at the time in declaring that\nthe virus was not spreading there.\nAt a public meeting Feb. 19, the county's public health chief, Sara Cody, said there was no reason for residents to\nwear masks, cancel gatherings or seek testing for the virus if they were showing symptoms.\nCody said the county had only two confirmed cases, and both were travelers from Wuhan who had been ordered\nto isolate.\n\"If somebody's not had travel to mainland China, we don't consider them a risk for COVID-19 and don't test,\"\nsaid Cody, who projected a message reading:\n. On the day of Dowd's death, there was a single novel coronavirus test administered in all of Santa Clara\nCounty, according to county data. On the date of Rivera's death, there were two tests. The county didn't top\n1,000 tests a day until late April.\nIt wasn't until April 22 that the veil was partially lifted on what had been missed months earlier. Chief health\nofficer Cody held a press conference announcing that posthumous tests had revealed that three deaths months\nearlier – those of Dowd, Rivera and a 70-year-old Filipino man named Rolando Olaguer – were actually due to\nCOVID-19.\nCody called them \"iceberg tips\" of an unseen outbreak. Dowd became the earliest confirmed casualty of the\nvirus in the United States, pre-dating a Seattle-area death on Feb. 28.\nFor county executive Smith, the revelation of early COVID-19 deaths made for a painful confirmation that his\ncounty's policies had allowed residents to unknowingly infect and kill each other. He said his greatest regret was\ntrusting the CDC's guidance that there was no need for testing unless a person had symptoms and recent travel\nto Wuhan. Similar frustrations were expressed by health officials around the U.S. who felt the CDC, previously\nconsidered the world's premier health agency, had failed the country due to egregious missteps and\nmisinformation.\n\"I firmly believe that if the federal government had dealt with this appropriately, that many, many hundreds of\nthousands of Americans would not have died,\" Smith said.\nHe's thought back to those conversations with his wife in December, during which she told him about patients\nwho had flu-like symptoms but tested negative for the flu. (Smith's wife, who works for a private corporation,\ndeclined to be interviewed, citing medical privacy concerns.)\nHe now suspects that those patients had COVID-19, and that the virus has been circulating in his county since\nDecember. It's a theory supported by academic research suggesting that the virus was in the U.S. then,\nincluding a UCLA study that revealed a major spike in patients with coughs and acute respiratory failure in the\nfinal month of 2019.\n***\nAt the same time COVID-19 was spreading unseen through northern California, it was gaining a similar foothold\nin other regions throughout the country.For Sevil Dungill in Chicago, his family's battle – and to an extent his city's – with the virus began with thin-\ncrust pizza and embraces of condolence from an old family friend.It was Feb. 28, the night before the celebration of Dungill's late sister, and the friend brought him a pie from\nHome Run Inn.\nThey sat close together and, as they reached for slices of pizza, they lingered on everything but the novel\ncoronavirus. Following the deaths of Dungill's sister and mother, the friend seemed to understand he could use a\nfew-hour respite from talk of sickness.\nDungill's friend wasn't married and had no children. Instead he filled his life with extended families: his own,\nand those of which he was an honorary member. Every Thanksgiving he stopped by to visit the Dungills, and he\ncalled Sevil's elderly parents on their birthdays every year.\nDungill's friend had recently had a little scare with the virus. He had briefly lost his senses of taste and smell.\nThe friend, who USA TODAY is not naming because he declined to be interviewed, had been golfing in Arizona, where there were a handful of confirmed cases.\nHe knew the loss of those senses was a symptom. But his doctor prescribed him a steroid and assured him it\nwas just his asthma acting up.\nBy the time Dungill's\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
