Encouraged by his grandmother and teachers, Sriratana pursued his studies and graduated with a master's degree in architecture from Columbia University. He is now a partner and managing director of a New York-based architectural firm.\n\"The mentoring gives children an opportunity to ask questions they can't ask their parents, or if their parents don't know the system. This relationship is so important,\" he says.\nIn 2001, he mentored a 12-year-old boy who grew up in New York's Chinatown and had never been to Central Park. Another boy he mentored almost dropped out of school, but eventually became an architect like him. The boy's best friend - also helped by Apex - has become a nurse and is now working on the Covid-19 front line.\n\"We don't push them to be doctors and lawyers. We want to instil in them the three Cs: Confidence, College-ready and Come back and give to the community,\" Sriratana says. \"It's not just about schooling, but being well-rounded. We want to see more Asian-Americans in leadership positions across different sectors.\"\nAndrew Yang, a contender for the US Democratic Party presidential nomination until he bowed out in favour of Joe Biden, is a long-time Apex supporter. Like actress Gemma Chan, Carol Lim and Humberto Leon of fashion label Opening Ceremony, and singer-songwriter Jhené Aiko, he has been honoured with an award from the organisation.\nApex's annual fundraising gala has been postponed to September, when the it plans to honour actress Lana Condor, who starred in To All the Boys I've Loved Before on Netflix, and Amanda Nguyen, founder and CEO of Rise, a non-profit organisation that fights for the civil rights of victims of sexual violence.\nJason was one of the speakers at last year's gala, and Chung says the teenager spent a long time working on his speech. He talked about the racism he faced growing up, and recalled an incident at a railway station when a stranger shouted a racist slur at him and his mother.\n\"I asked my mum why she didn't say anything,\" Jason recalls. \"Our generation should speak up. Our parents came here to provide a better opportunity for us, so they never think to speak up. But we should defend ourselves.\"\nJason's mother was in the audience, and at the end of the speech he thanked her for the sacrifices she made to bring him to the US. Tears streamed down her cheeks.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NORMAL<|>GEO<|>Normal is a city in Illinois where Sriratana faced bullying and struggled at school.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Columbia University is an Ivy League university in New York where Sriratana graduated with a master's degree in architecture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SRIRATANA<|>PERSON<|>Sriratana is a partner and managing director of a New York-based architectural firm who mentors children and advocates for Asian-American representation in leadership.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APEX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apex is an organization that provides mentoring to children, helping them to become well-rounded individuals and instilling confidence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDREW YANG<|>PERSON<|>Andrew Yang is a former contender for the US Democratic Party presidential nomination and a long-time supporter of Apex.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEMMA CHAN<|>PERSON<|>Gemma Chan is an actress and supporter of Apex who has been honored with an award from the organization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAROL LIM<|>PERSON<|>Carol Lim is a fashion designer and supporter of Apex who has been honored with an award from the organization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMBERTO LEON<|>PERSON<|>Humberto Leon is a fashion designer and supporter of Apex who has been honored with an award from the organization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JHENÉ AIKO<|>PERSON<|>Jhené Aiko is a singer-songwriter and supporter of Apex who has been honored with an award from the organization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LANA CONDOR<|>PERSON<|>Lana Condor is an actress who starred in \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\" and is set to be honored at Apex's annual fundraising gala.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMANDA NGUYEN<|>PERSON<|>Amanda Nguyen is the founder and CEO of Rise, a non-profit organization that fights for the civil rights of victims of sexual violence, and is set to be honored at Apex's gala.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 FRONT LINE<|>EVENT<|>The Covid-19 front line refers to the efforts of healthcare workers, including those mentored by Apex, during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNUAL FUNDRAISING GALA<|>EVENT<|>Apex's annual fundraising gala is an event where the organization honors individuals for their contributions and support.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SRIRATANA<|>APEX<|>Sriratana is a mentor through Apex, helping children and advocating for their development<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDREW YANG<|>APEX<|>Andrew Yang is a long-time supporter of Apex and has been involved with the organization<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEMMA CHAN<|>APEX<|>Gemma Chan has been honored with an award from Apex for her support<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAROL LIM<|>APEX<|>Carol Lim has been honored with an award from Apex for her support<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMBERTO LEON<|>APEX<|>Humberto Leon has been honored with an award from Apex for his support<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHENÉ AIKO<|>APEX<|>Jhené Aiko has been honored with an award from Apex for her support<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LANA CONDOR<|>ANNUAL FUNDRAISING GALA<|>Lana Condor is set to be honored at Apex's annual fundraising gala<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMANDA NGUYEN<|>ANNUAL FUNDRAISING GALA<|>Amanda Nguyen is set to be honored at Apex's annual fundraising gala<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APEX<|>COVID-19 FRONT LINE<|>Apex supports individuals who are working on the Covid-19 front line, including those they mentor<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
