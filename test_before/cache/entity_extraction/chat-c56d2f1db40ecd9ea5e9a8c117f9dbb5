In the 12 hours after Trump's announcement, ADL saw an 85 percent spike in such language.\nThe announcement sparked thousands of online conversations blaming China for trying to purposefully infect the\npresident, the researchers found.\nFor example, in one since-deleted tweet to her 394,000 followers, pro-Trump former congressional candidate\nDeAnna Lorraine said that \"China must pay for giving Trump COVID\" and swore that \"we will have justice.\"\nAnother Twitter user with 114,000 followers blamed Chinese President Xi Jinping for trying to assassinate\nTrump.\nThe anti-China rhetoric used by the Trump administration and its supporters throughout the pandemic has left\nAsian Americans vulnerable to racist attacks, researchers have previously found. Fear, hatred and\nmisinformation online has led to verbal assaults, boycotts of Asian businesses and sometimes violence. A\ncoalition of Asian American groups, along with San Francisco State University, reported this summer that 2,120\nhate incidents against Asian Americans have taken place since March.\nPresident Trump has been at the forefront of pushing a narrative that responsibility for the virus lies with China.\nIn the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, Trump said the covid-19 crisis was \"China's fault\" and referred to\nthe virus as the \"China plague.\"\n\"From the birther scandal to lies about immigrants to his attempt to blame China for his own failure to contain\nthe coronavirus, Donald Trump has built his presidency on perpetuating conspiracy theories and racism,\" Rep.\nJudy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said in a statement.\nShe warned that rhetoric in reaction to the president's followers blaming Asians or Jews for problems can lead to\nviolence.\nThey \"not only doubled down on the use of slurs like 'Chinese virus' and 'Kung flu,' they also denied the impact\ntheir own words were having on innocent Asian Americans who have been terrified by the anti-Asian hate we\nhave witnessed throughout this pandemic,\" Chu said.\nThe ADL conducted its research by collecting tweets containing the keywords \"trump,\" \"melania\" and \"first lady,\"\npairing them with the terms \"china virus,\" \"plague,\" \"kung flu\" or \"Wuhan.\" It also included mentions of\n@realdonaldtrump, @potus and @flotus. The civil rights group used those parameters to collect conversations\nspecifically tied to Trump's diagnosis.\nThey then compared the volume of mentions in the three days following Trump's Oct. 2 tweet announcing his\ndiagnosis, and compared it with a baseline of data collected from five hours before the diagnosis.\nWhile the ADL did not cull through all 2.7 million tweets, its researchers analyzed the results from numerous\nTwitter users with large followings to observe the sentiment associated with the keywords.\nSeparately, the group also detected a rise in conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic comments following the\npresident's diagnosis.\nOne of the most common conspiracy theories is that a \"New World Order\" or \"NWO\" will surface run by secretive\nactors who either gave Trump the virus or plan to assassinate him during his illness, the report said. Other\ntweets made anti-Semitic claims such as Trump is a \"crypto Jew\" or a Zionist agent, or that he is a pawn subject\nto Jewish interests.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
