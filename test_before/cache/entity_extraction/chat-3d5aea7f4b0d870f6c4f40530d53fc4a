How do people treat her?' A lot of mothers and fathers are being targeted around the country.\"\nLast week eight people – most of them women of Asian descent – were killed in three shootings at Atlanta-area spas before police arrested a 21-year-old man suspected of being the gunman.\nTeigen added that \"it's so obvious\" to her what the motive is in these types of attacks.\n\"It doesn't seem to be obvious to the politicians out there that are saying 'We're not quite sure of the motive' but I think we know what it is\" she added.\nI'm 'afraid to leave my house': Asian women are living in fear\nShe also encouraged others to take action but not through \"performative activism.\"\n\"If people can just reach out in any way to support the Asian-American community AAPI in general\" Teigen said. \"There's Stop AAPI Hate which is a wonderful organization to donate to and an organization called 18 Million Rising is really incredible.\" \nShe also encouraged people to support Asian-owned businesses in their communities.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic businesses especially struggled amid fears of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States including restaurants in Chinatown neighborhoods across the country.\n\"These things are disappearing quicker than we know it and soon they're going to be gone and it's heartbreaking to me\" she said.\nChrissy Teigen abruptly quits Twitter. 6 signs you need to unplug and ditch social media\nTeigen has long been vocal on issues that matter to her but one place her voice will no longer be heard is Twitter.\nThe star made headlines recently for walking away from social media site.
