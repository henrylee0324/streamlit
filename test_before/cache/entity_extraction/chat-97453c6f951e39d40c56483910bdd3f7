A Chinatown social worker at the nonprofit NICOS Chinese Health Coalition, Lee said his team has spent the pandemic trying to make members of the Asian American community feel less alienated.But he concedes their efforts have fallen short. Elders frequently ask him if the pandemic is an omen of doom, a question no one can answer to any degree of satisfaction.“No one seems to care about us,” said Lee, 62.When anti-Asian violence increases, so does neglect, experts saySan Francisco’s Shanti Project, a revered nonprofit founded in the 1970s to help dying AIDS patients, expanded its services to Asian American residents of Chinatown this spring. Volunteers and staff distribute food and offer telehealth support, senior services and emergency supplies.Even before the pandemic, members of these tight-knit immigrant communities were familiar with the feeling of being neglected and overlooked. Because of this, many Asian Americans in San Francisco now cope with the belief that asking for help, whether it’s from a doctor or other service provider, is futile.Dr. Tung Nguyen, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said the pandemic has only heightened this feeling of helplessness.Nguyen pointed out that Asian Americans are the least likely of any racial group to use health and social services. Public health officials aren’t sure whether the low usage rate is due to barriers caused by language, culture, immigration status or a general mistrust of government proposals.Nguyen also co-authored a report released in May by the Asian American Research Center on Health that called attention to the fact that 50% of San Francisco’s 31 COVID-19 deaths at that time were among Asian Americans. It was a disproportionately high percentage since Asian Americans make up just over a third of the city’s population.Although the percentage of deaths has since dropped, Nguyen said a lack of detailed data about Asian Americans often means that city funds aren’t allocated to this group.“The truth is we are the ones who lose out as a result of this stereotype,” he added.To be sure, the fortunes and contributions of many Asian Americans have skyrocketed in past decades. The median annual income of households headed by the nation’s 22 million Asian Americans is $73,060, compared with $53,600 for all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center.But these success stories obscure the troubling reality facing many Asian Americans.“You simply cannot look at Asian Americans as a monolithic group because if you do that, you’re going to miss how different communities experience the pandemic,” said Jarvis Chen, a lecturer in social and behavioral sciences at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Massachusetts.A closer look at San Francisco's two dozen Asian ethnicities reveals many groups within this broad categorization are struggling financially and remain outside the mainstream. About 43% are non-English speakers, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. census data. About a third of San Franciscans are foreign-born, and 13% are not U.S. citizens.Discrimination also is keeping some Asian Americans from getting tested for COVID-19. The website Stop AAPI Hate, the acronym for Asian American Pacific Islander, has logged more than 2,500 incidents of discrimination across the U.S. since mid-March. The attacks have ranged from verbal assaults to acts of physical violence.When Asian Americans hear President Donald Trump, who contracted COVID-19 in October, repeatedly call the virus the “China virus” and “Kung Flu,” “it makes them less likely to seek help, a bit like early in the AIDS epidemic when the gay community was stigmatized,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, professor of public policy at the University of California, Riverside, and chair of the California Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander American Affairs. “We fear many Asian American families have gone underground.”Decades of racist policies have limited Asian American’s standard of livingChinese citizens began passing through San Francisco’s then bridgeless Golden Gate en masse during the Gold Rush of 1849. By 1851, some 25,000 had arrived, lured by the hope of riches in a land called Gum Saan in Cantonese, or “gold mountain.”By the late 1800s, the Chinese were not just vilified but outright barred from entering the country, with few exceptions, by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. White officials charged they were taking jobs from other Americans, despite having been integral to the Gold Rush’s boom and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad.At the height of World War II, Japanese Americans around the country were rounded up and sent to internment camps, feared as the traitorous “yellow peril” after years of citizenship. Despite painful and humiliating treatment at the hands of the U.S. government, many Asians resolved to engrain themselves in the society at large with an image of themselves as patriotic, hardworking Americans. Japanese Americans were among the most decorated U.S. soldiers during the war, and others excelled in academics and commerce.The model minority image gained momentum during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Asian American success stories were highlighted by white U.S. officials both as a way of signaling to other nations, namely the Soviet Union, that America was not racist, but also to shame other ethnic groups, notably Black Americans.The logic went that if Asian Americans were doing so well, surely failure on the part of other ethnic groups was their own fault.Then came the Vietnam War, a quagmire that resulted in a U.S.-sponsored evacuation of 125,000 refugees followed by countless others who escaped Southeast Asia in rickety boats. Many landed in San Francisco.“The stereotype about us is broad and includes the notion that we’re all studious, we don’t\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
