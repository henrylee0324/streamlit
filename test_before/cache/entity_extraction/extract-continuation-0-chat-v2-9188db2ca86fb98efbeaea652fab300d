Human Rights Concerns Protect freedom of expression and ensure access to critical information\nUnder international human rights law, governments have an obligation to protect the right to freedom of expression, including the right to seek, receive, and impart information of all kinds, regardless of frontiers. Permissible restrictions on freedom of expression for reasons of public health, noted above, may not put in jeopardy the right itself.\nGovernments are responsible for providing information necessary for the protection and promotion of rights, including the right to health. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards as a core obligation providing education and access to information concerning the main health problems in the community, including methods of preventing and controlling them. A rights-respecting response to COVID-19 needs to ensure that accurate and up-to-date information about the virus, access to services, service disruptions, and other aspects of the response to the outbreak is readily available and accessible to all.\nIn a number of countries, governments have failed to uphold the right to freedom of expression, taking actions against journalists and healthcare workers. This ultimately limited effective communication about the onset of the disease and undermined trust in government actions:\nChina's government initially withheld basic information about the coronavirus from the public, underreported cases of infection, downplayed the severity of the infection, and dismissed the likelihood of transmission between humans. Authorities detained people for reporting on the epidemic on social media and internet users for rumor-mongering, censored online discussions of the epidemic, and curbed media reporting. In early January, Li Wenliang, a doctor at a hospital in Wuhan where infected patients were being treated, was summoned by police for spreading rumors after he warned of the new virus in an online chatroom. He died in early February from the virus.\nIn Iran, the outbreak emerged after authorities had severely damaged public trust by brutally repressing widespread anti-government protests and lying about shooting down a civilian airliner. As a result, Iranian authorities have struggled to assure the public that government decision-making around the COVID-19 outbreak has been in the public's best interests. The unusually high rate of reported cases of government officials contracting the virus, as well as the inconsistency in figures announced by officials and domestic media sources, have heightened concerns that the data is either being deliberately underreported or poorly collected and analyzed.\nIn Thailand, whistleblowers in the public health sector and online journalists have faced retaliatory lawsuits and intimidation from authorities after they criticized government responses to the outbreak, raised concerns about a possible cover-up, and reported alleged corruption related to the hoarding and profiteering of surgical masks and other supplies. Some medical personnel were also threatened with disciplinary action - including termination of employment contracts and revocation of their licenses - for speaking out about the severe shortage of essential supplies in hospitals across the country.\nA few countries prioritized open communication and transparent reporting on the number of cases:\nTaiwan took swift steps to combat the virus, including promptly making credible information widely available to the public. Daily press briefings by health officials and public service announcements aim to counter misinformation and have helped to calm panic, restore public confidence, and encourage people's assistance in the crisis.\nSingapore's government published and regularly updated detailed statistics on the number and rate of infections and recoveries.\nSouth Korea's government also published health data and health officials gave two daily briefings to establish public confidence and promote citizen vigilance.\nIn Italy, inconsistent messages from public officials, including for domestic political reasons, may initially have diluted the impact of public service announcements about proper hygiene and social distancing. The government has held daily news conferences to share data and implemented an aggressive public campaign about better practices to protect oneself and others from spreading the virus.\nRecommendations:\nGovernments should fully respect the rights to freedom of expression and access to information, and only restrict them as international standards permit.\nGovernments should ensure that the information they provide to the public regarding COVID-19 is accurate, timely, and consistent with human rights principles. This is important for addressing false and misleading information.\nAll information about COVID-19 should be accessible and available in multiple languages, including for those with low or no literacy. This should include qualified sign language interpretation for televised announcements, as Taiwan has done; websites that are accessible to people with vision, hearing, learning, and other disabilities; and telephone-based services that have text capabilities for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Communications should utilize plain language to maximize understanding. Age appropriate information should be provided to children to help them take steps to protect themselves.\nHealth data is particularly sensitive, and the publication of information online can pose a significant risk to affected persons and in particular people who are already in positions of vulnerability or marginalization in society. Rights-based legal safeguards should govern the appropriate use and handling of personal health data.\nReliable and unfettered access to the internet should be maintained and steps should be taken to ensure internet access be available to people with low incomes. The US Federal Communications Commission's Keep Americans Connected pledge commits participating companies not to terminate service to customers who are unable to pay their bills due to the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, to waive any late fees, and to open Wi-Fi hotspots to any American who needs them. Further steps could be taken to lift data caps, upgrade speeds, and eliminate eligibility requirements for any low-income targeted plans during the pandemic.\nEnsure quarantines, lockdowns, and travel bans comply with rights norms\nInternational human rights law, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), requires that restrictions on rights for reasons of public health or national emergency be lawful, necessary, and proportionate. Restrictions such as mandatory quarantine or isolation of symptomatic people must, at a minimum, be carried out in accordance with the law. They must be strictly necessary to achieve a legitimate objective, based on scientific evidence, proportionate to achieve that objective, neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application, of limited duration, respectful of human dignity, and subject to review.\nBroad\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Human Rights Concerns is an organization focused on protecting freedom of expression and ensuring access to critical information under international human rights law.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LI WENLIANG<|>PERSON<|>Li Wenliang was a doctor in Wuhan who warned about the new virus and was later detained by police for spreading rumors; he died from the virus in February.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country where the government initially withheld information about the coronavirus and took actions against journalists.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IRAN<|>GEO<|>Iran is a country that struggled to assure the public about government decision-making during the COVID-19 outbreak due to a lack of trust.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THAILAND<|>GEO<|>Thailand is a country where whistleblowers and journalists faced retaliation for criticizing government responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAIWAN<|>GEO<|>Taiwan is a country that took swift steps to combat the virus by making credible information widely available to the public.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>GEO<|>Singapore is a country that published and regularly updated detailed statistics on COVID-19 infections and recoveries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH KOREA<|>GEO<|>South Korea is a country that published health data and held daily briefings to promote public confidence during the COVID-19 outbreak.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALY<|>GEO<|>Italy is a country that faced inconsistent messages from public officials regarding COVID-19, impacting public service announcements.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LI WENLIANG<|>CHINA<|>Li Wenliang was a doctor in China who faced government action for warning about the coronavirus<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS<|>Human Rights Concerns highlights the actions of the Chinese government against freedom of expression during the COVID-19 outbreak<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IRAN<|>HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS<|>Human Rights Concerns discusses the lack of public trust in Iran's government during the COVID-19 outbreak<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THAILAND<|>HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS<|>Human Rights Concerns mentions retaliatory actions against whistleblowers and journalists in Thailand<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAIWAN<|>HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS<|>Human Rights Concerns praises Taiwan for its transparent communication during the COVID-19 outbreak<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS<|>Human Rights Concerns notes Singapore's efforts in providing updated statistics on COVID-19<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH KOREA<|>HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS<|>Human Rights Concerns highlights South Korea's daily briefings to establish public confidence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITALY<|>HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS<|>Human Rights Concerns discusses the impact of inconsistent messages from Italian officials on public health communication<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
