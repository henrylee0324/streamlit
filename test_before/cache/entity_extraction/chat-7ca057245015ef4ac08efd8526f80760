But the anesthesiology resident at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital cannot erase the memory of what happened after work at the start of the pandemic.\nA man followed the Chinese American doctor from the Boston hospital, spewing a profanity-laced racist tirade as she walked to the subway. \"Why are you Chinese people killing\neveryone?\" Li recalled the man shouting. \"What is wrong with you? Why the f--- are you killing us?\"\nStunned at first, then relieved she was not physically attacked, Li is now saddened and angered by the irony that she spends her days and nights helping to save lives. Her work\ninserting tubes in patients' airways has grown riskier since the coronavirus emerged - each procedure releasing droplets and secretions that could carry viral particles.\n\"I'm risking my own personal health, and then to be vilified just because of what I look like,\" said Li, 28, who is wary that one of her patients, too, could harbor such prejudices.\n\"I try not to think about that possibility when I'm at work taking care of patients. But it's always there, at the very back of my mind.\"\nAcross the country, Asian American health-care workers have reported a rise in incidents of bigotry. The racial hostility has left Asian Americans, who represent 6 percent of the\nU.S. population but 18 percent of the country's physicians and 10 percent of its nurse practitioners, in a painful position on the front lines of the response to the coronavirus\npandemic. Some covid-19 patients refuse to be treated by them. And when doctors and nurses leave the hospital, they face increasing harassment in their daily lives, too.\nAsian Americans have experienced a sharp increase in racist verbal abuse and physical attacks during the pandemic, with the FBI warning of a potential surge in hate crimes\nagainst Asians as the coronavirus death toll mounts and stay-at-home orders are lifted.\n\"People are worried about transmission of a disease that they associate with foreignness and Asian faces,\" said Grace Kao, a Yale University sociologist. \"Nothing erases what we\nlook like.\"\nThere is no comprehensive data measuring anti-Asian bias during the pandemic. An analysis of self-reported incidents by Russell Jeung, chairman of the Asian American studies\ndepartment at San Francisco State University, shows a steady rise in reports of harassment and assaults against Asians since mid-March, with twice as many women as men\nsaying they have been mistreated.\nJeung, who is researching racism and xenophobia amid the coronavirus pandemic, said a multilingual website set up by his department in a partnership with civil rights groups\nto document anti-Asian harassment has recorded more than 1,800 incidents since its March 19 launch. Victims said they were spat on, stabbed while shopping, shunned for\nwearing masks and barred from entering ride-hailing vehicles.\nSome academic experts on race say President Trump's rhetoric regarding the virus and China has contributed to the rise in racial harassment. For weeks, Trump deliberately\nreferred to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus\" despite guidance from public health officials to avoid attaching locations or ethnicity to a disease. He has since tweeted that\nAsian Americans are not to be blamed for the virus's spread.\n\"Words matter. People are making that close association between the virus and Chinese people because he insisted on using that term,\" Jeung said.\nDuring a media briefing last week, Trump lashed out at CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, who is Chinese American, telling her to \"ask China\" after she\nquestioned him on why he insisted on making testing a global competition at a time when so many lives are being lost. Jiang previously tweeted that a White House official had\ncalled the virus \"the Kung-Flu\" to her face.\nWhite House adviser Peter Navarro, in an ABC News interview Sunday, accused China of sending \"hundreds of thousands of Chinese\" to \"seed\" the coronavirus around the\nworld. And Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) drew criticism after he blamed the virus's spread on \"thugs in China\" in a high school graduation speech over the weekend.\nJeung said he expects harassment and violence against Asian Americans to grow in coming months as states reopen their economies and people return to work, school and\npublic life.\n\"With the China-bashing and with the economy tanking and more deaths from covid-19, we expect anti-Asian bias to only increase,\" Jeung said. \"People make automatic\nassumptions, especially in times of threats, and go into fight-or-flight mode. The fight mode is attacking or harassing Asians, and the flight mode is shunning Asians.\"\nFormer Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has encouraged Asian Americans to step up and \"show our American-ness in ways we never have before,\" in response to\nthe rise in racist abuse. In a controversial op-ed last month, he called on Asian Americans to be part of the \"cure.\"\nBut many Asian Americans felt offended by seemingly having to justify their existence. \"It shouldn't matter if you're a front-line worker,\" said Esther Choo, an emergency room\nphysician in Portland, Ore., who hosts a podcast on the coronavirus pandemic. \"Every time something like this happens, there's this wave of, 'But we're so good, and we don't\ndeserve this.' No, you don't deserve this because you're human.\"\nBeing a front-line worker didn't help Li - and when she texted her colleagues to warn them before they left work, one of them responded with her own story of being harassed\njust a week earlier.\nGem Manalo, a Mass General anesthesiology resident who is of Chinese and Filipino descent, was riding the \"T,\" as the subway is\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
