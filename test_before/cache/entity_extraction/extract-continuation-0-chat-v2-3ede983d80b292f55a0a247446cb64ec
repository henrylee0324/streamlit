Others keep watch from their cars or patrol the nearby parks.\nThe Sis moved to this upscale Ladera Ranch neighborhood a few months ago, with the country deep in the COVID-19 pandemic and hate crimes against Asian Americans on the rise.\nAlmost immediately, teenagers swooped in for nightly visits, repeatedly ringing the doorbell, yelling and pounding on the door.\nOne told Haijun Si to \"go back to your country.\" Another called Si's wife a pejorative slur used to describe a Chinese person. Some threw rocks.\nSometimes, the interruptions came just as the family sat down for dinner.\nOther times, Si's 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son were jarred awake at midnight.\nSi and his wife took turns standing guard outside. They installed a new fence and cameras. They called the police.\nBut the attacks kept coming -- until their new neighbors stepped in.\n\"I did not understand the extent of the harassment and how often it was occurring, at first,\" said Layla Parks, who organized the nightly neighborhood watch. \"I was immediately outraged and wanted to help.\"\nViolence and hate incidents directed at Asian Americans have surged across California, including in Orange County, since the beginning of the pandemic, with some blaming Asians because of the coronavirus' origins in Wuhan, China.\nA recent spate of violent attacks in Oakland, San Francisco, New York City and elsewhere has attracted national attention and sparked fear among Asian Americans, though it is unclear whether some of the incidents were racially motivated.\nIn February in Koreatown, two men hurled anti-Asian slurs at a 27-year-old Korean American U.S. Air Force veteran, calling him \"Chinese virus\" and then swinging at him, he told KTLA.\n\"We're seeing an epidemic of hate right now, and we have to stand together,\" state Sen. Dave Min (D-Irvine), who represents the district just west of Ladera Ranch, said last week at an event to show support for the Si family.\nWhile officials in Orange County are still compiling information on reports made in 2020, preliminary statistics indicate a tenfold increase in hate incidents against Asian Americans, said Alison Edwards, chief executive of the nonprofit OC Human Relations.\nIt's a troubling uptick that experts have blamed in part on Donald Trump's rhetoric about the pandemic, including his use of terms such as \"China virus\" and \"kung flu.\"\nLast year, California saw a consistent increase in hate incidents and crimes targeting Asian Americans, said Brian Levin, executive director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino.\nStereotyping and conspiracy theories identifying Asians as responsible for COVID-19 have been embraced by wide swaths of the country, Levin said, with a new Center for Public Integrity/Ipsos poll showing that nearly 1 in 4 Americans have concerns about being physically near Asian people.\nA \"catalytic event\" like the pandemic, with stereotyping by political and social influencers acting as an accelerant, often leads to increased targeting of racial groups, Levin said.\nThe attacks against the Si family fit another pattern -- the homes of minority residents tend to be targeted by neighbors in certain age groups, Levin said.\n\"The most common offenders of these residential crimes are turf-oriented youths with moderate prejudices out for a thrill or older neighbors reacting to a perceived threat or change,\" Levin said.\nThe Si family arrived in the U.S. from China four years ago. In September, the family moved to Ladera Ranch from Corona, looking to escape the Inland Empire heat and attracted by the planned community's lush trees, neatly manicured lawns and parks.\nLadera Ranch is a friendly place, where neighbors frequently share meals or spend evenings chatting on the sidewalk as their kids play.\nBut, some residents say, there is a dark side to the unincorporated community of about 30,000 residents, which is about two-thirds white, 14% Latino and 13% Asian.\nAfter the attacks started, Si installed a $3,000 wrought-iron fence around his front porch and placed floodlights and cameras around the property.\nHe hung a heavy chain across his driveway to keep the teens from riding their bikes up to his door.\n\"My kids are scared. I'm very annoyed,\" said Si, 48. \"At night, my wife and I could not sleep for more than three or four hours. Please, parents, tell your kids don't do that again.\"\nThe Orange County Sheriff's Department has been called to the home seven times between October and February. Deputies have ramped up patrols in the area, and the department has launched an investigation, Sgt. Dennis Breckner said.\nStill, the doorbell kept ringing, Si said. Nothing helped until his neighbors stepped in, vowing to put an end to the harassment.\nParks, who takes daily walks around the neighborhood, had introduced herself to Si and his family when she noticed them moving in last year.\nIn early February, Si reached out to Parks for advice. He had already told her about the constant doorbell ringing, and she had offered to help if needed.\nAt first, she figured it was a harmless childhood prank of \"ding-dong ditch.\"\nBut as the harassment continued, including racial slurs against the family, Parks realized this was something uglier.\n\"It makes me physically ill,\" said Parks, 30. \"This has opened my eyes to the racism that is alive and well in Ladera Ranch. It's definitely made me sad for this community, because this is just a wonderful place full of friends and neighbors that love and care about each other.\"\nOn a neighborhood Facebook group, Parks posted footage from Si of a recent attack and sought volunteers to guard the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SI FAMILY<|>PERSON<|>The Si family, originally from China, moved to Ladera Ranch and faced harassment during the COVID-19 pandemic due to rising hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADERA RANCH<|>GEO<|>Ladera Ranch is an upscale neighborhood in California where the Si family resides, known for its friendly community but also for recent incidents of racial harassment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAIJUN SI<|>PERSON<|>Haijun Si is a member of the Si family who has been targeted with racial slurs and harassment since moving to Ladera Ranch.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAYLA PARKS<|>PERSON<|>Layla Parks is a neighbor who organized a neighborhood watch to support the Si family and combat the harassment they faced.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Orange County is the region in California where Ladera Ranch is located, experiencing a surge in hate incidents against Asian Americans during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased hate crimes against Asian Americans, including the harassment faced by the Si family.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALISON EDWARDS<|>PERSON<|>Alison Edwards is the chief executive of the nonprofit OC Human Relations, which reported a tenfold increase in hate incidents against Asian Americans in Orange County.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRIAN LEVIN<|>PERSON<|>Brian Levin is the executive director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino, who commented on the rise of hate incidents targeting Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAIJUN SI<|>LADERA RANCH<|>Haijun Si and his family moved to Ladera Ranch, where they faced racial harassment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAYLA PARKS<|>SI FAMILY<|>Layla Parks organized a neighborhood watch to help protect the Si family from harassment<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORANGE COUNTY<|>SI FAMILY<|>The Si family is part of the community in Orange County, which has seen a rise in hate incidents against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>SI FAMILY<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to the increase in hate crimes against the Si family<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALISON EDWARDS<|>ORANGE COUNTY<|>Alison Edwards reported on the increase in hate incidents in Orange County during the pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRIAN LEVIN<|>ORANGE COUNTY<|>Brian Levin discussed the rise of hate incidents in Orange County, providing context for the situation faced by the Si family<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
