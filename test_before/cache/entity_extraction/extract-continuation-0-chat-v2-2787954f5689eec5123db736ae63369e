It was also an example, school officials said, of coronavirus-related racism that has run rampant\nsince the beginning of the pandemic, often directed at the Asian community.\nJoel Stembridge, Newton South's principal, wrote to the school community Thursday morning, calling the episode “clearly racist,\nhateful, and horrible.\"\n“This was a traumatic experience for our teacher and students, and we will continue to offer support to everyone involved,\" Stembridge\nsaid via e-mail. “To be clear, an attack on members of our NSHS Asian-American community is an attack on all of us. We will be working\non a plan for responding — I will share more about this soon.\"\nAll Zoom meetings scheduled for Thursday were canceled, allowing the IT department and staff to check security protocols. Classes\nwere to resume Friday, said Julie McDonough, a school spokeswoman.\n“Our counseling staff is reaching out to every student today,\" McDonough said. “We are scheduling a meeting with student leaders and\nteachers to plan a response. Hate speech and racism have no place at South and won't be tolerated.\"\nSchool officials notified students' families and local police, who were investigating. Teachers and students were working with officials to\ngather information about the intruders, who did not appear to be associated with the high school, according to Stembridge's e-mail.\nThe intruders may have accessed the meeting through a link to the call that was created before security updates were made in recent\nweeks, Stembridge said. Hundreds of calls had been successful prior to the incident, he added.\nThe intrusion comes as millions of people adopt the online platform for work or education. Since the pandemic started, Zoom has\nstruggled to keep up with security features to prevent such incidents.\nAfter two Massachusetts schools reported “Zoom-bombing\" in March, FBI officials in Boston urged users to take security precautions,\nsuch as sending links to participants directly instead of posting links in publicly available areas and making sure users have the most\ncurrent version of Zoom's teleconferencing software.\n“This is a trying time for all of us, and events such as these underscore the fragility of this new environment in which we are working,\"\nStembridge wrote. “We'll have more work to do to ensure that we can continue to support students and build a safe, connected online\ncommunity.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEWTON SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Newton South High School is an educational institution where the incident of Zoom-bombing occurred during an advanced placement Chinese class.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOEL STEMBRIDGE<|>PERSON<|>Joel Stembridge is the principal of Newton South High School who addressed the community regarding the Zoom-bombing incident.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JULIE MCDONOUGH<|>PERSON<|>Julie McDonough is a school spokeswoman for Newton South High School who provided information about the school's response to the incident.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZOOM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Zoom is an online platform used for virtual meetings, which was hacked during a class session at Newton South High School.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZOOM-BOMBING<|>EVENT<|>Zoom-bombing is a phenomenon where unauthorized individuals disrupt a Zoom meeting, as occurred during the advanced placement Chinese class at Newton South High School.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORONAVIRUS-RELATED RACISM<|>EVENT<|>Coronvirus-related racism refers to the discrimination and hate speech directed at the Asian community during the pandemic, highlighted by the incident at Newton South High School.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOEL STEMBRIDGE<|>NEWTON SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL<|>Joel Stembridge is the principal of Newton South High School and addressed the community about the incident<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULIE MCDONOUGH<|>NEWTON SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL<|>Julie McDonough is the school spokeswoman for Newton South High School, providing updates on the incident<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZOOM<|>NEWTON SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL<|>Zoom was the platform used for the class that was disrupted by the Zoom-bombing incident<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZOOM-BOMBING<|>NEWTON SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL<|>The incident at Newton South High School was a case of Zoom-bombing, where hackers disrupted a class<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORONAVIRUS-RELATED RACISM<|>ZOOM-BOMBING<|>The Zoom-bombing incident was described as an example of coronavirus-related racism affecting the Asian community<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
