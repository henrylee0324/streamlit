All across the country, hog farmers faced the same grim\nscenario.\n***\nThe virus had forced farmer Greg Boerboom to revert to his dad's old way of doing\nbusiness, selling a few hogs here or there and stocking the butcher shops on nearby Main\nStreets. But Boerboom isn't the nostalgic type. When the Smithfield and Tyson buyers\nreturned in late May, he rejoiced and credited Trump's executive order.\nThe order was a boon for those major corporations, which as it turns out were never at risk\nfor a severe meat shortage. In fact, a significant portion of the hogs Boerboom sold to\nSmithfield and Tyson likely ended up not in American kitchens, but in Chinese ones.\nMarket data showed that during the period when meatpacking executives were warning\nthat the food supply chain was breaking, they were exporting millions of tons of meat\noverseas – even more than in previous years.\nThe federal government had prioritized the production of meat over the safety of low-paid,\nmostly-immigrant workers. In the months following Trump's executive order, plant\noperators claimed to have implemented safety guards such as plexiglass barriers and\nmandatory masks. But there was little federal oversight monitoring those measures.\nCOVID-19 cases in the plants skyrocketed, and often so did the case counts of their\nsurrounding communities.\nAs of September, there would be more than 200 deaths among meatpacking workers\nwho had contracted the virus.\nBoerboom thinks the media has mostly ignored the real story, which is post-traumatic\nstress and depression he predicts will linger with hog farmers. \"The big story is going to\nbe the financial and emotional drain to the farming community in small-town America,\"\nhe said.\nBut he says Trump deserves gratitude for returning the business to the status quo even\nin the midst of a pandemic. \"I think that's what saved our industry,\" Boerboom said. \"If\nhe had not done that, we would be out of business today.\"\nThanksgiving: 263,456 deaths\nIn early April, Gina Jere drove to a cremation center where a man in full protective gear\ndropped into her trunk a triple-bagged Hefty containing Cookie Dungill's watch, glasses,\ncell phone and a container of his ashes.\nWhen her brother Sevil Dungill learned that their father had died, he was still in the\nthroes of his own severe sickness, isolated on the first floor of his house.\nHe kept six feet away as he told his teenage son about Cookie's passing.\n\"We're not going to grieve right now,\" said Dungill, who was terrified of infecting his wife\nand son. \"Because grieving makes you weak.\"\nDungill finally left his home after nearly two months of sickness in isolation. He emerged\nto a changed world full of face masks and strange new rituals at the supermarket.\nProtests and riots then followed and brought shattered storefronts to his Chicago\nneighborhood.\nLike other families that have lost loved ones this year, it's hard to predict when, if ever,\nthe Dungills will be able to properly grieve. There was no funeral or memorial for Cookie\nDungill and, considering the results of the family's last gathering to mark a death, there\nprobably never will be.\nFor Sevil Dungill, the lack of closure concerning his father's death has also consumed his\nperspective on the other family members he lost in 2020. Like Darryl Ospring's fixation\non her mother's January death in the Bay Area, Dungill suspects that COVID-19 was\nresponsible for the deaths of his sister in January and his mother in February.\nBefore his family's saga with the illness, he accepted without doubt that their deaths\nwere a result of cancer.\nBut he has since thought back on their sudden declines. His sister Angeli was put under\na hospital ventilator before dying, according to her death certificate, of acute respiratory\ndistress syndrome, pneumonia and metastatic lung cancer. His mother's official cause of\ndeath was aspiration pneumonia and congestive heart failure.\nThe lung-related conditions are hallmarks of COVID-19 deaths. But Dungill will never\nknow for sure, since both women were cremated and not autopsied.\nContributing: Matt Wynn, Dian Zhang and Brett Murphy\nArtist Suzanne Firstenberg walks through an installation on the DC Armory Parade\nGround on , Oct. 23 in Washington, DC.
