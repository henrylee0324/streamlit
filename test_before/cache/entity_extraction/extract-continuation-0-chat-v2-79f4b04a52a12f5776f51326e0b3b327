Brendon Woods, the county public defender whose\noffice is representing the suspect, said Mr. Muslim has a history of mental illness and substance abuse and there is no evidence of bias against Asian-Americans in the case.\nThe assaults spurred Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley to create a special response unit that she said would include members who speak Cantonese and Mandarin\nthat will aim to build trust and engagement with crime victims.\n\"Since the onset of Covid-19 we have seen an uptick in crime against Asian Americans,\" Ms. O'Malley said.\nIn San Francisco, video of a Jan. 28 attack on Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old man originally from Thailand, has spurred fear among elderly Asian-Americans in the city, local\nactivists said. Mr. Ratanapakdee was on a morning walk in a residential enclave when he was knocked to the ground by a man who ran into him. Mr. Ratanapakdee died two days later\nat a local hospital.\nThe authorities have charged Antoine Watson, 19, with murder and elder abuse.\nSliman Nawabi, a public defender representing Mr. Watson, said his client didn't intend to kill Mr. Ratanapakdee and likely wasn't aware of the man's race or age. Mr. Watson pleaded\nnot guilty to the charges.\n\"I know it's gotten a lot of attention...because there's been other incidents in the Bay Area, and nationally, targeting Asian-Americans,\" Mr. Nawabi said. \"But this case here is not\nmotivated by Mr. Ratanapakdee's race or his age.\"\nAccording to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, attacks on people of Asian descent in the U.S. have been on the rise since\nthe start of the pandemic last year. In March and April, there were more anti-Asian hate crimes in various cities than the previous totals for the full year of 2019, said Brian Levin, a\nprofessor of criminal justice and director of the center.\nNew York City had a record year of hate crimes against Asians in 2020, according to preliminary data, while in Los Angeles and San Jose, such crimes more than doubled from 2019,\naccording to preliminary data analyzed by Dr. Levin. The attacks range from people being spat on to assaults.\nThe New York Police Department formed this past fall an Asian Hate Crime Task Force , its first-ever task force dedicated to investigating crimes targeting a single race.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California, known for its diverse population and recent incidents of anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where police arrested a suspect in a series of assaults in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YAHYA MUSLIM<|>PERSON<|>Yahya Muslim is a 28-year-old man arrested in connection with assaults in Oakland's Chinatown, with a history of mental illness and substance abuse.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRENDON WOODS<|>PERSON<|>Brendon Woods is the public defender representing Yahya Muslim.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NANCY O'MALLEY<|>PERSON<|>Nancy O'Malley is the Alameda County District Attorney who created a special response unit to address anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old man originally from Thailand who was attacked and later died from his injuries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTOINE WATSON<|>PERSON<|>Antoine Watson is a 19-year-old man charged with murder and elder abuse in the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, studies hate crimes, including those against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York Police Department formed an Asian Hate Crime Task Force to investigate crimes targeting Asian individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JANUARY 28<|>EVENT<|>January 28 is the date of the attack on Vicha Ratanapakdee.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YAHYA MUSLIM<|>BRENDON WOODS<|>Brendon Woods is the public defender representing Yahya Muslim in court<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANCY O'MALLEY<|>OAKLAND<|>Nancy O'Malley created a special response unit in Alameda County to address the rise in anti-Asian violence, which includes incidents in Oakland<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>ANTOINE WATSON<|>Antoine Watson is charged with the murder of Vicha Ratanapakdee, who died from injuries sustained in an attack<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>COVID-19<|>The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism reports an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>COVID-19<|>The New York Police Department formed an Asian Hate Crime Task Force in response to the rise in hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was attacked in San Francisco, leading to increased fear among elderly Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OAKLAND<|>YAHYA MUSLIM<|>Yahya Muslim was arrested in Oakland for a series of assaults in the city's Chinatown<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
