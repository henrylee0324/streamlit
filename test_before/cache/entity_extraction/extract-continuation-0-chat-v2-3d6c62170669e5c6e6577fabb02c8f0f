Lawson added that his wife, who is Thai, was verbally assaulted twice and told to \"go back to China\" before the attack.\"Everyone is dancing around the issue, and no one's addressing it,\" he said.San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin filed murder and elder abuse charges against Antoine Watson, but his office has \"no evidence of what motivated this senseless attack,\" spokesperson Rachel Marshall told USA TODAY.In San Jose, a 64-year-old Vietnamese woman was assaulted last Wednesday and robbed of $1,000 in cash she had withdrawn for the holiday. No arrest has been made, and there is no indication the robbery was race-related, said public information officer Sgt. Christian Camarillo.That same day in New York, 61-year-old Noel Quintana, who is of reportedly Filipino descent, was slashed in the face with a box cutter on the subway. Spokesperson Detective Sophia Mason told USA TODAY police were investigating but did not answer questions about whether the incident may have been motivated by race.\"Although it's unclear whether the particular cases are racially motivated, they are certainly \"related\" and \"horrific,\" Jeung said.\"What makes it worse is we see our elderly and youth also targeted,\" he said. \"It seems like people are attacking vulnerable populations.\"John C. Yang, president and CEO of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC said his organization has been tracking anti-Asian hate incidents and crimes for nearly 30 years and has received hundreds more hate incident reports in 2020 than in previous years. He said polls by IPSOS and Pew Research Center indicate that the true scope of hate Asian Americans are experiencing is probably much larger, and better data is needed.\"Although these reports are clearly incomplete, clearly just the tip of the iceberg that shows us that there is this dramatic increase in hate incidents,\" he said, noting that it's too soon to tell if that increase is continuing in 2021.There are several reasons victims of a hate crime may not report it to the police, according to Yang.Yang said victims may not be aware of the resources available for them, and there may be language barriers to accessing those resources for older Asian Americans in particular. He said there may be cultural barriers to reporting as well, including shame around being perceived as a victim. Some victims may also be concerned about interacting with law enforcement because of their immigration status.Yang added that not all hate incidents rise to the level of crime, but they still \"clearly inflict a level of mental trauma.\" He estimated that only about 10% of the incidents reported to his organization could be considered crimes.Jeung, of Stop AAPI Hate, said that in addition to crimes such as physical violence, Asian Americans have reported experiencing violations of their civil rights including being denied service by businesses or rideshares, being verbally harassed with racial slurs and facing vandalism and property damage.He said his wife was deliberately coughed on while jogging, noting the similarities to a New Jersey incident where a man was charged with making a terroristic threat after coughing on a supermarket employee and saying he had the coronavirus.\"There is such a climate of hate and anger that we need to again lower the temperature and remind people to treat others with respect,\" he said.President Joe Biden signed a memorandum in late January denouncing xenophobia and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Yang said the Biden administration's words have made a difference, but the recent violence has caused the community to \"hunker down again\" during a normally celebratory time.He said more needs to be done to ensure victims have support systems and to educate bystanders about safe intervention. He warned against relying too heavily on law enforcement.Despite the horrific crimes, Jeung was excited to see the Oakland community organizing efforts to reduce crime in the neighborhood.\"What I'm really heartened by is the Asian American community is really standing up,\" he said. \"I want people to know we're not simply victims of discrimination, but we're advocating for racial justice for everyone in the United States and we'll continue to do so.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LAWSON<|>PERSON<|>Lawson is a person who commented on the racial issues surrounding attacks on Asian individuals and mentioned his Thai wife being verbally assaulted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHESA BOUDIN<|>PERSON<|>Chesa Boudin is the San Francisco District Attorney who filed charges against Antoine Watson related to a murder and elder abuse case.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTOINE WATSON<|>PERSON<|>Antoine Watson is the individual charged with murder and elder abuse in connection with a racially charged attack.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RACHEL MARSHALL<|>PERSON<|>Rachel Marshall is a spokesperson for Chesa Boudin's office, commenting on the lack of evidence regarding the motivation behind the attack.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city where a racially charged attack occurred, leading to charges against Antoine Watson.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN JOSE<|>GEO<|>San Jose is a city where a 64-year-old Vietnamese woman was assaulted and robbed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOEL QUINTANA<|>PERSON<|>Noel Quintana is a 61-year-old man of Filipino descent who was attacked on the subway in New York.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is the city where Noel Quintana was attacked on the subway.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN C.
