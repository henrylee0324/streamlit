Asian communities are in crisis and need some of that same energy now. Since thebeginning of the pandemic, Asians have been and continue to be targeted with increasing violence at alarming\nrates, reinforcing their existence as perpetual foreigners who do not truly belong here, whether born here or\nnot. The history of anti-Asian racism is long in the United States; this is the latest chapter of America not\nwanting them here.\nThe U.S. reluctantly tolerated Chinese immigrants in the mid-1860s for backbreaking dangerous railroad work\nthat white workers would not do in order to connect the U.S. with the Transcontinental Railroad. Soon afterward,\nthe danger of Yellow Peril became a concern and in 1882, the first American stance on anti-immigration would\nbe the catalyst for future immigration policies, better known as the Chinese Exclusion Act. In February 1942, the\nU.S. rounded up and interned Japanese Americans and Asian Americans of non-Japanese descent after the\nbombing of Pearl Harbor.\nThe model minority myth has been, and continues to be, used as a racial wedge to further policies against Black\ncommunities (and other nonwhite groups). But has there been progress? Well there's a whole heritage month\nfor Asians in May. Now think back to how many non-Asians posted about it on their social media as they do for\nPride, Black History, or Hispanic Heritage months. AAPI Awareness Month did not even become official until\n1992. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic made navigating public spaces dangerous for Asians. The prior\nadministration's insistence to call it the China/Chinese virus only helped to incite anti-Asian attacks to startling\nnumbers. In April, NBC News reported over 30% of Americans have witnessed COVID-19 bias against Asians.\nEven more problematic is that attackers are not easily recognizable, they are not a \"type\" and have no specific\nrace, identity, or group.\nIndeed, Asian Americans are fair game for everyone as evidenced by Jose Gomez's confession in his attempt to\nmurder an Asian American family including a 2-year-old child in Midland, Texas. Let that sink in - a 2-year-old\nchild, simply because they are Asian. Phased reopenings show an increase in these attacks as some view Asians\nas the cause of the virus, or even as a virus themselves. Even medical professionals on the front lines saving\nlives regardless of patient race or identity are in danger because they are Asian. In January of this year, an 84-\nyear-old Thai man was pushed to his death in San Francisco. The elderly are especially vulnerable to recent\nattacks and Asian businesses are being violently vandalized across the country.\nAn early response to this current wave of anti-Asian racism came from highly visible Asian leader and former\npresidential candidate Andrew Yang, who advised Asian Americans in a Washington Post op-ed to \"show our\nAmerican-ness in ways we never have before,\" by helping the country in its time of need. The implication of\nYang's response is for Asian Americans to continue the perpetuation of the model minority myth, the danger of\nwhich extols the virtue to suffer in silence. Do not make waves; keep your head down. A more recent response\ncame from President Joe Biden, in the form on an executive order he signed days after his inauguration in an\nattempt to address the situation with directives to federal agencies.\nWhat Asian Americans (and Asians globally) do need to fight against anti-Asian racism is active allyship from\nnon-Asians. To start with, when Asians (or Black, Indigenous, or persons of color - BIPOC) express experiences\nof racism, whether witnessed or not, do not dismiss their concerns. BIPOC folks survive racism on a continuousbasis and to not believe their lived experiences and fears is a flagrant flaunting of privilege. Asians need non-\nAsian folks to check in, speak out, stand up, and advocate for them through whatever platforms they have.Support of #StopAsianHate does not diminish anti-racism support of Black communities and other marginalized\ngroups.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
