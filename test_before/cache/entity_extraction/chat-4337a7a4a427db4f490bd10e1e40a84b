The visitor was her new mother-inlaw, whom after a whirlwind engagement she had met for only the first time that day. In her\nhands was a \"gigantic\" book, and what was written inside was also unexpected: proof that her new husband, Dr Gabriel Chiu, a renowned Los Angeles-based plastic surgeon, was \"the 24th generation direct\ndescendant of the Song dynasty\".\nThe suggestion was that Gabriel, king of Beverly Hills' boobs and bottoms, would have been the sovereign of a vast Chinese empire had it not been overthrown in the 13th century. It came as a surprise to\nChristine, who was born in Taiwan but grew up in California. She knew little about\nancient Chinese dynasties. Her mother-inlaw took her through hundreds of years of male emperors listed in the book, and their progeny. At the end was her husband's name, followed by an empty space. \"It is\nvery important that you do not let us down,\" she was told. The family wanted a male heir to continue the line.\nChristine, then 24, and Gabriel, 15 years her senior, started trying for a baby emperor at their Bel Air home. But she couldn't get pregnant. They did rounds and rounds of IVF, with different techniques and\ndifferent doctors ? the best that money could buy. A decade passed and still there was no heir. \"I just saw that empty space I was supposed to fill,\" Christine says. \"That was my job, that is the one thing they\nasked of me, that was my value.\" At family gatherings she was made to sit at the children's table and wash the dishes, all the while harbouring the secret that it was actually her husband who\nhad fertility problems. She silently \"bore his shame\" for 11 years. Eventually, in 2018, she gave birth to Gabriel Christian Chiu III, or \"Baby G\" as they call him. He arrived chubby-cheeked, dressed in Versace and\nready to rule his imaginary kingdom.\nNow 38, Christine is one of the stars and producers of Bling Empire, the latest Netflix docuseries to adopt the tried-and-tested formula of following the seemingly vacuous lives and eye-popping consumption of a\ngroup of super-rich friends. The difference is that this show has an all-Asian cast. It's Crazy Rich Asians meets Keeping Up with the Kardashians ? solid gold trash but with layers of cultural intrigue; yes, it's about\ncash, cars, clothes and plastic surgery, but it's also about the balance ? and tension ? between therapised, liberal life in LA and east Asian traditions and responsibilities.\n\"These are stories of infertility, surrogacy, parenthood ? difficult topics across any ethnicity, but set against the backdrop of very traditional eastern expectations there is an additional layer of complexity,\" says\nChristine, speaking from her home office in Bel Air. She says she's dressed in Loro Piana cashmere \"sweats\", which cost about Â£1,800 each, but doesn't want to turn on her video. \"Nothing glamorous. I'm first a\nmom, then a businesswoman, then a personality and producer,\" she says. \"On TV screens Asian faces and perspectives are underrepresented, so the show was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.\"\nUsually dripping in \"high jewellery\", she is presented as the self-made, ponytailswinging mean girl of the series, the couture queen of Beverly Hills, never shy of putting on an ostentatious show of wealth or\nmentioning her (considerable) philanthropic pursuits ? and her acquaintance with the Prince of Wales.\nChristine and her husband, who are worth a reported Â£80 million through their private clinic, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, are the main backers of the Prince's Foundation Health & Wellbeing Centre at Dumfries\nHouse in East Ayrshire, Scotland, which uses complementary therapies to help locals with obesity, loneliness and depression. Two of its health lodges are named after none other than Baby G. The same Baby G\nwho, in one episode of Bling\nEmpire, is photographed for his preschool admission portrait, at the age of one, dressed in a tuxedo, sitting upright in a miniature sports car as $100 bills rain down.\nChristine's nemesis in the show is Anna Shay, 60, a withering matriarch figure to the younger cast members. She's the eccentric daughter of the late arms dealer Edward Shay, whose company was sold by Anna\nand her brother to Lockheed Martin for a reported $1.2 billion in cash in 2006.\nShay shops for diamonds as though they are sweets, throws dinner parties as though they are tests of allegiance and sounds lonely ? she met her best friend over the counter of her favourite jewellery house in\nParis. She trusts few people ? particularly not Christine, whom she appears to view as a name-dropping, nouveau riche pretender.\nThe two are set up as frozen-faced frenemies. In one episode Christine is moved to the wrong end of the dinner table for wearing a diamond necklace that Shay also owns. \"I mean, I was seated to the left of\nPrince Charles at Buckingham Palace earlier this year,\" Christine complains. Shay is unfussed. \"I do find it odd that she wants to compete with me,\" she purrs. \"But she cannot compete with what I was born into.\"\n\"There are certainly discussions on new money versus old money,\" Christine tells me when I ask about the characters' different attitudes towards wealth. \"I'm of a younger generation, so I am more open to\nspeaking about consumption. But I don't do it in a way of boasting.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
