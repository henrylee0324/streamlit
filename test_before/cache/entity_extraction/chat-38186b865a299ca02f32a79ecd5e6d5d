The Chinese diaspora, it turns out, is remarkably agile.“China is this incredible beacon in food,” said Marcus Samuelsson, the Ethiopian-Swedish host of “No Passport Required,” who has made Harlem his home. “We’re relearning about heritage, culture and history. That’s not just happening in the food world but everywhere. We see it in taking down monuments, for example. We’re having a really important conversation in America and, if America is having it, very often the world is having it.”Sin’s mission is beyond gastro-diplomacy, approaching gastro-activism, using the culinary intersections as conversational starting points. Chefs are happy to join in.Damon, founder of Supper Club From Nowhere, a culinary history project inspired by civil rights chef Georgia Gilmore, cheered Sin’s request to collaborate. Amid what she called exhausting “Black for pay” propositions, designed to help brands burnish their political credentials by partnering with people of color, she called Distance Dining “a breath of fresh air.”“He’s already doing the work in himself,” she said. “There’s relief because I’m not doing this work alone. I’m not having this conversation alone.”Damon, whose mother is Gullah Geechee and father is Creole, sighed. “When we face those ugly parts of us and our distance, and we come together to reconcile with that, what does that taste like?” she said. “I want to look back and know what I was doing during the great COVID pandemic of 2020, when there was a nationwide, global movement for all Black lives. I want to know that I’m proud of what I was doing. I was cooking for a better future, cooking for a better me. When everything feels so bad, doing this feels good.”Chintan Pandya, chef at Adda Indian Canteen in Long Island City, Queens, said Distance Dining was an opportunity to showcase dishes that are authentic in a surprising way. The chile chicken he made with Sin, for example, was invented in the 1970s, when soy sauce and cornstarch were substituted for garam masala by members of the Chinese community that has flourished for decades in Kolkata.“It’s a very nostalgic dish,” Pandya said. “We’ve grown up eating it. The way we were exposed to Chinese food was this dish. What General Tso’s is to America, this dish is for India. It’s integral.”But the Chinese diaspora is not all about history or nostalgia. China is an emerging power in Africa, for example, and Pierre Thiam, chef of Teranga, in East Harlem, has noticed the nascent Chinatown of his native Dakar, the capital of Senegal.His collaboration with Sin used dawadawa (fermented locust beans) in an efo riro stew, as a nod to douchi (China’s fermented black beans), as well as fonio, a Senegalese grain, as tribute to China’s ancient, pre-rice Five Grains. They were substitutions he borrowed from his home kitchen, cooking with his fiancée, Lisa, who is Chinese-Japanese. Sin’s Eight Treasures pudding, in turn, was evocative of similar Senegalese desserts like sombi and thiakry.“When I first came to New York and wanted to cook something with dawadawa, I would go to Chinatown and get fermented beans there,” Thiam said. “The closest substitute I could get to the flavors of home would be the Chinese markets. There’s going to be a revolution in cuisine because Chinese are getting more prominent in Africa. I’m looking forward to that.”Sin’s idea, however, is not exactly new to anyone who has raved about Mei Lin’s mapo lasagna at Nightshade in Los Angeles, or the XO tartare at C.A.M. in Paris, or who remembers David Chang’s mapo ragù in 2006. And half a century ago, Chinese-Cuban restaurants sprang up across Manhattan. Chinese crossover has been on menus both divey and luxurious.Sin’s approach is emboldened and elevated by current events. After the death of Floyd, Sin knew the value of solidarity, he said, having seen it for years in Hong Kong’s own protests.Two years of collaboration at the Museum of Food and Drink, he added, taught him that “African American cooking really is the bedrock of American food culture.” The Black Lives Matter movement got him to act on that knowledge, embracing the cuisines of communities in crisis.Sin’s new education has been tumultuous. He said he now knows that Chinese restaurants have often seen historically redlined African American communities as “decent business opportunities,” which can become a potentially exploitative relationship.He is more and more angry at what he calls the white supremacy of the Anglicized renaming of “pot stickers” or “soup dumplings,” for example, in ways that are not applied to bratwurst, paella, pâté or ravioli. He has become more offended that Chinese food is “at the bottom of the price-point food chain” and more appreciative of flavors like the sweet-and-sour mumbo sauce of Chinese restaurants in Washington, D.C., because it’s “not part of the white palate.”Overall, he said, Distance Dining has amplified his creative sense of possibility — and cross-cultural optimism. His aim is to make the dinners permanent.“Many people celebrate history and tradition with food,” said Cecilia Chiang, the 99-year-old godmother of Chinese restaurants nationwide, who has eaten at the storied\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
