It may also account for the fact that according to one of the few existing research reports on anti-Asian hate, published this January in the U.S. National Library of Medicine, Asian Americans have a relatively higher chance than Blacks or Latinos of experiencing hate crimes perpetrated by non-white offenders.The report found that despite hate crimes against Asian Americans being on the rise, studies rarely look at such incidents. They are “largely ignored\" by researchers, and as a result the nature and characteristics of the offenders, victims, and situations are largely unknown, the report says.“The outrage, the decrying of these recent incidents, is because of centuries of invisibility, of feeling like the history of anti-Asian racism is not known, that what happens to our community is minimized, is overlooked,” said Choi, of Stop AAPI Hate.Compounding the challenge, the Asian American community is not monolithic. Instead, it’s broad and encompasses people who trace their ancestry from China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea and other countries, all with their own distinct languages and cultures.Shieh, of Asian Americans Advancing Justice of Chicago, said it’s often hard to persuade victims of racial harassment or hate crimes to come to police because they speak a language other than English, or worry about their immigration status. Chicago alone has 19 separate Asian communities.\"We're not even a singular group that can unite,” said Shieh, 28. “We forget that our country is not necessarily a black-and-white paradigm or dichotomy.\"Chen, of OCA, said Asian immigrants might worry about causing \"trouble.\"“They're being targeted as Asians because they (perpetrators) don’t think Asians are going to make as big as a fuss. It goes along with the stereotype that Asians are less likely to be vocal about things,” Chen said. “That’s changing as we have more and more young people growing up here, but so long as your majority of your population is first generation, like Houston’s AAPI majority...they don’t want to cause trouble, they just want to do their job, make a living, make sure their family is OK. They’re just trying to survive.”Lieu said Trump inflamed ’ passions when he wrongfully tied Asians to COVID-19.“It’s going to take education and time to mitigate the harm that was done last year,\" Lieu said, \"It’s not like you can flip a switch and people will stop engaging in discrimination.\"Oh, the Denver attorney, said the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated existing racial tensions – and the increasing violence has made it easier to speak up about them.Oh said she became a civil rights attorney in part because she felt Chicago police never took seriously the complaints from her parents that the frequent break-ins and robberies of their small restaurant were driven by the Korean heritage.\"Feeling heard has been so powerful for the Asian community,” she said.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
