As per reported incidents so far, xenophobia, more specifically sinophobia, is surging at an exponential rate across the globe. Stigmatization of Chinese people in wake of outbreak of coronavirus has become new normal in the world. People now look at Chinese with humongous disdain and contempt for they consider them as sole responsible for all the physical and mental afflictions that they are undergoing nowadays due to the COVID-19 which showed its first appearance in Chinese city of Wuhan.\nMoreover, this discrimination and antipathy is not only restricted to the Chinese people but people of East Asian and south Asian descent having appearance and facial resemblance with Chinese are also facing xenophobia, prejudice, racial apartheid and violence.\nAdmittedly, disease inculcates fear in human minds which in turn fosters discrimination. This had been happening in the history whenever there was outbreak of any pandemic. The chronological account of the world shows that during 1853, yellow-fever epidemic in the United States and European immigrants, who were perceived to be more vulnerable to the disease, were primary targets of stigmatization. During the SARS outbreak, which originated in China, East Asian bore the brunt. When the Ebola outbreak emerged in 2014, Africans were targeted. For this reason, the World Health Organization, which is keenly overseeing the global response to the coronavirus outbreak, opted against denoting a geographic location when officially naming the new virus, as it did with Ebola (named after the river in Congo, where it was first detected) and the 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome popularly known as MERS. \"Stigma to be honest is more dangerous than virus itself,\" remarked Dr Tedros Adhanom, the director general of the WHO in his press talk.\nHowever, we find newspapers replete with news pertaining to ballooning xenophobia and racial discrimination in the wake of outbreak of COVID-19. Surprisingly, even the country where from the virus was originated is not immune to this social epidemic of stigmatization. According to the world journal, there have been countless instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned away from hotels, because of their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers deliberately leaked online or dealing with harassing phone calls from strangers. Some places also reportedly had signs saying \"People from Wuhan and cars from Hubei are not welcomed here\".\nIn addition, on March 29, British daily The Guardian reported that Western and African expatriates in China were reporting enhanced racial hostility and discrimination in response to a shift of COVID-19 cases from local to imported ones. It claims that media in China have published articles entitled as \"Beware of a second outbreak started by foreign garbage\", and incidents of foreigners being barred from restaurants, shops, gyms and hotels, subjected to further screening, and verbal attacks and exclusion are mounting in china day in day out.\nMoreover, people of Hong Kong have also started displaying their antipathy for the people of mainland China. The restaurants in Hong Kong are now demanding customers to produce identity card of Hong Kong in order to prove that they are not from mainland. Tenno Ramen, a Japanese noodle restaurant in Hung Hom, refused to serve mainland Chinese customers. The restaurant said on Facebook, \"We want to live longer. We want to safeguard local customers. Please excuse us\".\nIndians too are evincing unjustified bias and prejudice towards Chinese people. Indian Islamic cleric Ilyas Sharfuddin said in an audio address that the coronavirus outbreak was a \"punishment of ALLAH on China for mistreating Uighur Muslims\". Ilyas said that \"they (the Chinese) have threatened the Muslims and tried to destroy lives of 20 million Muslims. Muslims were forced to drink alcohol, their mosques were destroyed and their Holy Book was burned. They thought that no one can challenge them, but Allah the most powerful, punished them.\"\nApart from this, in Israel, more than 1,000 South Korean tourists were instructed to avoid public places and remain in isolation in their hotels. The Israeli military announced its intention to quarantine some 200 South Korean nationals to a military base. Many of the South Koreans were rejected by hotels and were forced to spend nights at Ben Gaurian Airport. An Israeli newspaper subsequently published a Korean complaint that \"Israel is treating (Korean and other Asian) tourists like coronavirus\".\nSadly, in Japan also, the situation is no more different for Chinese, as the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been trending on Twitter; furthermore, on Twitter, Japanese people have called Chinese tourists \"dirty\", \"insensitive\", and \"bioterrorists\". According to an Ipsos MORI poll, 28% of Japanese respondents said they would consider avoiding people of Chinese origin in the future to protect themselves from coronavirus.\nWhat's more is that even in Singapore, An online petition urging the Singaporean government to ban Chinese nationals and travellers from China from entering the island country was signed by 125,000 people.\nTo add, the Ministry of Home Affairs of Singapore has ordered an investigation against an Islamic teacher, Abdul Halim bin Abdul Karim, after he posted on Facebook that the coronavirus pandemic was \"a retribution by Allah against the Chinese for their oppressive treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinxiang\". In a separate post, Abdul Halim claimed that Chinese people do not wash properly after defecating and were not as hygienic as Muslims, causing the virus to spread. Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam slammed the comments as \"silly\", \"xenophobic\" and \"thoroughly racist\" and is \"quite unacceptable from anyone, let alone someone who is supposed to be a religious teacher\".\nEven in England, on February 12, 202\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PAKISTAN<|>GEO<|>Pakistan is a country where xenophobia related to the COVID-19 pandemic has been reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is the city in China where the coronavirus outbreak first appeared, leading to stigmatization of its residents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization is an international public health agency overseeing the global response to the coronavirus outbreak.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR TEDROS ADHANOM<|>PERSON<|>Dr. Tedros Adhanom is the Director-General of the World Health Organization who commented on the dangers of stigma during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONG KONG<|>GEO<|>Hong Kong is a region where residents have shown antipathy towards people from mainland China during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TENNO RAMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tenno Ramen is a Japanese noodle restaurant in Hong Kong that refused service to mainland Chinese customers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ILLYAS SHARFUDDIN<|>PERSON<|>Ilyas Sharfuddin is an Indian Islamic cleric who made controversial statements linking the coronavirus outbreak to divine punishment for China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISRAEL<|>GEO<|>Israel is a country that quarantined South Korean tourists during the pandemic due to fears of the virus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH KOREA<|>GEO<|>South Korea is a country whose tourists faced discrimination and quarantine measures in Israel during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN<|>GEO<|>Japan is a country where anti-Chinese sentiment has been expressed during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>GEO<|>Singapore is a country where an online petition was created to ban Chinese nationals from entering due to the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ABDUL HALIM BIN ABDUL KARIM<|>PERSON<|>Abdul Halim bin Abdul Karim is an Islamic teacher in Singapore who made xenophobic comments regarding the coronavirus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K SHANMUGAM<|>PERSON<|>K Shanmugam is the Minister of Home Affairs and Law in Singapore who condemned xenophobic comments made by Abdul Halim.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WUHAN<|>PAKISTAN<|>The outbreak in Wuhan has led to xenophobia against Chinese people, including in Pakistan<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>DR TEDROS ADHANOM<|>Dr. Tedros Adhanom represents the World Health Organization, which is addressing stigma during the pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONG KONG<|>WUHAN<|>Residents of Hong Kong have shown discrimination against people from Wuhan during the pandemic<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TENNO RAMEN<|>HONG KONG<|>Tenno Ramen is a restaurant in Hong Kong that refused service to mainland Chinese customers<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ILLYAS SHARFUDDIN<|>PAKISTAN<|>Ilyas Sharfuddin's comments reflect the xenophobic attitudes present in Pakistan towards Chinese people<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISRAEL<|>SOUTH KOREA<|>Israel quarantined South Korean tourists due to fears of the coronavirus<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAPAN<|>WUHAN<|>Japan has seen anti-Chinese sentiment linked to the outbreak in Wuhan<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>ABDUL HALIM BIN ABDUL KARIM<|>Abdul Halim's comments in Singapore reflect xenophobic attitudes towards Chinese people<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K SHANMUGAM<|>ABDUL HALIM BIN ABDUL KARIM<|>K Shanmugam condemned the xenophobic comments made by Abdul Halim<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
