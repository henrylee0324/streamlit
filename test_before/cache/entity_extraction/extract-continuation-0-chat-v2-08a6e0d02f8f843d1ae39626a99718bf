Eighteen states don’t have a mandate and three states don’t even have a hate crime statute. We need to have change there on a national basis.”\n\nAsians need more support services activists say\nIn Atlanta where the slayings took place the disconnect between the Asian American community and police became strikingly clear in the aftermath said Stephanie Cho executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta. Law enforcement said the shootings were not race-driven. \n“People keep wondering ‘How come people don’t trust the police?’ or ‘Why aren’t these incidents being reported?’ And it’s because we aren’t taken seriously” said Cho who has been busy juggling funerals and meeting with victims’ families. She also met with President Joe Biden who she said pledged commitment to the community beyond the crisis during his visit to Atlanta last week.\nAsian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta called on state and local leaders last week to boost crisis-intervention resources and multilingual support across mental health legal and employment services in addition to dealing with the root causes of race-based violence and hate.\nCho hopes the momentum can ultimately be used to persuade state leaders to mandate multilingual election ballots statewide; even as of November’s election which saw Asian voter participation nearly double over 2016 the group was able to lobby just one county to print ballots in Korean she said.\nRaising levels of political involvement and representation is among the goals for national Asian American leaders too.\n“In light of all the things that have happened the level of frustration is almost at a boiling point with regard to representation” said Madalene Xuan-Trang Mielke executive director of the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies which offers training for those thinking about running for municipal or state office. “Without representation in public office we aren’t at the table.”\nThe lack of representation in Biden’s administration has been even more galling Mielke said given Georgia’s Asian American turnout in November an increase that eclipsed Biden’s margin of victory.\nKohli of Asian Americans Advancing Justice said that while having Asian Americans in political leadership roles is important those leaders will ultimately be judged on their actions.\n“The actual work that our leaders do is what will ultimately create trust in our community” said Kohli who counts among her priorities going forward ensuring that the needs of low-income Asian Americans are met. “Many Asian Americans are energized and we need to leverage that energy into social change.”\nSuch transformation is already underway said Russell Leong former editor of Amerasia Journal.\nYounger generations of Asian Americans not affected or unaware of the Chin case are taking to the streets – and in Oakland San Francisco and New York they’re helping to provide alternatives to heavier law enforcement by accompanying elderly community pedestrians as a safety measure.\nUntil recent events Leong said “a lot of young people saw organizing as posting something on Instagram or Facebook. That was the extent of political organizing. But with the attacks on women and the elderly – that’s a tangible event and you have to walk the walk. That’s made a difference.”\nUrging churches to stand up against white supremacy \nMeanwhile calls are growing for religious leaders to take a stand against the violence. This week the Asian American Christian Collaborative issued a strongly worded statement condemning what it described as an “evasion of responsibility” on the part of U.S. churches and denominations that it accused of perpetuating social conditions that have led to “unequal unjust and ungodly treatment and murders of racial minorities.”\nThe group’s statement signed by hundreds of faith leaders calls on church leaders to among other things increase representation of Asian Americans in church leadership and to commit to educational efforts to eliminate nationalism misogyny and xenophobia in their congregations. \nOn Sunday the coalition is organizing simultaneous prayer rallies nationwide in a show of solidarity against hate including in Los Angeles Houston Chicago New York Baltimore and Atlanta.\n“We felt like we needed to do something” said Michelle Ami Reyes the group’s vice president. “The response of the church as a whole to anti-Asian racism has been anemic.”\nWhile Black church leaders are climbing on board she said that larger evangelical denominations including the Southern Baptist Convention or fundamentalists like Los Angeles pastor John MacArthur have been reluctant to embrace the fight against injustice or to suggest that the issue extends beyond their Asian American congregants.\n\"They say that if you as a Christian care about confronting systemic injustice and oppression that you’re just buying into neo-Marxist ideology and you’re a danger to the church\" Reyes said.\nBut it's not just largely white churches that have shied away from taking a stand said coalition president Raymond Chang. Many Asian churches he said have also refrained from activism a gesture he called at odds with their origins which saw them as centers of community and advocacy for emerging immigrant populations.\n“Our focus is to get Asian American Christians engaged in activism and to see that it is not contrary to the gospel or Christian faith by any means\" Chang said. \"That’s something we’ve lost and need to recover – to be engaged with the realities of our society.”\nNext month he said the coalition will hold a summit in Chicago with local Asian American and Black church leaders to discuss the common issues they face and how to combine forces.\n“The Christian message is one that brings people who are divided together” Chang said. “That’s the whole message of reconciliation. But in the U.S. because our churches were established on top of a segregated society shaped by white supremacy they've never found ways to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant",
