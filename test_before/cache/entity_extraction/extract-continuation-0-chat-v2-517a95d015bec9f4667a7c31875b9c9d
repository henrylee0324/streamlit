There have been over 20 attacks in Oakland's Chinatown in the past two weeks\nthat the local Chamber of Commerce considered to be targeted against Asians. On January 31, an assailant\nviolently knocked a 91-year-old man to the ground and later attacked an older man and woman. On February 3in New York City, Noel Quintana, 61, was slashed across the face, and on the same day in Oakland, a 71-year-\nold grandmother was knocked to the ground while crossing the street and robbed.Such attacks are not new. On Twitter, the hashtag #VincentChin has surfaced, highlighting historical anti-Asian\nxenophobia and racism fueled by the US auto industry decline of the 1980s, leading to the murder of Chinese\nAmerican Vincent Chin in Detroit by two men who blamed Asians for their losing their jobs. Neither served\nprison time.\nFormer President Donald Trump fueled anti-Asian sentiment during the Covid-19 pandemic by using\ndiscriminatory rhetoric to describe the coronavirus, and may have contributed to the racist and violent attacks\nacross the United States. Between March and December 2020, the coalition Stop AAPI Hate documented over\n2,800 anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide.\nShortly after taking office, President Joe Biden signed a memorandum denouncing the Trump administration's\ndiscriminatory sentiments directed at the Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and to better\ncombat anti-Asian racism. As the new administration and local governments turn their attention towards this\nhuman rights issue, they should look to local efforts to combat anti-Asian violence and reimagine community\nsafety.\nCommunity and political leaders need to continue speaking up and denouncing these violent acts, and officials\nneed to ensure those who carry out criminal offenses are held to account.\nVarious community organizations have raised funds to support victims. Activists have called for increased\ninvestment in community-led programs and for attention to the factors that prevent Asian Americans,\nparticularly older people, from feeling safe in their communities.\nFederal and local agencies need to do more work with communities to combat racism. The richest country in the\nworld should not leave its most vulnerable communities to fend for themselves, especially during a major crisis.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old Asian-American who was killed in San Francisco while walking in his neighborhood on January 28.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOEL QUINTANA<|>PERSON<|>Noel Quintana is a 61-year-old man who was attacked in New York City on February 3, suffering a slash across the face.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The local Chamber of Commerce in Oakland is an organization that considered the recent attacks in Chinatown to be targeted against Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a coalition that documented over 2,800 anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide between March and December 2020.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States who used discriminatory rhetoric during the Covid-19 pandemic, contributing to anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the current President of the United States who signed a memorandum denouncing the previous administration's discriminatory sentiments against the AAPI community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCE CHIN<|>PERSON<|>Vincent Chin was a Chinese American who was murdered in Detroit in the 1980s, a victim of anti-Asian xenophobia and racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where numerous attacks against Asian-Americans have occurred, particularly in its Chinatown area.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California where Vicha Ratanapakdee was killed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is where Noel Quintana was attacked on February 3.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was killed in San Francisco, highlighting the issue of violence against Asian-Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOEL QUINTANA<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>Noel Quintana was attacked in New York City, part of a series of violent incidents against Asian-Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE<|>OAKLAND<|>The Chamber of Commerce in Oakland is concerned about the targeted attacks against Asians in the city<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>OAKLAND<|>Stop AAPI Hate documented incidents of anti-Asian hate, including those occurring in Oakland<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric during the pandemic is believed to have contributed to the rise in anti-Asian hate incidents documented by Stop AAPI Hate<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Joe Biden's administration is addressing the issues of anti-Asian racism that Stop AAPI Hate has documented<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCE CHIN<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Vincent Chin's murder is a historical example of anti-Asian violence that has been exacerbated by sentiments similar to those expressed by Donald Trump<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
