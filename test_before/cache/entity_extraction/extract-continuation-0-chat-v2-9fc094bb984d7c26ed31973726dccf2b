It's definitely made me sad for this community, because this is just a wonderful place full of friends and neighbors that love and care about each other.\"\nOn a neighborhood Facebook group, Parks posted footage from Si of a recent attack and sought volunteers to guard the family's home. She wanted coverage from 6 p.m. until at least midnight. Neighbors signed up in droves.\n\"I got involved because I'm raising a young child here. I don't want to put a 'for sale' sign in front of my house and say, 'I can't deal with this,' \" said Emily Lippincott, 40, who lives nearby in Rancho Mission Viejo. \"I kept seeing excuses being made, 'Oh, it's just kids being kids.' No, this is months of terrorizing this poor family.\"\nNeighbors estimate that from 15 to 20 children have participated in the harassment, one as young as 10.\nThree children have apologized, Si said. But Parks said one family sent a cease-and-desist letter after seeing their child in security video she posted on Facebook. The letter threatened her with a lawsuit if she didn't remove her post.\nAs the sun began to set on a recent Thursday, Parks stood outside the Sis' home, where Loden Pass curves onto Mocha Lane, assembling her troops. She kept close watch on a cluster of teenagers riding bicycles on the trails on a hillside overlooking the home.\n\"This is what we do all night,\" Parks said. \"We see kids and we go 'OK, are they good or are they bad?' Are they coming this way?\"\nTwo neighbors bundled up in coats to ward off the evening chill, grabbed flashlights and took their posts on top of the hill near the home.\nOthers stationed themselves around the neighborhood.\n\"I'm so thankful for my neighbors,\" Si said.\nIn the two weeks or so since the volunteers have been protecting the home, the harassment has lessened, but the teens haven't been completely deterred.\nOne evening, a group threw rocks at Si and volunteers who were chatting on the front lawn. Sometimes they yell profanities, neighbors said.\nThe next day, as Chinese families around the world celebrated the Lantern Festival, hundreds of residents gathered on the grassy lawn across the street to show their support.\nPeople held red lanterns and watched a traditional lion dance performance. Young children danced and clapped along to the music.\nMin, the state senator, said the Si family should not have been made to feel unsafe and unwelcome in their own home.\n\"The fact of the matter is -- as we see tonight -- we outnumber them,\" Min told the crowd.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PARKS<|>PERSON<|>Parks is a resident of Ladera Ranch who has been actively involved in protecting a family from harassment and raising awareness about racism in the community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMILY LIPPINCOTT<|>PERSON<|>Emily Lippincott is a 40-year-old resident of Rancho Mission Viejo who has joined the effort to guard the Si family's home against harassment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADERA RANCH<|>GEO<|>Ladera Ranch is a community where incidents of racism and harassment have been reported, prompting residents to take action.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANCHO MISSION VIEJO<|>GEO<|>Rancho Mission Viejo is a nearby community where Emily Lippincott resides.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SI<|>PERSON<|>Si is a member of the family that has been targeted for harassment and has sought help from neighbors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LANTERN FESTIVAL<|>EVENT<|>The Lantern Festival is a celebration observed by Chinese families, marked by gatherings and traditional performances, which took place while the harassment was ongoing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIN<|>PERSON<|>Min is a state senator who spoke in support of the Si family during the Lantern Festival, emphasizing community solidarity against harassment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARKS<|>SI<|>Parks is actively involved in protecting the Si family from harassment and has been vocal about the issues they face<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMILY LIPPINCOTT<|>SI<|>Emily Lippincott has joined Parks in the effort to guard the Si family's home and support them against harassment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LADERA RANCH<|>SI<|>Ladera Ranch is the community where the Si family resides and has been affected by the reported harassment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LADERA RANCH<|>PARKS<|>Ladera Ranch is the community where Parks is advocating against racism and harassment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LANTERN FESTIVAL<|>SI<|>The Lantern Festival was a community event where residents showed support for the Si family<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIN<|>SI<|>Min expressed support for the Si family during the Lantern Festival, highlighting their right to feel safe in their home<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIN<|>LADERA RANCH<|>Min addressed the community of Ladera Ranch during the Lantern Festival, emphasizing unity against harassment<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
