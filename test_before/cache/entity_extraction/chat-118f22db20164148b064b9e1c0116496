At first, it was novel and fun\nas I learned how it differed from Skype, FaceTime, and Google Hangouts. Events I once attended or produced in\nperson, such as moderating panels for organizations or theater shows, suddenly were possible to conduct with\nbetween 10 and 100 people virtually.\nIt's different talking to people primarily through my computer screen. I prepare for these meetings and events\nin my home office by putting on makeup, making sure there's decent lighting, and wearing a top I hadn't\npreviously worn on a chat. Then I hit \"start\" much like one would for a live television show. It took some time to\nstop looking at myself to check my posture or framing on-screen. After a while, I couldn't stand looking at the\nboxes in the groupings that feel much like \"The Brady Bunch\" or \"Hollywood Squares\" - now I simply ignore it.\nThe first Zoom event I moderated was held in May. It was an affinity group conversation with about 25 Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). It was for Oregon Humanities and the topic was anti-AAPI COVID-19\nracism. We commented about how emotional it was for us to be able to gather this way to talk. I still have\nsimilar feelings when I meet with friends and colleagues whom I haven't seen in person for a long time. I\nlearned to interview guests on my radio program via Skype or FaceTime long ago. It's not the same as meeting\nin person. It never can be. But it is possible to connect meaningfully when I meet with people using Zoom.\nOccasionally when I'm \"Zoomed out,\" I ask if a good old-fashioned phone call is possible, which is sometimes\nmore intimate and personal to me than Zoom. This type of communication allows me to walk around without\nbeing stuck in front of a monitor with people watching. It also allows me to fiddle around with un-done\nbusywork around the house.\nSince having to stay at home, I realized my anxiety and work stress were reduced. For 30 years, I've performed\nmost of my work within my home office, but I have also done a lot of public speaking and recorded field\ninterviews in public for radio documentaries and my local arts show, Stage & Studio, on KBOO. I used to look\nforward to a lunch meeting - or a theatre rehearsal or stage play - that would get me out of the house. But until\nlife changed so dramatically for all of us, I didn't grasp how much time and energy it took to be able to\nparticipate in these public engagements.\nI've learned through the years that I'm both an introvert and an extrovert - an omnivert, if you will. Yes, I\nattend parties or get on a stage to perform, but it's not natural for me. I have to gear up for public events. And\nat times I experience mild panic attacks and anxiety about putting myself in the spotlight. \"Busy weeks\" used to\nbe typical for me. Looking back, I think I got used to feeling tired. I wonder now if I can ever go back to that old\nschedule of constant multi-tasking and travel from place to place for my multiple jobs.\nNowadays, on the infrequent occasion when I actually go to a store or accompany my husband on an errand, I\nlook at everyone as a potential virus carrier. It saddens me to not be able to chit-chat with people, but at the\nsame time, I'm relieved I don't have to expend energy gearing up for in-person interactions or battling my\nunease with public speaking.\nI've always been an anxious person and prone to worry. I think it's something I inherited from my mother and\nfrom an insecure childhood. Not having to deal with anxiety on a near-daily basis has been better for my health.\nI sleep better, have time to exercise every day, and my life is more simple. This is a profound realization for me\n- and an indicator that I may not return fully to what I'd been doing. Maybe this is the way I should have always\nlived.\nWhen a vaccine is finally tested, approved, and distributed to the public, and we one day receive the \"all clear\"\n(that is the hope), we'll emerge profoundly changed. I cannot go back to the way I worked or the feelings of\nangst and exhaustion I used to tolerate. I suspect this may be true for others.\nBut for now, virtual conferencing and staying mostly at home seem to be the way things are in this time of\nZoom.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
