I didn't know how to respond. I felt he was justified for what he was saying because he had the video,\" recalls the 16-year-old, who was born in Taishan, Guangdong province, and emigrated to the US with his mother when he was a baby.\nJason has since discovered that the video was filmed three years ago in Palau, Micronesia - not in China.\nCases of harassment and bullying of Asian-Americans have surged in the United States since the coronavirus began spreading there, months after the first cluster of Covid-19 cases was reported in Wuhan in late December. This new wave of racism has inspired non-profit organisation Apex for Youth to take a stand.\nThe group organises workshops and mentoring for school-age Asian-Americans from disadvantaged backgrounds in New York.\nEven before the pandemic broke out, more than half of Asian-American students in the US said they had been bullied at school - which is more than any other ethnic group, says Jiyoon Mary Chung, interim executive director of Apex.\nApex recently surveyed 100 students on the social effects of the pandemic. Half the respondents expressed concern or anxiety about anti-Asian discrimination, and 15 per cent said they had directly experienced racism. Also, 40 per cent of respondents reported that their families had been affected financially by the virus outbreak.\n\"They hear things like, Chinese people are dirty or disgusting, or their own president calling the virus a 'Chinese virus',\" Chung says. \"When this happens, what do you say back? Or is the person worth your time? We encourage the students to stay connected with their mentors to talk about their feelings and get practical suggestions on what to do.\"\nIf bullying is conducted online, for example, Apex suggests young people should unfollow and report the bully or speak out. If someone is being taunted in person, a bystander could stand beside them for moral support or help the victim leave the scene. If they feel comfortable, they could speak out - but focus on the idea or behaviour, not the instigator of the attack.\nApex also encourages young people to point out that the coronavirus pandemic has nothing to do with ethnicity, or, if they know the person, engage in a conversation, Chung says. They are also encouraged to take care of themselves by exercising regularly, meditating, or finding a creative outlet through which to channel their emotions.\nApex has worked with thousands of students of Chinese, Korean, Japanese and South Asian descent since it was founded in New York in 1992 by dentist Alex Tsui and four of his Asian-American friends. Their aim was to help families from similar ethnic and cultural backgrounds to theirs.\nApex mentors are carefully chosen in a rigorous process that includes several interviews; Jason's mentor, 28-year-old Elvin Yuen, says it took at least six months for him to be accepted. All mentors are trained and then matched with young people with similar backgrounds, interests and goals.\nYuen, a banker who was born in Hong Kong and grew up in Manhattan, says Jason was upset by the bat soup video incident, which happened before the city was locked down. \"He fell silent because he didn't know what to say about the woman eating bat soup,\" Yuen says. \"These things are happening, but we have to stay educated and try to defuse the situation.\"\nJason, who says he has experienced racism from an early age, later suggested that Apex run workshops to specifically address bullying fuelled by the pandemic.\n\"I grew up in Spanish Harlem, where there are different minorities. People would make slitty eyes or say 'Ching Chong' at me,\" Jason recalls. \"When I went into kindergarten, I only knew like three words in English, and so when I said something in Chinese everyone looked at me weird.\"\nBy the time he was 10, Jason's reaction to xenophobic taunts got him into fights. Two years later, he learned about Apex from his mother's social worker. He initially thought it was a place where studious Asians did their homework after school, but quickly discovered it was more about being able to talk to an adult who could relate to him, attend workshops on issues such as Asian identity and bullying, and go on trips.\nJason plans to become a paediatrician \"because the salary is more appealing than being a teacher\". Yuen says the teenager is becoming more studious, and is practising for the SAT exams to get into university and then medical school.\nThe mentoring experience has been \"very rewarding\", Yuen says. \"Jason is focused on his schoolwork and his goals of where he wants to end up. I gave him a heads-up about working with kids and suggested he apply to be a summer camp counsellor.\"\nAsked if he feels more Chinese or American, Jason thinks for a minute and replies in Cantonese, jook sing, or \"overseas Chinese\". \"I feel Chinese, but when I'm in China my Chinese is so bad,\" he says. \"But I like being Chinese.\"\nPreeti Sriratana, 43, chairman of the Apex board, was also troubled as a child. He was born in Chicago and raised by Thai immigrant parents in Normal, Illinois, where he was bullied and struggled at school. Encouraged by his grandmother and teachers, Sriratana pursued his studies and graduated with a master's degree in architecture from Columbia University. He is now a partner and managing director of a New York-based architectural firm.\n\"The mentoring gives children an opportunity to ask questions they can't ask their parents, or if their parents don't know the system. This relationship is so important,\" he says.\nIn 2001, he\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JASON CHEN WEIPING<|>PERSON<|>Jason Chen Weiping is a 16-year-old student who experienced bullying related to his Asian heritage and is involved with the non-profit organization Apex for Youth.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APEX FOR YOUTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apex for Youth is a non-profit organization that provides workshops and mentoring for school-age Asian-Americans from disadvantaged backgrounds in New York.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is the city where Jason Chen Weiping lives and where Apex for Youth operates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAISHAN<|>GEO<|>Taishan is a city in Guangdong province, China, where Jason Chen Weiping was born.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUANGDONG<|>GEO<|>Guangdong province is a coastal province in southern China, known for its economic development and cultural diversity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAU<|>GEO<|>Palau is an island country in Micronesia where a video related to the bat soup incident was filmed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICRONESIA<|>GEO<|>Micronesia is a region in the western Pacific Ocean comprising thousands of small islands, including Palau.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that began in late 2019 and has led to increased discrimination against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is a city in China where the first cluster of COVID-19 cases was reported in late December 2019.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELVIN YUEN<|>PERSON<|>Elvin Yuen is a 28-year-old banker and mentor at Apex for Youth who supports Jason Chen Weiping.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIYOON MARY CHUNG<|>PERSON<|>Jiyoon Mary Chung is the interim executive director of Apex for Youth, involved in addressing issues of bullying and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PREETI SRIRATANA<|>PERSON<|>Preeti Sriratana is the chairman of the Apex board, who has a background in architecture and personal experience with bullying.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JASON CHEN WEIPING<|>APEX FOR YOUTH<|>Jason is involved with Apex for Youth, which provides support and mentoring to him<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APEX FOR YOUTH<|>NEW YORK<|>Apex for Youth operates in New York, providing services to local Asian-American youth<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JASON CHEN WEIPING<|>ELVIN YUEN<|>Elvin Yuen is Jason's mentor at Apex for Youth, guiding him through personal challenges<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JIYOON MARY CHUNG<|>APEX FOR YOUTH<|>Jiyoon Mary Chung is the interim executive director of Apex for Youth, overseeing its programs<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PREETI SRIRATANA<|>APEX FOR YOUTH<|>Preeti Sriratana is the chairman of the Apex board, contributing to the organization's mission<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK<|>COVID-19<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected communities in New York, leading to increased discrimination<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>WUHAN<|>COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, leading to a global pandemic<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JASON CHEN WEIPING<|>TAISHAN<|>Jason was born in Taishan, Guangdong province, before emigrating to the US<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JASON CHEN WEIPING<|>PALAU<|>The video incident involving Jason was related to a video filmed in Palau, not China<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PALAU<|>MICRONESIA<|>Palau is an island country located in the region of Micronesia<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUANGDONG<|>TAISHAN<|>Taishan is a city located in Guangdong province, China<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
