The organization focuses on plastics-related policy research and Zou works on the CEF website.\nRecently, Zou received a package from the Chinese embassy in Washington that contained protective KN95 and surgical masks, medications, sanitizing wipes and a brochure to help Chinese students stay healthy in the US.\nShe also received a gift bag including fresh fruit and snacks from her supervisor, Jennifer Turner, director of the CEF, with a message expressing her hope that the interns stay strong amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"I was moved to tears a little as my heart was warmed by such care and solicitude, and by not feeling isolated and lonely anymore,\" Zou said.\n\"At the beginning of this pandemic, Jennifer asked me about the situation of my family and the city they live in, and she also wanted to make donations to Chinese people. My heart felt the warmth of her kindness and caring.\"\nZou is grateful that she has a professional, friendly and active work environment, especially as discrimination toward Chinese in the US has been present since the outbreak began.\nShe said she felt depressed when she saw Chinese people and Asian Americans being subjected to racist attacks on Twitter.\n\"I think it's time for the two countries to come together instead of blaming each other. The US and China need more mutual cooperation on global challenges,\" said Zou.\nShe learned that some of her colleagues volunteered amid the pandemic.\n\"One of my colleagues made masks with her tiny sewing machine and then donated them to community workers, cleaners and couriers,\" Zou said. \"And another colleague, who preferred to cook at home before, decided to order takeout more frequently to support local restaurants.\n\"I felt really encouraged by their experiences and also wanted to support the people around me.\"\nZou found the hospital closest to her, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, and registered her donation information.\nOn April 28, Zou, with another classmate, donated all of her KN95 masks and three bags of disinfectant wipes to the hospital.\n\"At this time, I think front-line medical workers who are (more vulnerable to) COVID-19 should be protected more than us,\" Zou said. \"I feel really happy since I have an opportunity to contribute to the common good, even though I'm not that strong.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ZOU YINING<|>PERSON<|>Zou Yining is a second-year graduate student from China at Georgetown University who is actively helping others during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Georgetown University is an educational institution in the United States where Zou Yining is pursuing her graduate studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA ENVIRONMENT FORUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The China Environment Forum (CEF) is a think tank at the Wilson Center focusing on plastics-related policy research, where Zou Yining interns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILSON CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Wilson Center is a think tank in Washington DC that houses the China Environment Forum.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE EMBASSY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese embassy in Washington provides support to Chinese students in the US, including sending protective supplies during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDSTAR GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MedStar Georgetown University Hospital is the hospital where Zou Yining donated protective supplies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENNIFER TURNER<|>PERSON<|>Jennifer Turner is the director of the China Environment Forum who supports her interns during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has affected individuals and communities worldwide, prompting acts of kindness and support.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is the country where Zou Yining studies and where the COVID-19 pandemic has led to discrimination against Chinese individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is the home country of Zou Yining and many other students studying in the United States.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZOU YINING<|>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY<|>Zou Yining is a graduate student at Georgetown University, where she is studying during the pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZOU YINING<|>CHINA ENVIRONMENT FORUM<|>Zou Yining interns at the China Environment Forum, contributing to their research and activities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZOU YINING<|>JENNIFER TURNER<|>Jennifer Turner is Zou Yining's supervisor at the China Environment Forum, providing support during the pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZOU YINING<|>MEDSTAR GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL<|>Zou Yining donated protective supplies to MedStar Georgetown University Hospital to support front-line workers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE EMBASSY<|>ZOU YINING<|>The Chinese embassy sent protective supplies to Zou Yining to help her and other Chinese students during the pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE EMBASSY<|>UNITED STATES<|>The Chinese embassy operates in the United States to support Chinese nationals living there<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZOU YINING<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Zou Yining is actively helping others during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the impact of the event on her actions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY<|>WILSON CENTER<|>Georgetown University and the Wilson Center are both institutions in Washington DC, contributing to research and education<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>UNITED STATES<|>China and the United States are countries that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to calls for cooperation<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
