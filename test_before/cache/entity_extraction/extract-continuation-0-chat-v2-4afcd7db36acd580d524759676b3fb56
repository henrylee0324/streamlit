Hundreds of Asian Americans have reported verbal and physical assaults since the nation's first infections surfaced in January. Even in cities with large Asian communities, people have hurled century-old slurs like “Chinaman.\"\nDaniel Dae Kim, a Korean American actor known for TV's “Lost\" and “Hawaii Five-0,\" faced racist trolling when he shared his COVID-19 diagnosis on Instagram in March. Kim, who narrates the documentary with actress Tamlyn Tomita, has recovered and feels \"back to 100%.”\n“It’s been very eye-opening to see how much prejudice still exists in America and how deep seated it seems to be. But it’s part of the price one pays for speaking out, even against something as seemingly universal as injustice,” Kim said in an email to The Associated Press.\nThe five-episode series airing between Monday and Tuesday is a sweeping look at Asian Americans' impact on society, politics and pop culture from the mid-19th century through 9/11. Produced by Asian American filmmakers, the show features reflections from U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, “Fresh Off the Boat” star Randall Park and a host of people from other industries. There are also interviews with descendants whose family stories are heavily featured.\nMay is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, when Asians' contributions to the American landscape are often highlighted.\nThe virus-related attacks, however, have been a stark reminder of how quickly Asian Americans can go from neighbor to scapegoat. In a Los Angeles Times editorial last month, Korean American actor John Cho wrote how “belonging is conditional. One moment we are Americans, the next we are all foreigners, who ‘brought’ the virus here.”\nThat anti-Asian sentiment is all the more reason the documentary needs to be seen now, Kim said.\n“Those who forget history are condemned to repeat it,” Kim said. “Asian Americans have a unique history in America. It’s one that should be celebrated as an indispensable part of our nation’s history.”\nRenee Tajima-Peña, a series producer and professor of Asian American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, had the monumental task of deciding how to fit decades of history into just five hours. She began with the arrival of Chinese railroad workers in the 1800s.\n“We start at a time where we can still find people, if they’re descendants, with pictures and photographs,” Tajima-Peña said. “On the one hand, there was choosing which stories we felt were most important to tell. On the other hand, it’s TV. We have to make sure it’s something that’s watchable and the audience can engage with.”\nThe series covers well-known events like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the World War II internment of Japanese Americans and the 1982 beating death of Vincent Chin in Detroit.\nBut it also delves into lesser-known moments, like a 1965 labor strike organized by Filipino farmworkers in California, and spotlights people you may not recognize, like Patsy Mink, a Japanese American who in 1964 was the first woman of color elected to Congress.\nThere's also an interview with Tereza Lee, who inspired the now-stalled DREAM Act that would have given a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\nComedian Hari Kondabolu, known for his documentary “The Problem With Apu,” speaks in the series about post-9/11 treatment of Muslim Americans and Southeast Asian Americans. The coronavirus-related racism has drawn comparison to that time.\nLike Kondabolu did in 2001, many young Asian Americans are now facing outright hate for the first time.\n“I had never been targeted the way I had been in 9/11. That shaped how I viewed this country,” he said at a virtual town hall last week. \"The generation after 9/11 ... they’re gonna have to question where we are now. It’s going to inform how they will see the world.”\nHe's glad that the challenges and prejudices Asian Americans have faced for more than a century are enshrined in a documentary.\n“Once it’s on PBS, it feels like an official document,\" Kondabalu said in an earlier interview. “This marks our place in the history of this country. It wasn’t there before.”\nTajima-Peña wouldn’t alter the episodes to address the pandemic if she could, saying viewers will inevitably connect it to present-day xenophobia. It's a “new story that really is an old story.\"\n“The whole COVID crisis, it’s really just amplified all the fault lines in the United States of race and class, poverty, health care. In terms of Asian Americans, of course, it’s this idea we’re so-called foreigners,” she said.\nOne of her hopes is the series will inspire younger Asian Americans to think beyond social media rants to activism.\n“Our backs are against the walls. How do we move forward together? That’s what you see in the series,\" Tajima-Peña said. \"Asian Americans had to come together to defend our own rights.”\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PBS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PBS is a public broadcasting service that produced the documentary series “Asian Americans” which explores the history and impact of Asian Americans in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>EVENT<|>The documentary series “Asian Americans” is a five-episode exploration of the contributions and challenges faced by Asian Americans throughout history.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANIEL DAE KIM<|>PERSON<|>Daniel Dae Kim is a Korean American actor known for his roles in “Lost” and “Hawaii Five-0,” who narrates the documentary series and shares his experiences with racism during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMLYN TOMITA<|>PERSON<|>Tamlyn Tomita is an actress who co-narrates the documentary series “Asian Americans.”)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMMY DUCKWORTH<|>PERSON<|>Tammy Duckworth is a U.S. Senator featured in the documentary series, providing reflections on Asian Americans' impact on society.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANDALL PARK<|>PERSON<|>Randall Park is an actor known for his role in “Fresh Off the Boat,” who is featured in the documentary series.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENÉE TAJIMA-PEÑA<|>PERSON<|>Renee Tajima-Peña is a series producer and professor of Asian American studies at UCLA, responsible for the documentary series “Asian Americans.”)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>PERSON<|>Vincent Chin was a victim of a racially motivated beating in 1982, an event covered in the documentary series.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEREZA LEE<|>PERSON<|>Tereza Lee is an individual featured in the documentary who inspired the DREAM Act aimed at providing citizenship paths for undocumented youth.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARI KONDABOLU<|>PERSON<|>Hari Kondabolu is a comedian and filmmaker known for his documentary “The Problem With Apu,” who discusses the treatment of Asian Americans in the series.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has exacerbated anti-Asian sentiment and racism, as discussed in the documentary series.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT<|>EVENT<|>The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 is a significant historical event covered in the documentary series, highlighting discrimination against Chinese immigrants.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>9/11<|>EVENT<|>The events of September 11, 2001, are referenced in the documentary series as a time of increased discrimination against Asian Americans, particularly Muslims and Southeast Asians.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANIEL DAE KIM<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Daniel Dae Kim narrates the documentary series “Asian Americans,” sharing his personal experiences and insights<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAMLYN TOMITA<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Tamlyn Tomita co-narrates the documentary series “Asian Americans,” contributing to its storytelling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAMMY DUCKWORTH<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Tammy Duckworth is featured in the documentary series, providing reflections on the impact of Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RANDALL PARK<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Randall Park is featured in the documentary series, discussing Asian American contributions to society<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RENÉE TAJIMA-PEÑA<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Renee Tajima-Peña is the producer of the documentary series “Asian Americans,” overseeing its creation<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Vincent Chin's story is highlighted in the documentary series as a pivotal moment in Asian American history<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEREZA LEE<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Tereza Lee is featured in the documentary series for her role in inspiring the DREAM Act<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARI KONDABOLU<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Hari Kondabolu discusses the post-9/11 treatment of Asian Americans in the documentary series<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a central theme in the documentary series, illustrating the resurgence of anti-Asian sentiment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The Chinese Exclusion Act is discussed in the documentary series as a historical example of discrimination against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>9/11<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The events of 9/11 are referenced in the documentary series to highlight the discrimination faced by Asian Americans during that time<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
