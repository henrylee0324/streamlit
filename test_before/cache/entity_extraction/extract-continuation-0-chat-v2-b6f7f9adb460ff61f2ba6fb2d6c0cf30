Patty Kim, D-Dauphin County, has served the 103rd district since 2013 and is a former Harrisburg city councilwoman. She\nsaid she has been concerned that many hateful incidents against Asian-Americans were going unreported.\n\"Growing up, I've had kids calling me names and pointing out I'm different. I thought that was the way of life,\" Kim said. \"People feel\nvery bad and embarrassed, and just want it to go away.\"\n\"I want to encourage people of any race when you hear these kinds of comments and actions they should be reported and documented\nto the Human Relations Commission and PA Attorney General,\" she said.\nKim said she's glad more people are taking notice of discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\"We need a culture shift. We don't need to tolerate this,\" she said.\nRural racism\nAlthough a lot of the recent coverage has concentrated on cities such as San Francisco and New York, in more rural areas, this\ndynamic can often be worse.\n\"Moving from Philadelphia to Central PA, I've experienced more microaggressions, more bias, more hate,\" Hartman said, recalling\nbeing asked to leave a party where a Confederate flag was being displayed and being shouted at with racist epithets while drinking a\nmilkshake at the Pennsylvania Farm Show.\nAs a leader at the Central PA Korean Association, Hartman said organizations like hers could help connect people that may have never\nmet an Asian-American person before.\n\"There are individuals who have gone their entire life not having a close friend or a colleague who's Asian, and all they're hearing is\nabout Asian-Americans being viruses, or the carriers of disease, or invaders, or taking jobs away,\" she said.\n\"In smaller, rural towns that are predominantly one race, one culture, maybe you don't have other cultures coming in....I think\nthere's so many opportunities in this globally networked world to break from that.\"\nThe bigotry can take on both overt and less obvious characters, particularly surrounding the coronavirus.\n\"You see people walk away from us in the grocery store,\" Kim said. \"It's hard to prove, it's subtle, but I believe it's happening....I've\nexperienced that a couple times but don't know what they were thinking of.\"\nKim said that larger cities with more diversity were able to pick up on patterns of racism more quickly.\nHartman said she was the only teacher of color when teaching at high schools in Central Pennsylvania and experienced\nmicroaggressions.\nRomanoff said his mother had also been subject to racial bigotry from students at Central Pennsylvania schools when she was a\nteacher, with students telling her to \"go back to China\" and mimicking slanted eyes.\nHis mother came as a chemist, but there is a false belief that Asian immigrants are taking jobs, he said.\n\"A lot of Filipinos feel like they have to dumb down their resumes just to get hired,\" he added.\nRomanoff said he was harassed as a kid by people saying he would be deported if an election was won by Ross Perot, a former\nbusiness executive who mounted two third-party presidential bids on anti-free trade and nativist themes in the 1990s.\n\"It makes me sick,\" Romanoff said. \"America is supposed to be a country of freedom.
