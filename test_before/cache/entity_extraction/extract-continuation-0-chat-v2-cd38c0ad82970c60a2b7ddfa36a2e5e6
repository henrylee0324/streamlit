I've never felt afraid to leave my home to take out the trash bc of my face.\nAttacks have also gotten physical.\nIn the San Fernando Valley in California, a 16-year old Asian-American boy was attacked in school by bullies who accused him of having the coronavirus. He was sent to\nthe emergency room to see whether he had a concussion.\nIn New York City a woman wearing a mask was kicked and punched in a Manhattan subway station, and a man in Queens was followed to a bus stop, shouted at and\nthen hit over the head in front of his 10-year-old son.\nPeople have rushed to protect themselves. One man started a buddy-system Facebook group for Asians in New York who are afraid to take the subway by themselves.\nGun shop owners in the Washington, D.C., area said they were seeing a surge of first-time Chinese-American buyers.\nAt Engage Armament in Rockville, Md., most gun buyers in the first two weeks of March have been Chinese-American or Chinese, according to the owner, Andy\nRaymond.\nMore than a fifth of Rockville's residents are of Asian ethnicity, and Mr. Raymond said buyers from Korean and Vietnamese backgrounds were not unusual. But Mr.\nRaymond said he was stunned by the flow of Chinese customers -- in particular green-card holders from mainland China -- that began earlier this month, a group that\nrarely patronized his shop before.\nIt was just nonstop, something I've never seen, he said.\nMr. Raymond said that few of the Asian customers wanted to talk about why they were there, but when one of his employees asked a woman about it, she teared up. To\nprotect my daughter, she replied.\nFor recent immigrants like Mr. Du who are in close touch with friends and family in China, the virus has been a screaming danger for weeks that most Americans seemed\noblivious to.\nMr. Du is trying to remain hopeful. He spends his weekends training to become a volunteer with Maryland's emergency medical workers. He is part of a group of\nChinese-American scientists who organized a GoFundMe account to raise money for protective gear for hospital workers in the area. In three days, they raised more\nthan $55,000, nearly all in small donations.\nBut he said he was afraid of the chaos that could be unleashed if the United States death toll rises significantly.\nAlready a gun owner, Mr. Du, 48, said he was in the process of buying an AR-15-style rifle.\nKatrina is not far away, he said, alluding to the unrest in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. And when all these bad things come, I am a minority.\nPeople can see my face is Chinese, clearly. My son, when he goes out, they will know his parents are Chinese.\nFor American-born Asians, there is a sudden sense of being watched that is as unsettling as it is unfamiliar.\nIt's a look of disdain, said Chil Kong, a Korean-American theater director in Maryland. It's just 'How dare you exist in my world You are a reminder of this disease,\nand you don't belong in my world.'\nHe added It's especially hard when you grow up here and expect this world to be yours equally. But we do not live in that world anymore. That world does not exist.\nOne debate among Asian-Americans has been over whether to wear a mask in public. Wearing one risks drawing unwanted attention; but not wearing one does, too. Ms.\nZhu said her parents, who live in China, offered to ship her some.\nI'm like, 'Oh please, don't,' she said. She said she was afraid of getting physically attacked if she wore one. Lots of my friends, their social media posts are all about\nthis We don't wear masks. It's kind of more dangerous than the virus.\nA 30-year-old videographer in Syracuse, N.Y., said he was still shaken from a trip to the grocery store last week, when the man ahead of him in the checkout line\nshouted at him, It's you people who brought the disease, and other customers just stared at him, without offering to help. That same day, he said, two couples\nverbally abused him at Costco.\nI feel like I'm being invaded by this hatred, said the man, Edward, who asked that his last name not be used because he feared attracting more attention. It's\neverywhere. It's silent. It's as deadly as this disease.\nHe said he had tried to hide the details of what happened from his mother, who moved to the United States from China in the 1970s. But there was one thing he did tell\nher.\nI told her, whatever you do, you can't go shopping, he said. She needed to know there's a problem and we can't act like it's normal anymore.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JIAYANG FAN<|>PERSON<|>Jiayang Fan is a writer for The New Yorker who expressed her feelings about being targeted for her ethnicity in a recent incident.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDWARD<|>PERSON<|>Edward is a 30-year-old videographer who experienced verbal abuse related to his ethnicity and is concerned about the safety of his mother.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDY RAYMOND<|>PERSON<|>Andy Raymond is the owner of Engage Armament in Rockville, Md., who noted a surge in gun purchases among Chinese-American customers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DU<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Du is a recent immigrant who is training to become a volunteer with Maryland's emergency medical workers and is concerned about the dangers posed by the virus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATRINA<|>EVENT<|>Katrina refers to the unrest in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which is mentioned as a concern for future chaos.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FERNANDO VALLEY<|>GEO<|>San Fernando Valley is a region in California where an Asian-American boy was attacked in school.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is where a woman was attacked in a subway station and where a buddy-system Facebook group for Asians was started.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROCKVILLE<|>GEO<|>Rockville is a city in Maryland where gun shop owners reported a surge in first-time Chinese-American buyers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYRACUSE<|>GEO<|>Syracuse is a city in New York where Edward experienced verbal abuse in a grocery store.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JIAYANG FAN<|>EDWARD<|>Both Jiayang Fan and Edward have experienced discrimination and fear related to their ethnicity in the United States<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDY RAYMOND<|>DU<|>Andy Raymond noted a significant increase in gun purchases among Chinese-American customers, which reflects the concerns of individuals like Mr. Du<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DU<|>KATRINA<|>Mr. Du referenced the potential for chaos similar to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, indicating a fear of societal unrest<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDWARD<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>Edward's experiences of verbal abuse are part of a broader pattern of discrimination occurring in urban areas like New York City<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDWARD<|>SAN FERNANDO VALLEY<|>Both Edward and the Asian-American boy in San Fernando Valley experienced physical and verbal attacks due to their ethnicity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>ROCKVILLE<|>The surge in gun purchases in Rockville reflects a response to the discrimination and fear experienced by Asian-Americans in cities like New York<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
