Worse still, she was told that if she\ncouldn't pay this month's rent, she'd be evicted or pay extra the following month. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan she had\napplied for with the help of an agent was only a temporary Band-Aid. She feels that all her effort coming to America looks increasingly\nlike a bubble about to burst.\nLirong Ma's designer clothing store is one of three dozen businesses in Atlanta's Chinatown. Standing quietly near the old freight tracks\nin Chamblee, this Chinatown is not exactly a town, but a small strip mall with beige walls, green roof tiles, and red signage. Opened on\nAug. 8, 1988, it was said to be the first Chinese commercial center in the southeastern U.S. Two stone lions guard its front entrance.\nChinese immigrants began to arrive in Atlanta in significant numbers after the U.S. immigration law was revised in 1965, a fruit of the\ncivil rights movement. Jimmy Carter, a former Georgia farmer and governor and the 39th president of the United States, formally\nnormalized diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, heralding a new era of China's economic boom and U.S.-\nChina exchanges.\nFour decades later, however, it would not be an exaggeration to say that U.S.-China relations are hitting a new low. Lately, the two\ncountries' top leaders have played tit-for-tat in trade wars and each has recently closed consulates in the other's country. President\nDonald Trump has blamed China for letting the coronavirus pandemic get out of control, and the administration has imposed visa\nrestrictions for foreign workers and international students. Most recently, Trump signed two executive orders to ban Tik-Tok, a popular\nvideo-sharing social networking service, and WeChat, the most widely used messaging app among the Chinese.\nMany Chinese living in the United States find themselves stuck in the middle of this U.S.-China rivalry in the time of COVID-19, quietly\ncoping with financial distress, visa restrictions, racial discrimination, public health fears and crises of personal identity.\nI grew up in mainland China in the 1990s and 2000s, and first heard about Atlanta when it hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics. Since I\nmoved to Atlanta in 2016, I've regularly swum in the pool used for the Olympics, and sported a Carter-Mondale bumper sticker on the\nrear of my 1976 vintage car.\nAbout twice a month, I drive my light-yellow diesel car from my home in Midtown to Buford Highway. I pass a small airport, a vibrant\nLatino neighborhood, a few Buddhist temples, a MARTA station, and arrive at the Chinatown on New Peachtree Road. Lately, new\ndevelopments with a Ponce City Market vibe are sprouting nearby.\nI go there to find niche cooking ingredients and affordable packaged food at Dinho Supermarket, grab a bite in the food court, and chat\nwith different store owners. Unlike the sprawling Chinatowns in New York or San Francisco, Atlanta Chinatown's quiet space, small\ngarden, and friendly air put me at ease. When I walk through the crammed aisles and smell shampoo and soap, I remember my\nchildhood.\n'Responsibility\nto serve my community' Since it bears the name Chinatown -- the one and only in metro Atlanta -- Chamblee Chinatown remains the\ndestination for many Chinese newcomers. A store owner once told me that when Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017, many displaced\nChinese families drove north, searched for Chinatown, and arrived here, where the shop owners sheltered and fed them. Chinese people\nfrom Kentucky, Tennessee and other neighboring states also make seasonal pilgrimages to Atlanta Chinatown, curing their homesickness\nwith trunkloads of goods.\nWhile the name Chinatown brings Chinese people together in times of need, it has also become a target for racial alienation.\n\"Because of the sign Chinatown on top of our building, people stopped coming here as early as late January, when Wuhan just entered\nlockdown but America was still business as usual,\" one female shop owner, who wished to withhold her name fearing further alienation,\ntold me. \"They don't know that many who work here are not Chinese, don't speak any Chinese, and have never been to China.\"\nAlthough this woman's shop is on the brink of bankruptcy, what she fears more is publicity. \"I know my business is suffering, but I feel\nvery, very tired. I just want to protect my family at this moment, and don't want to invite any more attention.\" A single mother, she\nspoke gently but resolutely. At the end of May, a small group of protesters came to Atlanta Chinatown to boycott the Chinese businesses.\nOne protester carried a gun. This left her and the Chinese community shaken.\nYet she does what she can to help those less fortunate. She has set up a food counter in the corner of her shop for homeless people to\ntake canned food, toothbrushes, toilet paper and other daily necessities.\n\"When homeless people come by, none of them take more than they need, even when I offer more,\" she recalled with light in her eyes.\n\"Perhaps I do feel a responsibility to serve my community.\"\nRestaurants hit hard Dinho Supermarket, standing since 1988 and now run by\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LIRONG MA<|>PERSON<|>Lirong Ma is a 67-year-old tailor shop owner from Harbin, struggling with her business due to the pandemic and financial difficulties.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARBIN<|>GEO<|>Harbin is a city in northeastern China, known for its cold winters and as the hometown of Lirong Ma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA CHINATOWN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Atlanta Chinatown is a small commercial center in Chamblee, Georgia, established in 1988, serving the Chinese community and newcomers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is a loan initiative designed to help businesses maintain their workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAMBLEE<|>GEO<|>Chamblee is a city in Georgia, home to Atlanta's Chinatown, which is a small strip mall with various Chinese businesses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. IMMIGRATION LAW<|>EVENT<|>The U.S. immigration law revision in 1965 allowed significant numbers of Chinese immigrants to arrive in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIMMY CARTER<|>PERSON<|>Jimmy Carter is a former Georgia farmer, governor, and the 39th president of the United States, known for normalizing relations with China in 1979.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread health and economic issues, affecting businesses and communities globally, including Atlanta's Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HURRICANE IRMA<|>EVENT<|>Hurricane Irma was a powerful hurricane that hit Florida in 2017, leading many displaced Chinese families to seek refuge in Atlanta Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINHO SUPERMARKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dinho Supermarket is a grocery store in Atlanta Chinatown, known for providing niche cooking ingredients and affordable food.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIRONG MA<|>ATLANTA CHINATOWN<|>Lirong Ma's tailor shop is located in Atlanta Chinatown, which has been significantly impacted by the pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARBIN<|>LIRONG MA<|>Lirong Ma hails from Harbin, which is her place of origin<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA CHINATOWN<|>PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM<|>Businesses in Atlanta Chinatown, including Lirong Ma's, have applied for the PPP to cope with financial struggles<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHAMBLEE<|>ATLANTA CHINATOWN<|>Atlanta Chinatown is located in Chamblee, Georgia<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>U.S. IMMIGRATION LAW<|>ATLANTA CHINATOWN<|>The revision of U.S. immigration law in 1965 led to the establishment of Atlanta Chinatown as a hub for Chinese immigrants<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JIMMY CARTER<|>U.S. IMMIGRATION LAW<|>Jimmy Carter's presidency and normalization of relations with China in 1979 influenced immigration patterns and community establishment<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>ATLANTA CHINATOWN<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected businesses in Atlanta Chinatown, leading to financial distress<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HURRICANE IRMA<|>ATLANTA CHINATOWN<|>Hurricane Irma caused many displaced Chinese families to seek refuge in Atlanta Chinatown<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINHO SUPERMARKET<|>ATLANTA CHINATOWN<|>Dinho Supermarket is a key business within Atlanta Chinatown, serving the local community<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
