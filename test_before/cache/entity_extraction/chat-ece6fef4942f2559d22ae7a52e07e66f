Them.\nThe very words sound sinister. No wonder they became the titles of horror movies.\nBut they're what we focus on, in a time of fear. Prejudice could be the one thing that spreads more easily than COVID-19.\n\"In an epidemic, a lot of feelings get very primitive,\" said psychologist and psychoanalyst Spyros D. Orfanos. \"People get very fearful and xenophobic. They need to externalize the blame. They need to find somebody who is at fault for this.\"\nGroups that can be \"blamed\" for the epidemic — Asians in particular — have been reporting an uptick of bias incidents in the last two months. Groups that have been associated with a particular outbreak, such as Orthodox Jews, have reported the same.\nEven the best of us — as we heroically come together to fight a common enemy — are liable to regard our fellow beings with just a wee bit of suspicion.\nWe worry about The Other — the neighbor we cross the street to avoid, the person in the store we back away from.\nAnd we worry, especially, about people seen as apart from the community — the ones whose ways are unfamiliar, and whose motives are suspect. Them.\n\"I think in general people are either consciously or unconsciously biased towards other races,\" said Orfanos, director of New York University's postdoctoral program in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. \"And whenever something unexpected or fearful happens, a threat that is unprecedented, it interferes with our thinking.\"\nUnlike the Others of \"The Others\" (2001) — ghosts — and the Them of \"Them!\" (1954) — giant ants — our other-ing of others right now has a superficial basis in truth. There is, in fact, a disease called COVID-19 that some of us are carrying.\nIt did originate in a particular country — as all diseases do — though that's pretty much academic, since it's now worldwide. And there have been cases of localized outbreaks connected with some particular groups (and many other outbreaks not connected with them).\nBut it's telling that the bias incidents tend to be aimed mostly at populations that are already stigmatized. Asians and Jews, in particular.\nThere's been an incident\nIncidents ranging from verbal harassment (67.3%) to physical assault (10%) to being coughed and spat on (2.7%) to being banned from public transportation (1.0%) have been reported by the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, which on April 3 cited over 1,100 reported incidents of anti-Asian bias nationally, clocked over a two-week period.\nOne such incident was recounted in a Los Angeles Times editorial: \"A white man on open sidewalk approached and stepped directly in front of me and coughed in extremely exaggerated manner in my face — loudly, mouth wide open, about 2 feet from my face, said 'take my virus.'\"\nThere are other such reports. The Asian woman who was punched on West 34th Street by another woman who made anti-Asian slurs (March 10). The man in the New York subway who sprayed air freshener at an Asian passenger (Feb. 6). The Asian student attacked in London by four men who told him, \"We don't want your coronavirus in our country\" (Feb. 24).\nMembers of the Orthodox Jewish community also started to worry, when an outbreak originating in a New Rochelle synagogue led in March to a \"containment area\" around the town.\n\"We're seeing stuff online,\" Evan Bernstein, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Northeast Division, told the The Journal News and lohud.com on March 4. \"We're getting more and more reports of those comments.\"\nIn Lakewood, tensions have flared between Orthodox Jews — there have been a few cases of weddings held, in violation of rules banning large gatherings — and the rest of the community. A local petition to shut Lakewood down was condemned by Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\"Scapegoating, bullying, or vilification of any community is completely unacceptable — today or ever,\" Murphy tweeted. \"There is a special place in hell for the small minority that do this during this crisis.\"\nA surge in anti-Semitic gibes, cartoons and conspiracy theories online, since the COVID crisis hit, has also been reported on the ADL website.\nThere seem to be two lines of thought, mutually exclusive: that Jews are more likely to have the disease, and that Jews are masterminds who somehow created it, for their own sinister reasons. A Wisconsin white supremacist named \"Uncle\" Paul Nehlen has floated the idea that COVID is a Jewish bioweapon, created in Israel, for the purpose of controlling China. \"You gonna let these jealous, vindictive jews get away with it?\" he posted on the messaging platform Telegram in January.\n\"I feel like I'm living in the middle ages,\" said American studies professor Michael Aaron Rockland of Rutgers. \"It's the mystery of this thing that has people scared.\"\nCoronabias\nThere are also milder forms of bias. The people, for instance, who avoided Chinese restaurants — back when you could still go to restaurants — for what they would say are rational reasons. After all, COVID-19 did originate in China, right? And you don't really know where the waiter might be from, right?\nActually there's no more reason to think that a person of Chinese ancestry had just visited Wuhan than a person of Swedish ancestry had just visited Stockholm. Still, business was down 70% in New York's Chinatown, the trade magazine Restaurant Hospitality reported in March.\nBut no one reported a comparable downtick in Italian restaurants. Not even in late March, when Italy's death toll surpassed China's, with as many as 250 people dying in a day. No one worried about whether Mario, at the pizzeria\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
