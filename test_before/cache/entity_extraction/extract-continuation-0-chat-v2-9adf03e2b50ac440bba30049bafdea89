A man attacked him by slamming into him.\nThe elderly man died of a brain haemorrhage a few days later.\nPeng Wang, a Chinese academic in Southampton, England, was out jogging in February when he was assaulted by four white men who yelled at him to \"go home\" before punching\nand kicking him. In Paris, a Japanese citizen was attacked by acid-throwing thugs.\nThe news these days is filled with upsetting stories like these, with equally discouraging statistics. Britain reported a 21 per cent increase in hate crimes against Asians last May\nduring the coronavirus crisis. In a recent survey, one in five Chinese-Australians say they have been a target of racially based attacks in the past year. And in the United States,\npolice departments and community groups are creating task forces to deal with a surge in racial attacks against Asians.\nLike many Hongkongers reading about these terrible incidents, I am shocked and concerned about the recent surge in anti-Asian attacks, and I have been trying to come to an\nunderstanding about why they are happening now. I know that anti-Asian racism is nothing new in modern history – certainly not in Western countries such as the US.\nHere in Asia, we have had dark moments of racial strife – the violence against the Chinese community in Indonesia in 1998, and the racial discrimination faced by Koreans in Japan\ncome to mind.\nWhat all these moments in history have in common is that they were sparked by economic and political tension. When countries are at odds, and economic times are tough, it is\neasy to pin the blame on \"others\". People often become collateral damage.\nIn a world reeling from pandemic-related economic crises, people are looking for scapegoats. And China is an easy target, since Covid-19 was first reported in Wuhan. Last\nOctober, a Pew Research Centre survey found that 73 per cent of Americans – and 81 per cent of Australians – have an unfavourable view of China. This offers a clue to why there\nhas been a recent surge of anti-Asian racist hate crimes. That Thais, Japanese and even Koreans have found themselves the target of anti-Chinese sentiment points to another\nunfortunate racial issue that we Asians encounter in Western countries. Many Westerners cannot distinguish between, say, a Japanese or a Vietnamese. We are all \"Chinese\".\nHere in Hong Kong, we are not without blame when it comes to racial bias. We should be doing more to support equal opportunity in our South Asian community. The Hong Kong\nroots of ethnic Indians, Pakistanis and Nepalese families in many cases go back longer than that of recent arrivals in Hong Kong from the mainland. Yet many Hongkongers treat\nthem like foreigners.\nOn the other hand, in Hong Kong, we do have a strong bent towards meritocracy. Foreigners and Chinese alike come here for opportunities. Talent, not race, was the criteria for\nthe appointment of top Argentinian financier Nicolas Aguzin as head of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.\nLikewise, in the US, we are beginning to see the rise of an Asian-American meritocracy, with prominent members of the community becoming public figures and entering politics at\nthe highest level. Andrew Yang, of Chinese heritage, is a leading candidate for mayor of New York City. And the second-highest position in the country is held by Vice-President\nKamala Harris, who has South Asian roots.\nThese achievements give me hope that racial bias and hate crimes against Asians will become a rare thing. One way we can discourage racism is through education. The more you\nlearn about other peoples and cultures, the less likely you are to stereotype them all as dangerous \"others\".\nPerhaps the most important way to combat these surges of racism is to support leaders who do not use race as a tactic to divide the public. Political and national tensions are a\nfact of life. But when national leaders unjustly blame other countries, they are sowing bad seeds. And from those seeds grow bitter fruit such as the violence we are seeing in San\nFrancisco, Southampton and Paris.\nBernard Chan is convenor of the Executive Council\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old Thai man who was attacked while walking in San Francisco and later died from his injuries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PENG WANG<|>PERSON<|>Peng Wang is a Chinese academic who was assaulted while jogging in Southampton, England.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California where Vicha Ratanapakdee was attacked.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHAMPTON<|>GEO<|>Southampton is a city in England where Peng Wang was assaulted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS<|>GEO<|>Paris is a city in France where a Japanese citizen was attacked.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a pandemic that has led to increased racial tensions and hate crimes against Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>PERSON<|>Kamala Harris is the Vice-President of the United States with South Asian roots.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDREW YANG<|>PERSON<|>Andrew Yang is a candidate of Chinese heritage for mayor of New York City.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONG KONG<|>GEO<|>Hong Kong is a region where racial bias and discrimination issues are discussed, particularly against South Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NICOLAS AGUZIN<|>PERSON<|>Nicolas Aguzin is an Argentinian financier appointed as head of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing based on meritocracy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEW RESEARCH CENTRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pew Research Centre is an organization that conducts surveys, including one on American views of China.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was attacked in San Francisco, highlighting issues of racial violence in the city<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PENG WANG<|>SOUTHAMPTON<|>Peng Wang was assaulted in Southampton, indicating a rise in hate crimes in the area<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>COVID-19<|>The attack on a Japanese citizen in Paris is part of a broader trend of hate crimes linked to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>HONG KONG<|>Kamala Harris's position as Vice-President represents the rise of Asian-American figures in politics, including in Hong Kong<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDREW YANG<|>HONG KONG<|>Andrew Yang's candidacy reflects the increasing visibility of Asian-Americans in political roles, similar to dynamics in Hong Kong<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NICOLAS AGUZIN<|>HONG KONG<|>Nicolas Aguzin's appointment in Hong Kong is an example of meritocracy that transcends racial biases<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEW RESEARCH CENTRE<|>COVID-19<|>The Pew Research Centre's survey on American views of China is related to the racial tensions exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
