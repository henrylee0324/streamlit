There were a number of incidents early in the\npandemic which were not treated as that.”\nHe also vowed to reach out to communities that don’t have a positive relationship with the city officials and law\nenforcement in the hopes of encouraging residents to report hate crimes which he says are severely\nunderreported.\n“One employee told me the heartbreaking story about how he was assaulted,” said Yang. “The person followed\nhim out of the subway and punched him in the face after he got to the street level. He was injured and bruised\non his jaw. He was afraid to come to work for several days and then, even afterwards now, he’s afraid to ride\nthe subway.”\nHe said the final step would be to treat these crimes seriously\nYang also spent time with the owner of Xi’an Famous Foods, Jason Wang, who told him he used to operate 14\nlocations prior to the pandemic. Now, he only has eight. Although he’s currently allowed to serve customers\nindoors at a maximum of 35 percent capacity, he elected not to due to the extra staffing costs that would\nrequire.\nYang says his experience as a successful businessman can get the city on track.\n“We have to try to get this city back on its feet as quickly as possible in terms of widespread vaccination of\neveryone who needs it and then have a means of verifying people are vaccinated so we can feel safe in meeting\nin office buildings, restaurants, bars and theaters,” he said.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
