And Emily Koch, a 29-year-oldwho has performed leading roles in “Wicked” and “Waitress,” acknowledged, “I definitely needed the money.”Over and over, they said they hoped success in Pittsfield would lead to more jobs for theater artists elsewhere. “This has to work,” saidAlex Getlin, a 26-year-old New Yorker spending her third summer at Berkshire Theater Group, “so more theater can happen in the rest ofthe country and more of my friends can get back to work. But not everyone wanted to be part of this production. “They’re bold, and someone has to do it, but I don’t know that I wanted to be theguinea pig,” said Vishal Vaidya, one of three actors who declined an opportunity to be in the show. “My joke is, ‘Do I want to die doing“Godspell”?’”On the day of the first rehearsal, under an open-air tent in Stockbridge, there were rules to be learned even before the actors openedtheir scripts: one person in a bathroom at a time; music stands 6 feet apart; individually wrapped bagels; personal bins of Sharpies,sweat rags and sanitizer.Kate Maguire, the theater’s artistic director, choked up as she offered a few words of welcome: “At this time in history, someone had tobegin to tell the stories again.”And then they began to talk. About the pandemic. About the Black Lives Matter movement. About “Godspell.”“I’ve been alone in my apartment for four months, literally,” Filderman, 65, offered as a prompt and a confession. “I’m very nervousabout my life and my future.”Stories, which Filderman would later fashion into a prelude, began to flow. Zach Williams, a 28-year-old Texan, had been touring in“Aladdin” when the pandemic hit. Tim Jones, 24, had just moved to New York; he returned home to Pittsfield and took a job deliveringmasks and gowns to nursing homes.Kimberly Immanuel, 25, reflected on injustice. “I was sick of people staring at me as if I was the human incarnation of COVID-19 justbecause I’m Asian,” she said.Edwards spoke of theater as a path through despair. “When COVID started, I thought, I’m just going to give up — I had panic attacksfor days on end,” he said. “Art saved me.”A deafening thunderstorm brought an end to that day’s rehearsal.The show is being staged in a tent pitched on a gravel-and-asphalt parking lot beside the Berkshire Theater Group’s Colonial Theater,and that’s where most of the two-week rehearsal period took place.Three mornings a week, the actors shuttled to the Berkshire Medical Center for testing. There was rarely any wait — this is a ruralregion — so they simply drove under a canopy, rolled down the car windows and braced. Some shrugged, while others screamed;Hetsberger repeatedly yelled at the top of her lungs even before the swab hit her nose, saying doing so helped her endure the probe.Each day there were complications (not just the virus but also passing motorcycles, airplanes, rainstorms and bugs) and compromises.“At first, did I imagine all these masks and all these partitions? No,” Filderman said. “But I do now, and I think it’s going to be reallygood because it makes the actors feel safe and it’s going to make the audience feel safe.”To keep the actors apart, the wide, shallow stage is subdivided into 10 “home bases,” each with a seating element of a different height:a chair, a stepladder, a beanbag. Props are limited because none can be passed from actor to actor. Pandemic humor is built into thestaging — during the vaudevillian number “All for the Best,” Jesus and Judas brandish yardsticks, rather than canes, and measure thedistance between them.The audience will be small — under Massachusetts safety standards, outdoor performance venues are allowed to admit only 100 people,including cast and crew, so the theater is expecting to sell just 75 tickets a night, at $100 each. (Ordinarily, the theater stages itsbiggest shows in a 780-seat house.)The front row will be 25 feet from the stage, in accordance with the state’s protocols for performances involving singing. (The show’smusic does not require wind or brass instruments, which are also thought to pose a risk of droplet transmission.) Audience members willhave to submit to temperature checks before entering; parties will be seated at social distances from one another; and masks will bemandatory.Among those planning to brave the restrictions: Stephen Schwartz, the show’s songwriter, best known for “Wicked.” “I’m just delightedthat live theater is finding a way back,” he said, “albeit tentatively and cautiously, but finding a way at all.”The tensest moment came on the seventh day of rehearsals. It was a hot one — 86 degrees — and the show’s choreographer, GerryMcIntyre, was teaching the actors the steps for Koch’s big number, “Bless the Lord.”Jason Weixelman, in his seventh summer as a stage manager with Berkshire Theater Group, didn’t like what he was seeing. Weixelman,40, could never have imagined that a life in the theater would involve enforcing public health protocols just devised by the state ofMassachusetts, Actors’ Equity, and the theater itself. But now he was concerned that performers at the front of the stage were at riskfrom those at the back, and he told Filderman that the partitions they had been using to separate singers next to one another mightalso be needed to separate the rowsThe\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EMILY KOCH<|>PERSON<|>Emily Koch is a 29-year-old actress known for her leading roles in the musicals “Wicked” and “Waitress.”)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERKSHIRE THEATER GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Berkshire Theater Group is a theater organization in Pittsfield that is staging productions and providing jobs for theater artists.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PITTSFIELD<|>GEO<|>Pittsfield is a city where the Berkshire Theater Group is located and where theater artists hope to find more job opportunities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GODSPELL<|>EVENT<|>“Godspell” is a musical being staged by the Berkshire Theater Group, which involves actors rehearsing under specific health protocols due to the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATE MAGUIRE<|>PERSON<|>Kate Maguire is the artistic director of the Berkshire Theater Group who welcomed the actors at the first rehearsal.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILDERMAN<|>PERSON<|>Filderman is a 65-year-old actor who expressed feelings of nervousness about life and future during the rehearsal.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEPHEN SCHWARTZ<|>PERSON<|>Stephen Schwartz is the songwriter for “Wicked” and expressed delight that live theater is finding a way back.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERRY MCINTYRE<|>PERSON<|>Gerry McIntyre is the choreographer for the production of “Godspell.”)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JASON WEIXELMAN<|>PERSON<|>Jason Weixelman is a stage manager with Berkshire Theater Group who is concerned about the safety of performers during rehearsals.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMILY KOCH<|>BERKSHIRE THEATER GROUP<|>Emily Koch is performing in a production staged by the Berkshire Theater Group, which is providing her with a job opportunity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATE MAGUIRE<|>BERKSHIRE THEATER GROUP<|>Kate Maguire is the artistic director of the Berkshire Theater Group, overseeing the productions and welcoming actors<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILDERMAN<|>GODSPELL<|>Filderman is an actor rehearsing for the musical “Godspell” and shared personal reflections during the rehearsal<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEPHEN SCHWARTZ<|>GODSPELL<|>Stephen Schwartz is the songwriter for “Wicked,” and his involvement indicates a connection to the theater productions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERRY MCINTYRE<|>GODSPELL<|>Gerry McIntyre is the choreographer for “Godspell,” directly involved in the production<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JASON WEIXELMAN<|>BERKSHIRE THEATER GROUP<|>Jason Weixelman is a stage manager for the Berkshire Theater Group, ensuring the safety and organization of rehearsals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PITTSFIELD<|>BERKSHIRE THEATER GROUP<|>Berkshire Theater Group is located in Pittsfield, contributing to the local economy and job market for theater artists<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
