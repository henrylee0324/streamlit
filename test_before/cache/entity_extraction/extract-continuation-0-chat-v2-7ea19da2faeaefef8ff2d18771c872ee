An Indigenous community in New Mexico lacks adequate health care as the death toll mounts. A sick hospital worker in New Jersey frets about infecting others in her heavily populated neighborhood.As the country cries out for a vaccine and a return to normal, lost in the policy debates is the reality that COVID-19 kills far more people of color than white Americans. This isn't a matter of coincidence, poor choices or bad luck â€” it's by design.A team of USA TODAY reporters explored how the policies of the past and present have made Black, Asian, Hispanic and Indigenous Americans prime targets for COVID-19. They found:America's education and economic systems are still unequal, disproportionately leaving people of color out of higher-wage jobs. When COVID-19 struck, more people of color were serving as essential workers directly in the path of the virus.Decades of discrimination in housing corralled people of color into tightly packed neighborhoods, fueling the virus' spread. Those neighborhoods tend to lie in \"food deserts,\" leading to diabetes, obesity and heart disease that make people more likely to die from the virus.Environmental policies designed by white power brokers at the expense of the poor has poisoned the air they breathe, fueling cancers and leaving communities weakened in the path of the virus. A lack of federal funding left the most vulnerable communities cut off from healthcare at the most critical moment.Put simply, America's history of racism was itself a preexisting condition.Of the 10 U.S. counties with the highest death rates from COVID-19, seven have populations where people of color make up the majority, according to data compiled by USA TODAY. Of the top 50 counties with the highest death rates, 31 are populated mostly by people of color.\"COVID-19 has brought out into the open, with painful clarity, these divisions in our society that have been there for a long time but, for one reason or another, people were able to overlook them,\" said Philip Landrigan, director of the Global Public Health Program at Boston College.With nearly 1,000 people a day dying from the virus and scientists scrambling to grasp exactly how the virus spreads and kills, federal and state data has not provided enough demographic detail to show the full impact on communities of color. The race and ethnicity of people who contract the virus is known in 52% of cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But study after study has shown clear patterns in whom the virus kills.Black people are more than twice as likely to die from the virus than white people, and Hispanics and Native Americans are 1.5 times more likely to die, according to The COVID Tracking Project.\"You can't change the fact that America is so segregated and that people of color tend to live in communities where the environmental conditions are worse, and that can increase your risk of heart disease or lung disease and diabetes,\" said Richard Besser, former acting director of the CDC and president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nationâ€™s largest philanthropy dedicated solely to health care. \"You can't change that in the short run.\"A team of USA TODAY reporters pored over lawsuits challenging housing and health care policies, analyzed demographic data for communities hit hardest by COVID-19 and studied documents that reveal how government and business leaders worked together to marginalize populations. They interviewed the descendants of enslaved Americans who were denied homeownership in white neighborhoods and Indigenous Americans who had been funneled into reservations in exchange for federally funded health care that never came. They walked through Black communities on the fence line of polluting chemical plants, spent time with Latino farmworkers unable to afford the very food they harvested, and entered the homes of Asian immigrants afraid of being attacked by neighbors if they tested positive for the coronavirus.Housing policies speed spread of virusIn Essex County, New Jersey, decades of housing policies, laws and unspoken pacts excluded communities of color from spacious suburbs and forced them to cram into poor, often neglected neighborhoods in the urban core of Newark. Now, Essex has the 12th-highest death rate from COVID-19 in the country, according to data compiled by USA TODAY, fueled in large part by the high numbers of Black Americans living in segregated, low-income neighborhoods.That includes Ahou Yao, 40, a respiratory therapist at a local hospital who contracted COVID-19 in April and was forced to self-isolate in her bedroom in the two-bedroom apartment she shares with her husband and two young boys. She struggled from fever, shortness of breath and body aches and was unable to work for a month. Her husband had to go out for food, run errands and navigate their crowded neighborhood.\"Now I'm scared,\" she said, \"scared that he has it, too.\"Her husband has since developed a cough and chest pains, prompting a trip to the emergency room. He started self-isolating, passing the responsibility of venturing outside back to his wife.Environmental policies make people vulnerableIn Louisiana, along a stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, former slave plantations house massive chemical plants that spew chemicals deemed dangerous by the Environmental Protection Agency. When the plants were constructed, white homeowners had the means to move away, in time leaving a mostly Black population to breathe toxic air and suffer from such high rates of cancer that the entire region was dubbed \"Cancer Alley.\"One of those plants, in St. John the Baptist Parish, is the only one in the nation that produces neoprene. The synthetic rubber is used to make wetsuits and laptop cases, and the emissions from the production process are so harmful that the EPA lists the predominantly Black neighborhood next door to the plant as having the highest risk of cancer in the entire country. In September, St. John the Baptist Parish had the 27th highest death rate from COVID-19 in the nation\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LOUISIANA<|>GEO<|>Louisiana is a state in the United States where a pastor prays for his parishioners affected by COVID-19 and cancer.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW MEXICO<|>GEO<|>New Mexico is a state in the United States where an Indigenous community lacks adequate health care during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW JERSEY<|>GEO<|>New Jersey is a state in the United States where a sick hospital worker is concerned about infecting others in her neighborhood during the COVID-19 crisis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHILIP LANDRIGAN<|>PERSON<|>Philip Landrigan is the director of the Global Public Health Program at Boston College, who commented on the societal divisions exacerbated by COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHARD BESSER<|>PERSON<|>Richard Besser is the former acting director of the CDC and president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, discussing the impact of environmental conditions on health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER ALLEY<|>GEO<|>Cancer Alley is a region in Louisiana known for high rates of cancer due to pollution from chemical plants.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AHOU YAO<|>PERSON<|>Ahou Yao is a respiratory therapist in Essex County, New Jersey, who contracted COVID-19 and faced challenges in her living situation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a pandemic that has disproportionately affected people of color in the United States, leading to higher death rates among these communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USA TODAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>USA TODAY is a news organization that reported on the impact of COVID-19 on communities of color and analyzed demographic data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST.
