The fear was already there before she was pushed,\" Wong recalled of seeing the video in February on\nthe evening news. \"When he pushed her with such force [to] the ground, I automatically thought of my own mother. I automatically\nthought of my daughter.\"\nViolent assaults nationwide in the past two months have intensified fears among some Asian Americans on the Island. Some grew so\nconcerned over the safety of vulnerable elders that they are advising them to avoid public transportation and are limiting their own\ntrips outdoors, and have kept their children at home to learn remotely on top of worries of COVID-19 risks.\nDuring a prime-time speech Thursday night to mark the start of the one-year anniversary of the global coronavirus pandemic,\nPresident Joe Biden condemned \"vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans who've been attacked, harassed, blamed and\nscapegoated\" during the pandemic.\n\"It's wrong, it's un-American and it must stop,\" he said.\nSuffolk County police said they are investigating two reports of hate incidents with Asian victims but reported no cases of violent\nassaults targeting Asians. In one case, police said an Asian employee of a liquor store in Brentwood received \"a threatening phone\ncall based on his race/ethnicity\" last April. In another, anti-Asian graffiti was painted on the rear door of a Selden business in\nSeptember. Both are under investigation.\nNassau police said they received no reports of anti-Asian hate crimes in the past year but handled a bias incident last June in Jericho\nwhere one woman used an expletive before calling the other woman \"Chinese,\" to which the victim, who is Asian, responded that her ethnicity was not Chinese.\nViolent attacks increase\nNationwide, reports of violent attacks against Asians have surged this year.\nAn 84-year-old Thai man died after he was thrown to the pavement in San Francisco in January. A 91-year-old man was injured after\nbeing shoved in Oakland's Chinatown. In Manhattan, a man came up behind a 36-year-old Asian man walking on a street in\nChinatown and stabbed him in the torso, leaving the victim hospitalized in critical condition. The woman whose assault in Flushing so\nfrightened Wong was treated with stitches for a gash on her forehead. Earlier this week, a 75-year-old Asian man was robbed during\na stroll in Oakland that left him seriously injured. From 2019 to 2020, the NYPD reported a jump from three to 28 hate crime\nincidents involving Asians.\nKevin Sun, co-president of the Great Neck Chinese Association, said he has heard a handful of first-person accounts where drivers in\npassing cars hurled racial slurs at Asians walking on the street with their groceries.\nThe recent attacks prompted Vivian Luk, of Albertson, to tell her mother to avoid taking the Long Island Rail Road to travel to\nFlushing for a doctor's appointment last month. Her mother ended up taking a cab.\n\"It feels like it's stripping away our freedom. ... It angers me, obviously. It worries me even more,\" said Luk, 41, who emigrated from\nHong Kong to the United States when she was a child. \"I feel like we can't freely walk around. I feel like I'm going to be a target.\"\nLuk is not alone in worrying about staying safe on public transportation. Shaorui Li, chair of the Asian American Association of\nGreater Stony Brook, remembered reading about Asian women being attacked on subway trains and at train platforms.\n\"It triggers fear,\" said Li, of Setauket. \"Some of my friends commute to the city. Their family members became scared [of] what\ncould happen at subway stations.\"\nSome advocates and experts have tied the rise in anti-Asian crime during the pandemic to the economic downturn, geopolitical\ntensions and the rhetoric of politicians like former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly called COVID-19 a \"Chinese virus.\"\n\"We've seen racism during times of war, pandemic and economic downturn. Last year, we saw all three,\" said Russell Jeung, a\nprofessor at San Francisco State University and co-founder of STOP AAPI HATE, a national database that collects self-reported hate\nincidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\"We had the worst recession since the Great Depression. And we had the U.S.-China Cold War,\" Jeung said. \"Then again President\nTrump's rhetoric inflamed hatred and gave people the license to push and shove others.\"\nSince March, Jeung's group has documented more than 3,000 complaints, including 16 cases of verbal harassment, shunning and\nbeing barred from establishments on Long Island as of the end of February.\n\"There's widespread worry over safety,\" said Weiwei Zhang, of Mt. Sinai, a board member of the Suffolk County Asian American\nAdvisory Board, in Mandarin. \"As far as I'm aware of, there are no attacks on individuals here in Suffolk. But people are becoming\nmore careful about when and where they go.\"\nFarrah Mozawalla, executive director of Nassau County's Office of Asian American Affairs, said her office has received reports of about\na half- dozen anti-Asian harassment incidents since last March, including a Filipino woman being told to go back to her country in a\nCostco in Nassau County.\n\"With these anti-Asian sentiments ... people are apprehensive,\" Mozawalla said. \"They feel uncomfortable. They feel like they don't\nbelong.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KATHY WONG<|>PERSON<|>Kathy Wong is a New Hyde Park mother of three who expressed concern over the safety of Asians following recent attacks in New York City and on the West Coast.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>President Joe Biden condemned hate crimes against Asian Americans during a prime-time speech marking the one-year anniversary of the global coronavirus pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUFFOLK COUNTY POLICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Suffolk County police are investigating reports of hate incidents involving Asian victims.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NASSAU POLICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nassau police handled a bias incident involving an Asian woman but reported no hate crimes in the past year.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT NECK CHINESE ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Great Neck Chinese Association is an organization that represents the interests of the Chinese community in Great Neck.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIVIAN LUK<|>PERSON<|>Vivian Luk is a resident of Albertson who advised her mother to avoid public transportation due to safety concerns related to recent attacks on Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAORUI LI<|>PERSON<|>Shaorui Li is the chair of the Asian American Association of Greater Stony Brook who expressed concerns about safety on public transportation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>PERSON<|>Russell Jeung is a professor at San Francisco State University and co-founder of STOP AAPI HATE, a national database that collects reports of hate incidents against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>STOP AAPI HATE is a national database that collects self-reported hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and sentiments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONG ISLAND RAIL ROAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Long Island Rail Road is a commuter rail system that some residents are avoiding due to safety concerns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MT.
