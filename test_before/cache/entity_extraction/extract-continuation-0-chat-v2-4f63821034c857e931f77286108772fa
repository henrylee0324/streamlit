The couple, she said, \"wanted to come together and create a project that was rooted in solidarity.\"They made an Instagram slide show they hoped would serve as a piece of protest art and a resource for those who want to help.The first image, Ms. Yu said, was meant to look like a poster.\"Please! Protect our elders,\" it reads. \"Support our Chinatowns. Support our communities.\"The rest includes a timeline of incidents and a list of community organizations working in Asian communities in the Bay Area. They listed each organization's website and created a GoFundMe to donate to all the organizations at once; they would split up the money and one of their employers said they would match contributions. The initial goal was to raise $5,000. In two days, they raised $50,000.\"It was crazy,\" Ms. Yu said.The couple is working with the director of API Equality -- Northern California to distribute the funds fairly and transparently.Esther Kim, 22, said that when she first heard that some $10,000 worth of cash, tablets and computers had been stolen from her family's small Korean restaurant, the Crew, in San Francisco's Sunset district, it felt as if it could have been the last in a long line of devastating blows.On top of the financial loss to the restaurant, which her family treated like a second home, irreplaceable documents -- Ms. Kim's diploma, her mother's handwritten journals, immigration paperwork, receipts -- were also gone.Her mother, a cancer survivor, had continued to cook and serve takeout though she was at risk of getting sick from the virus. Ms. Kim said her parents were not native English speakers, so navigating the applications for pandemic relief and other government programs was challenging.The break-in came amid what she said had been a spate of similar burglaries or robberies in the neighborhood. \"In the Sunset, there's a lot of Chinese grandparents that run family restaurants that take cash only,\" she said.Ms. Kim said that her friends persuaded her to start a GoFundMe for the restaurant, and that her family had been amazed by and thankful for the outpouring of support.While she is troubled by the apparent rise in crimes against Asian-Americans, she said her family saw the burglary as an extension of wider suffering in the pandemic.\"We don't see the burglary as a form of Asian-American violence -- no one got hurt, everything was replaceable,\" Ms. Kim said. \"But we're in the crossfire.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EDA YU<|>PERSON<|>Eda Yu is a 25-year-old writer and journalist of Chinese and Indonesian descent who is involved in activism and community support initiatives in response to social issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYLES THOMPSON<|>PERSON<|>Myles Thompson is a Black designer and partner of Eda Yu, who collaborates on projects aimed at community solidarity and support.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>API EQUALITY - NORTHERN CALIFORNIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>API Equality - Northern California is an organization that works to support Asian and Pacific Islander communities and is involved in distributing funds for community initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CREW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Crew is a small Korean restaurant in San Francisco's Sunset district owned by Esther Kim's family, which faced a burglary resulting in significant losses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California where the events described, including the burglary of The Crew restaurant, took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNSET DISTRICT<|>GEO<|>The Sunset District is a neighborhood in San Francisco known for its community of family-run restaurants, including The Crew.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOFUNDME<|>EVENT<|>GoFundMe is a fundraising platform used by Eda Yu and Myles Thompson to raise money for community organizations and support initiatives.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDA YU<|>MYLES THOMPSON<|>Eda Yu and Myles Thompson are partners working together on community support projects and activism<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDA YU<|>API EQUALITY - NORTHERN CALIFORNIA<|>Eda Yu is collaborating with API Equality - Northern California to distribute funds raised for community support<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYLES THOMPSON<|>API EQUALITY - NORTHERN CALIFORNIA<|>Myles Thompson is involved in the project with Eda Yu that works with API Equality - Northern California<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREW<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>The Crew is a restaurant located in San Francisco, which experienced a burglary<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREW<|>SUNSET DISTRICT<|>The Crew is situated in the Sunset District of San Francisco<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDA YU<|>GOFUNDME<|>Eda Yu initiated a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for community organizations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYLES THOMPSON<|>GOFUNDME<|>Myles Thompson is involved in the GoFundMe campaign initiated by Eda Yu to support community organizations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREW<|>GOFUNDME<|>The GoFundMe campaign aims to support The Crew and similar community businesses affected by crime<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
