Armed with only whistles and pamphlets, the volunteer neighborhood patrol roams\nthe streets, checking out ATMs and mom-andpop shops in areas where Asian residents have experienced attacks\nthat have left this neighborhood on edge.\nSome volunteers drive more than an hour to walk these blocks — largely deserted by a combination of fear and\npandemic lockdown — to hand out bilingual fliers that explain how to report a crime to police. Similar patrols\nhave sprouted in Asian neighborhoods in Oakland, Calif., Los Angeles and New York City, a response to what\nthese communities say is a wave of racist violence and harassment since headlines about a virus from China\nbegan appearing in U.S. media a year ago.\nData is scant, but at least two U.S. cities logged an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans in 2020.\nThe New York Police Department reported at least 28 hate crimes that targeted Asian American victims last year,\ncompared with three the previous year. San Francisco’s preliminary data shows that nine hate crimes targeted\nAsian Americans in 2020, up from six the year before and four in 2018.\nSeveral viral videos of attacks on Asian pedestrians in February have heightened concerns: a Filipino man\nslashed with a box cutter on a New York City train; a 52-year-old woman shoved to the ground in Flushing,\nQueens; a woman punched in the face on a New York subway platform; and a Los Angeles man beaten with his\nown cane at a bus stop.\nIt’s unclear whether the violence in each of those viral videos was racially motivated, but the incidents have left\nAsian Americans feeling not only under attack but also largely alone in addressing neighborhood crime, with\nmany of the assailants remaining elusive. While some residents have joined neighborhood patrols, others are\narming themselves for protection. And still others have pushed for law enforcement to create task forces and\nliaisons to better address neighborhood concerns.\n“People are fed up about not being heard, not being seen and waiting for help,” said Will Lex Ham, an activist\nwho has participated in the San Francisco Chinatown street patrols and organized rallies in New York. “We’re not\ngetting the allyship we need, the resources we need. We have to pick ourselves up by the bootstraps.”\nPublic attention to attacks on Asian Americans soared after 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee was assaulted in\nSan Francisco in January. According to his son-in-law Eric Lawson, he was on his daily neighborhood walk and\nrecovering from multiple heart surgeries when he was shoved so violently that he later died.\n“Thai grandpa,” as he was known by community activists, became a rallying cry for celebrities and other Asian\nAmericans who added his face to their social media profile pictures. His daughter Amy Ratanapakdee believes it\nwas a hate crime.\n“It’s like a senseless act of violence and could happen to any one of us,” she said, adding that her own children\nhave been called racial epithets on the street during the past year. “I want everyone to know how my father\ndied and hope that in his memory, people will join me to hope that justice presides.”\nA 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty to murder in Ratanapakdee’s attack. And a suspect has been arrested\nin the case of Noel Quintana, the 61-year-old Filipino man whose face was slashed on a New York City subway\ntrain as he traveled to work earlier in February.\n“Nobody came, nobody helped, nobody made a video,” he said.\nQuintana reported the crime to police, and the suspect has been charged with assault. But many cases never\nget that far.\nVictims from marginalized communities can be reluctant to engage with police because of cultural differences,\nlanguage barriers or distrust. Even when they do report, proving that they were targeted because of their race is\ndifficult.\nTo fill in the data gap, some Asian American organizations are tracking these incidents on their own. Stop AAPI\nHate was launched last March to collect information on suspected cases of racially motivated violence and\nharassment. (AAPI stands for Asian American Pacific Islander.) It received more than 2,808 self-reported\nincidents from across the country by year’s end.\nOf those incidents, 9 percent were physical assaults and 71 percent were verbal attacks. Among the victims,\nmost were women, and about 126 reported being older than 60.\n“We were flooded immediately with hundreds of incidents,” said Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American\nstudies at San Francisco State University, who helped launch the site. “We have large numbers of elderly\nreporting that you wouldn’t think would complain, but they knew racism when they experienced it.”\nOf the self-reported victims, 41 percent were Chinese, 15 percent were Korean, 8 percent were Vietnamese and\n7 percent were Filipino. States with higher Asian populations report more incidents, with California most\nrepresented, followed by New York at about 13 percent.\nBut some Asian communities suspect that the rash of attacks is even worse than the data suggests. The\ntendency to underreport is why Iona Cheng thinks her community in Oakland has become a target.\n“They’re attacking Asian women, often for cultural reasons. They don’t speak out. They don’t press charges.\nThey don’t speak English well in some cases,” said Cheng, who is Chinese American.\nThe 48-year-old cancer epidemiologist had just delivered a Christmas gift in late December when a group of\npreteens tackled her to the ground, punched and robbed her. Police believe the same group stomped on an\nAsian woman in her 60s later that night, breaking her kneecap\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
