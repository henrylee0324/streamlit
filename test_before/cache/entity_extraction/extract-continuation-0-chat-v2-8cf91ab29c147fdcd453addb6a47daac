The cases include the murder in San Francisco of Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai\nman; a subway attack in New York City during which a 61-year-old Flipino man was slashed across the face with\na knife; and several assaults targeting older Asian Americans in the Chinatown section of Oakland, Calif.\n“This is not a problem that is new to our community,” Sam Hyun, chairman of the Massachusetts Asian American\nCommission, said Saturday. “Even last year when we saw the spike happening, what we heard was a lot of\nsilence from the media and those in the highest seats of power.”\nThe national coalition Stop AAPI Hate received 67 reports from Massachusetts of anti-Asian hate and\ndiscrimination between March 19 and Dec. 31, 2020, according to data released Tuesday.\nAlmost 90 percent of the cases from Massachusetts involved verbal harassment, about 7.5 percent were reports\nof people being coughed on or spat upon, and 3 percent were physical assaults, said Russell Jeung, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and professor at San Francisco State University.\nIn one local incident reported to the organization, an Asian-American shopper said a woman at a grocery store\nstated, “You will infect us.”\nIn another report from Massachusetts, a pedestrian said a driver screamed, “You're the reason I have to wear a\nmask.” An elementary school teacher in Massachusetts reported that a student taunted a Chinese classmate by\nclaiming he had COVID-19 and telling other children not to go near him.\nJeung said only a small portion of the incidents reported to Stop AAPI Hate would qualify for prosecution under\nmost laws against hate crimes.\n“To address most of the hate incidents, we need a different type of policy solution and that includes expanded\ncivil rights enforcement,” he said.\nA bill to reform the state's hate crime statute is pending in the Legislature and would expand the law to cover\nharassment. Attorney General Maura Healey is co-sponsoring the legislation.\nOn Tuesday, she encouraged people to report hate crimes against Asian Americans to her office.\n“Anti-Asian violence is on the rise,” she wrote. “The recent assaults on our elders are deeply disturbing.”\nThe state's Asian American Commission has developed a system for collecting reports about hate incidents and\nhas been using its online platforms to promote resources to combat the violence. Last spring, the commission\npublished a manual for responding to anti-Asian violence.\nWhile several prominent activists and organizers said they haven't received reports about local Asian\ncommunities being subjected to the same type of violence documented in California and New York, the incidents\nhave taken a psychological toll.\n“It just adds to their level of stress,” said Ben Hires, chief executive of the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood\nCenter.\nBoston City Councilor Ed Flynn, who represents Chinatown, said some of the neighborhood's elderly residents\nworry about leaving their homes to buy food or get fresh air because they fear being harassed in public.\n“We have to show more empathy to the Asian community for the very difficult year that they've had,” said\nFlynn. “They need to know that we're on their side and we're going to do everything we can to be helpful when\nthere is discrimination and bullying and intimidation or name calling.”\nOne way some advocates are trying to fight anti-Asian bias is by encouraging bystanders to speak up when they\nwitness wrongdoing. Distrust of law enforcement, language barriers, and immigration status sometimes prevent\nvictims from coming forward and that's why it's important for others to step up, they said.\n“A lot of the folks that are being targeted, they're not going to be able to defend themselves or they're not going to report it so we need to the community speak up for them,” Hires said.\nPresident Biden addressed the racism, harassment, and hate crimes directed in a video marking the Lunar New Year.\n“It's simply wrong,” he said. “It's a stain on our national character. Every person, no matter their race,\nbackground, religion, or language they speak, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.”\nLast month, Biden signed an executive order condemning anti-Asian racism and directed the Department of\nJustice to tackle the problem more aggressively.\nJessica “Jay” Wong, interim executive director of the Asian American Commission, said her community needs\nto hear more messages of support from local leaders.\n“We need our leaders to show that they are actively working to make our community feel safe and not feel\nalone,” she said. “None of this should ever be tolerated.”\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUNAR NEW YEAR<|>EVENT<|>Lunar New Year is a significant cultural celebration that marks the beginning of the new year in the lunar calendar, often associated with various festivities and traditions in Asian cultures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, leading to widespread health crises and social challenges, including increased anti-Asian bias.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAM HYUN<|>PERSON<|>Sam Hyun is the chairman of the Massachusetts Asian American Commission, advocating for the rights and safety of the Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a national coalition that tracks and responds to incidents of anti-Asian hate and discrimination in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>PERSON<|>Russell Jeung is a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and a professor at San Francisco State University, involved in research and advocacy against anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAURA HEALEY<|>PERSON<|>Maura Healey is the Attorney General of Massachusetts, co-sponsoring legislation to reform hate crime statutes and advocating for the Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON CHINATOWN NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center is an organization that supports the local Asian community, addressing issues such as discrimination and community safety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ED FLYNN<|>PERSON<|>Ed Flynn is a Boston City Councilor representing Chinatown, advocating for the safety and well-being of the neighborhood's residents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States, addressing issues of racism and hate crimes against Asian Americans and signing an executive order to combat anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian American Commission is a state body focused on addressing issues affecting the Asian American community in Massachusetts, including hate crimes and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUNAR NEW YEAR<|>COVID-19<|>The Lunar New Year celebrations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased anti-Asian bias during the festivities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAM HYUN<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Sam Hyun, as chairman of the Massachusetts Asian American Commission, is involved in addressing the issues reported by Stop AAPI Hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Russell Jeung is a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, directly involved in its operations and advocacy<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAURA HEALEY<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMISSION<|>Maura Healey supports the Asian American Commission's efforts to combat hate crimes through legislative reform<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ED FLYNN<|>BOSTON CHINATOWN NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER<|>Ed Flynn advocates for the Chinatown community, which the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center serves<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>MAURA HEALEY<|>Joe Biden's executive order against anti-Asian racism aligns with Maura Healey's efforts to reform hate crime laws<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAM HYUN<|>MAURA HEALEY<|>Sam Hyun's commission works alongside Maura Healey's office to address anti-Asian violence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>MAURA HEALEY<|>Russell Jeung's work with Stop AAPI Hate complements Maura Healey's advocacy for legislative changes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOSTON CHINATOWN NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMISSION<|>Both organizations work towards the safety and rights of the Asian American community in Massachusetts<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
