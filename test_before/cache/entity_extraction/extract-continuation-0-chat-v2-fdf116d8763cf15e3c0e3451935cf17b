Dana Williams. \"It was an intentional comment made toward Asian victims,\" Williams said.\nThe Police Department said the man is white but didn't identify the specific ethnicity of the shoppers. However, the department said it has learned members of the Stevens Point Hmong and Asian community have seen an increase in harassment since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Our community will not tolerate disparaging behavior and harassment,\" the Police Department said in a Facebook post. The department \"strongly encourages anyone who may have experienced this type of criminal behavior to contact law enforcement immediately.\"\nLaw enforcement officials in Wisconsin last month noted an uptick of racially motivated incidents related to the coronavirus, noting that harassers had apparently blamed Asian Americans because the pandemic has its origins in China.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison condemned chalk messages on a campus sidewalk blaming the virus on China and held a virtual town hall to warn against any racist or xenophobic acts toward Asian Americans living in Wisconsin.\nState Attorney General Josh Kaul has cited a Wisconsin statute that would penalize anyone convicted of a hate crime with a fine up to $10,000 or one year in jail.\nWausau Police Chief Ben Bliven told USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin earlier this spring that there had been one reported incident of what was believed to be a racially motivated incident. Bliven said police did not make an arrest in that instance.\nAt that same time, Marathon County Sheriff Scott Parks said there were ongoing investigations of people spitting or coughing on others and vandalizing homes and businesses of the county's Asian population.\n\"They are being victimized because misguided individuals have decided to attack them due to the COVID-19 pandemic that is impacting this nation,\" Parks wrote in a Facebook post.\nAn officer arrested the man on a suspected charge of disorderly conduct as a hate crime, Williams said. As of Tuesday morning, the man had not been officially charged.\nAnyone who is harassed or who sees other people being harassed in Stevens Point should call the Police Department at 715-346-1500. The department is taking the reports seriously and will investigate, Williams said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STEVENS POINT<|>GEO<|>Stevens Point is a city in Wisconsin where the incident of racial harassment occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANA WILLIAMS<|>PERSON<|>Dana Williams is a Lieutenant with the Stevens Point Police Department who commented on the racial harassment incident.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Wisconsin-Madison condemned racist acts and held a virtual town hall regarding the treatment of Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOSH KAUL<|>PERSON<|>Josh Kaul is the State Attorney General of Wisconsin who cited a statute related to hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEN BLIVEN<|>PERSON<|>Ben Bliven is the Police Chief of Wausau who commented on racially motivated incidents in the area.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTT PARKS<|>PERSON<|>Scott Parks is the Marathon County Sheriff who discussed ongoing investigations related to harassment of the Asian population.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to an increase in racially motivated incidents against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANA WILLIAMS<|>STEVENS POINT<|>Dana Williams is a police officer in Stevens Point, involved in addressing the racial harassment incident<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON<|>STEVENS POINT<|>The University of Wisconsin-Madison is located in Wisconsin and is concerned about the racial incidents occurring in Stevens Point<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOSH KAUL<|>STEVENS POINT<|>Josh Kaul, as the State Attorney General, is involved in addressing hate crimes occurring in Stevens Point<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEN BLIVEN<|>STEVENS POINT<|>Ben Bliven, as Police Chief of Wausau, is addressing similar issues of racial harassment in the region, including Stevens Point<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTT PARKS<|>STEVENS POINT<|>Scott Parks is involved in investigations related to harassment incidents affecting the Asian community in Stevens Point<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>STEVENS POINT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been cited as a factor contributing to the increase in racial harassment incidents in Stevens Point<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
