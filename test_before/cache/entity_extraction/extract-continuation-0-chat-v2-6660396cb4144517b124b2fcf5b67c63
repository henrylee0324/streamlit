An 89-year-old Chinese American woman was slapped and set on fire by two strangers in New\nYork. A 61-year-old Filipino American was slashed in the face by a stranger on the New York subway with a box\ncutter. These are just some of the recent attacks on Asians in the US.\nAlthough it might be difficult to determine the exact number of such hate crimes and instances of racial\ndiscrimination against Asians in the US, statistics from a number of local police forces, rights groups and\ninstitutes all point to the same conclusion: The surge in assaults and verbal abuse began with the start of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic in the country a year ago, when the previous US administration baselessly started using\nrhetoric blaming China for the spread of the novel coronavirus. It is unlikely to ebb without the state\nintervening.\nAlthough it was part of the Trump administration's scheme to pass the buck to others, it has created aftershocks\nthat US society is still experiencing now, as by openly inciting ethnic hatred, the previous administration\nawakened a dormant volcano in US society where discrimination against people of Asian descent has never\ndisappeared but only lurked at the bottom of some racists' hearts.\nNo wonder late last year, the United Nations issued a report warning of \"an alarming level\" of racially motivated\nviolence and other hate incidents against Asian Americans.\nIf the protests that swept the country after the brutal death of George Floyd on May 25 last year in Minneapolis\nexposed the long-term tensions between white and black Americans, the outcries of a number of rights groups\ncalling for an end to the verbal, physical and mental abuse suffered by Asian Americans reveals the unfair\ntreatment they have for a long time had to endure. Discrimination and antipathy toward those of Asian descent\nhave become more evident with the previous president fanning the flames of xenophobia.\nWhile more and more Asian Americans are setting up mutual assistance organizations and standing up to defend\ntheir rights, particularly when no signs have appeared showing the tensions are likely to ease in the foreseeable\nfuture, the US government, judicial authorities and law enforcement departments have no excuse to look on\nwith folded arms. Doing so, they will simply prove themselves to be birds of the same feather as the Trump\nadministration.\nUntil US society unites to battle the virus, the divisions and discrimination intentionally fostered by the Trump\nadministration will continue to take their toll on innocent lives.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States who signed an executive action banning certain rhetoric related to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUMP ADMINISTRATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Trump administration is the previous US government known for fostering xenophobia and using derogatory terms related to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is the country where hate crimes against Asians have surged, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that began in late 2019 and has been associated with a rise in hate crimes against Asians in the US.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in the United States where an 84-year-old Thai immigrant was attacked.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a city in the United States where multiple hate crimes against Asians have occurred, including the attack on an 89-year-old Chinese American woman and a 61-year-old Filipino American.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINNEAPOLIS<|>GEO<|>Minneapolis is a city in the United States where the brutal death of George Floyd occurred, leading to nationwide protests.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations is an international organization that issued a report warning of an alarming level of racially motivated violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are individuals of Asian descent living in the United States who have faced increased discrimination and hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIGHTS GROUPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rights groups are organizations advocating for the rights of marginalized communities, including Asian Americans, and calling for an end to discrimination and violence against them.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUTUAL ASSISTANCE ORGANIZATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mutual assistance organizations are groups formed by Asian Americans to support each other and defend their rights in response to rising discrimination.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>TRUMP ADMINISTRATION<|>Joe Biden's executive action is a response to the xenophobia fostered by the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUMP ADMINISTRATION<|>UNITED STATES<|>The Trump administration's policies and rhetoric have contributed to a rise in hate crimes against Asians in the United States.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>TRUMP ADMINISTRATION<|>The Trump administration's use of derogatory terms during the COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to increased hate crimes against Asians.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>An 84-year-old Thai immigrant, part of the Asian American community, was attacked in San Francisco.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Multiple hate crimes against Asian Americans occurred in New York, including attacks on an 89-year-old Chinese American woman and a 61-year-old Filipino American.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MINNEAPOLIS<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The protests following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis also highlighted the discrimination faced by Asian Americans.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The United Nations issued a report addressing the alarming level of violence against Asian Americans.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RIGHTS GROUPS<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Rights groups are advocating for the rights of Asian Americans and calling for an end to discrimination and violence against them.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUTUAL ASSISTANCE ORGANIZATIONS<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Mutual assistance organizations are being formed by Asian Americans to support each other in the face of rising discrimination.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
