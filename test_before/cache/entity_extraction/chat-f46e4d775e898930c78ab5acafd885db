She will allow her son to skip a nap or eat with the television on. \"Surely, we can't yell and scream every day, right?\"This \"laissez faire\" parenting style seems more than warranted during this strange, stuck-at-home period. But how can mothers fill up their tanks above empty? Is self-care even possible for mothers during the coronavirus era?May described her self-care during the pandemic as \"feast or famine.\" \"Some weeks, I'm on it,\" she said. \"I exercise, feed myself beautiful food, get some quiet time, and I feel really good. Other weeks I'm literally eating butter on bread in the corner of my kitchen eight times a day. It can feel like I just need to get my basic needs met and everyone is in the way of that.\"When I asked Persaud how she makes time for herself, she answered unequivocally, \"Showers!\" Whitney Sandoval, who lives in Wichita, Kan., with her 5- and 3-year-olds, will drive to pick up her groceries and then hang out in her car in the parking lot. \"I listen to music or a podcast, read or just sit in silence. It's the closest I can get to being alone.\"Eating properly, exercising, showering and getting a little alone time sound like they belong in the \"basic health requirements\" category as opposed to \"self-care for mothers.\"Even if those bare minimum self-care needs are met, mom rage doesn't just disappear. Rage has something to say and, according to Dr. Markham, \"Rage doesn't dissipate until it feels heard.\"Ruth King, an educator, life coach, meditation teacher and the author of many books, including \"Healing Rage: Women Making Inner Peace Possible\" and \"Mindful of Race: Transforming Racism from the Inside Out,\" said: \"Rage sits at the crossroads of personal transformation. Rage is not to be understood as a useless emotion, empty of knowledge. Rather, rage is fierce clarity and untapped fuel -- when we push rage away, we can't learn from it.\"Unfortunately, many mothers are doing just that. It is a challenge to find mothers who will talk on the record for this article. One mom eagerly emailed me about her rage, but then declined being quoted, saying, \"You know, mom shame.\"Bellenbaum of The Motherhood Center said, \"There's so much guilt that we feel toward ourselves, and a kind of inner-disappointment that we have these types of feelings at this intensity, especially toward our children.\"It can be challenging for partners living with those who have mom rage to be able to offer compassion and support, especially during the pandemic, when the emotional bandwidth of all parents is stretched thin.In support groups at The Motherhood Center, Bellenbaum has seen mothers find the nonjudgmental witnesses they need in each other. She said, \"When we connect with other women who are having the same feelings, that sense of community creates an initial and immediate relief.\"I have experienced this relief myself. What the mothers who write to me about their mom rage don't know is that their emails help me feel less alone, too. Since the pandemic began, people have been clapping, singing and howling into the night at a certain hour. Some clap to thank essential workers. Others howl in grief or just to relieve stress. Maybe it's time for mothers to take to the windows and bellow out a collective earsplitting roar.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
