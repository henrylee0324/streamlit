Oh, an attorney, was on her guard.\nThe two men drew closer.\n\"Infected and disgusting,\" one called out as they passed, she said.\nHeart racing, she ducked into a drugstore.\n\"I didn't think to say anything back when I heard it,\" she said. \"It really only sunk in as I was walking away.\"\nStepping back onto the street, Oh, 30, walked toward her car as an older couple approached. The woman made a show of detouring around her, she said.\n\"The woman literally walked off the sidewalk to be as far from me as possible,\" Oh said. \"There was no one else around and it was so obnoxious.\"\nOne incident, she might have written off as the kind of casual racism she has encountered all her life as the daughter of Korean immigrants. But two, in such a short time? It was clear, she said, that she was being targeted because she is Asian.\n\"You could feel the sense of hatred and scapegoating that was being built,\" Oh said. \"I avoided going out by myself for a while.\"\nAsian Americans across the United States are reporting a significant increase in hate crimes, harassment and discrimination tied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a year after these attacks began, the pandemic has galvanized Asian Americans, many of whom have long felt invisible, to speak out about the hatred and racism being directed their way.\nCommunity leaders are calling for greater enforcement of existing hate-crime laws, better connections with local police departments charged with investigating hateful incidents, and other Americans to consider the impact of their words and actions on the country's estimated 21 million Asian Americans. Asian American entertainers are using their platforms to highlight the issues, Asian American journalists are sharing their own stories of discrimination on social media and a growing chorus of federal lawmakers are demanding action.\nThe pandemic has especially \"struck a nerve\" for the Asian American community, which has forced many to realize that simple discrimination can turn violent, said Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who is a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. The fight against the \"bamboo ceiling\" is now also about physical safety, he said.\n\"For a large number of Asian Americans, especially the young generation, they're now seeing for the first time actual violence directed at them or their grandparents,\" Lieu said. \"It's highly disturbing.\"\nIn January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order condemning the attacks â€“ and without naming them, criticizing former President Donald Trump and other federal officials who repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the \"China virus\" or the \"Kung flu.\" The order calls for better data collection about hateful incidents, and mandates federal agencies to fight \"racism, xenophobia, and intolerance\" directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, or AAPI.\n\"The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin,\" Biden said in his order. \"Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.\"\nAmong recent incidents: In January, an 84-year-old Thai American man was brutally shoved in San Francisco and later died. That same month, police in Oakland, California, said a young man shoved three elderly people to the ground from behind in the city's Chinatown neighborhood, knocking out one. And this week, a 36-year old Asian man in New York's Chinatown neighborhood was stabbed and taken to a hospital in critical condition. The suspect in that assault faces charges that include attempted murder as a hate crime and assault as a hate crime, among other charges, the New York Police Department said.\nThe surge in hate incidents against the Asian American community since the start of the pandemic was set aflame last winter when Trump began scapegoating Chinese people for the explosion of coronavirus in the United States.\n\"It gave a lot of people permission (to act on) their prejudice,\" said Mabel Menard, president of OCA Chicago, a chapter of OCA, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for civil rights of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\"The outrage, the decrying of these recent incidents, is because of centuries of invisibility, of feeling like the history of anti-Asian racism is not known, that what happens to our community is minimized, is overlooked,\" said Choi, of Stop AAPI Hate.\nCompounding the challenge, the Asian American community is not monolithic. Instead, it's broad and encompasses people who trace their ancestry from China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea and other countries, all with their own distinct languages and cultures.\nShieh, of Asian Americans Advancing Justice of Chicago, said it's often hard to persuade victims of racial harassment or hate crimes to come to police because they speak a language other than English, or worry about their immigration status.\n\"We're not even a singular group that can unite,\" said Shieh, 28. \"We forget that our country is not necessarily a black-and-white paradigm or dichotomy.\"\nChen, of OCA, said Asian immigrants might worry about causing \"trouble.\"\n\"They're being targeted as Asians because they (perpetrators) don't think Asians are going to make as big as a fuss. It goes along with the stereotype that Asians are less likely to be vocal about things,\" Chen\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HELEN OH<|>PERSON<|>Helen Oh is an attorney who experienced racism during the COVID-19 pandemic while walking in downtown Denver.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to increased hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are individuals of Asian descent living in the United States, who have reported a surge in hate crimes during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TED LIEU<|>PERSON<|>Ted Lieu is a Democratic Representative from California and a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, advocating for the safety of Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States who issued an executive order condemning hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States whose rhetoric during the pandemic has been linked to increased racism against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OCA is a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization advocating for the civil rights of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that tracks incidents of hate and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCA CHICAGO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OCA Chicago is a chapter of OCA that focuses on civil rights advocacy for Asian Americans in Chicago.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HELEN OH<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Helen Oh experienced racism linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the impact of the event on Asian Americans.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Asian Americans have reported a significant increase in hate crimes and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TED LIEU<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Ted Lieu advocates for the safety and rights of Asian Americans in response to the hate crimes they face.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Joe Biden condemned the hate crimes against Asian Americans and issued an executive order to combat racism and xenophobia.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric during the pandemic has been linked to increased racism and hate crimes against Asian Americans.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCA<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>OCA advocates for the civil rights of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, addressing issues of discrimination.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Stop AAPI Hate tracks incidents of hate against Asian Americans, providing data on the discrimination they face.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCA CHICAGO<|>OCA<|>OCA Chicago is a chapter of OCA, working on civil rights issues for Asian Americans in the Chicago area.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
