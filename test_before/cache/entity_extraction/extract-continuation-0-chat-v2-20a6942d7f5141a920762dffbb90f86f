The mother-in-law was unsure what to do and feared her poor English would make getting information about where to get tested even harder.Huang felt confident she could help. Her English was solid and she had experience getting COVID-19 information as a project coordinator and health educator for the nonprofit NICOS Chinese Health Coalition.Instead, she wound up mired in a bureaucratic doom loop. After pursuing a series of online testing-site leads through a variety of city- and community-run websites – all requiring fluency in English – Huang soon learned that there were no available appointments at testing facilities close to their neighborhood.Huang eventually found a city-run testing site near Pier 30 along San Francisco Bay. The test was negative.\"That was frustrating for me, and I speak English,\" said Huang. \"I can't imagine what it would be like for someone like my mother-in-law. Well, I imagine you would simply give up on the hope of getting tested.\"Some residents refuse to get testedAsian Americans in San Francisco are often left behind by city partnerships aimed at helping vulnerable populations. Efforts to increase COVID-19 testing sites largely involve Latino groups, such as Unidos En Salud. The city's various isolation and quarantine sites for the homeless and partially housed also are being used largely by the city's Latino population, with Hispanics making up 45% of those in shelters while Asians account for 7%.Asian activists and health care workers trying to fill the void said they face a population that often is wary of Western medicine, fatalistic about getting the virus, culturally averse to passing along bad news to elders and nervous about losing employment.Natalie Ah Soon, health planner with the Asian Pacific Islander Health Parity Coalition advocacy group, said some people have told her, “If God means for me to be COVID-19 positive, then OK.”Kent Woo, executive director of the NICOS Chinese Health Coalition, said residents sometimes are suspicious of health care workers when they visit local low-income buildings to talk about coronavirus safety tips.\"Folks say, 'What's the point of being tested?' or 'We don't know where to go if we get infected,'\" he said. \"When we offer the option to anyone who tests positive to leave the premises and go to a hotel, they refuse.\"Teams have started to be more proactive, he said, heading to single-room occupancy residences and other housing complexes before there is any rumor of a positive test. The goal is to prepare residents so they know how to respond if someone falls sick.The need is dire. Amy Dai, project coordinator for the Chinatown Community Development Center, an advocacy group that also manages low-income properties, learned that in a building she manages, 10 residents out of 30 families had tested positive.When she approached two of the residents who had come down with a fever, they assured her they couldn’t be positive because they had not left the building. A subsequent visit to a doctor confirmed they had COVID-19.If they had not waited to get tested, “it could have prevented the other infections,” said Dai.The virus has many of San Francisco’s Asian Americans living like shut-ins.Only reluctantly did Sisong Thepkaysone, 70, recently make her way from her public housing building overlooking a freeway to her doctor’s office for a routine check-up.“I’m not sure what I what I would\ndo if I got the virus.”\nOnce at the doctor’s office, an interpreter was called by phone to translate medication directions.\nThepkaysone grew upset. She expected quality medical care after the risk she had put herself\nthrough, not a faceless voice.\n“It was not a personal experience, she said. “I didn’t like it.”\nThepkaysone prefers to spend her days at home making Laotian dishes for relatives. She used to\ngo out to shop and visit a local Buddhist temple to give alms. But now her children shop for her\nand the temple is closed. Sometimes she checks in on friends through Facebook. She watches\ntelevision, but her limited knowledge of English renders programs a pantomime.\n“I’m careful,” she said. “All I know is the virus is easy to get.”\nNo end in sight\nRong never found out whether her daughter had COVID-19. But her days remain filled with dread.\nFor the past few months, the family has had little money for food or rent, which is $750 a month.\nSometimes, neighbors give them something to eat; other times she goes to the local food bank.\n“We eat lots of potatoes,” she said.\nIt’s a far cry from the life she envisioned for herself. In Guangdong Province, Rong had a promising\njob as a clothing store clerk. At the urging of her former husband’s parents, she emigrated 12\nyears ago to California, where she found work as a janitor to keep the family afloat. Since the\npandemic hit, she has been on unemployment insurance.\nThat’s left the family with no option but to remain in their Chinatown apartment. The communal\nkitchen isn’t cleaned regularly. Sometimes, leaks from a floor above make their way to the shower\non the floor below. Often, the leaking fluid smells like urine.“Smell me, Mom, I’m more dirty than before I showered,” Amy Rong once told her mother.\nRong doesn’t know anyone who has contracted the virus. For her neighbors in the building,\ngetting tested remains a common fear.\nMostly, Rong waits for the day when the pandemic is over.
