It was fear, she says, of being punched, spat on or glared at because of her race or mask on the subway. It was fear of\nbringing covid-19 to the older generation in an immigrant family's cramped apartment.\nEach on its own was terrifying. But the combination, the 56-year-old says, \"is just impossible.\" Now a banner on Chau's website declares that her decadesold Malaysian-French restaurant is ready to \"REOPEN!\" - but staff who have to commute from outside the neighborhood won't come back yet to Aux Epices,\nChau says, and she wakes up sweating from nightmares about crowds.\nAsian-owned businesses are facing a crippling pileup of pressures during the coronavirus pandemic, advocates and researchers say - pressures that won't all\nease with the country's piecemeal reopening. They've been hurting longer, seeing their group's unemployment rate skyrocket faster, and struggling like many\nminority-owned shops to access government aid, often in industries with especially uncertain roads to recovery.\nLayered on top as they struggle to reopen: anxiety about attacks and discrimination, as Asian Americans get caught up in a political fight.\nFor some who think national leaders are encouraging people to link Asians and the coronavirus - blaming China for the pandemic has become a full-fledged\nRepublican political strategy - the stakes are higher than the fate of family businesses and already-threatened Chinatowns. They're about what kind of\ncountry the United States wants to be.\n\"Across the nation . . . there is this rise of this blame game,\" said Wellington Chen, who heads Chinatown Partnership, a nonprofit group supporting the\ndistrict in New York City. \"This is this legacy moment. . . . What did you guys do? Did you beat up on your neighbors? Is that what you're proud of?\"\nEconomic devastation\nIn mid-February in Houston, when analysts were still predicting \"very isolated\" damage to the restaurant industry, business owners in that city's Chinatown -\nfalsely rumored to have a coronavirus outbreak - were talking about hits to businesses worse than after Hurricane Harvey. Even Chinese American medical\npractices struggled in New York City, where one doctor attributed 10 to 15 percent drops in traffic to patients' fears of public transportation.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) went to San Francisco's Chinatown early this year to urge customers back.\nThe struggles of Asian American businesses have faded from the national spotlight as the pandemic takes hold all over the country, even as these businesses\nhappen to concentrate in industries facing extended shutdowns, thinner margins and risky futures in the era of social distancing.\nAs of last month, nearly 10 percent of Asian-owned companies in the United States were restaurants or other food businesses, a share far higher than any\nother group, according to an analysis by Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz.\nAsian business owners are important employers for their communities, experts said, meaning losses radiate outward.\nWhile the coronavirus has hit black and Latino communities especially hard, statistics in New York City also point to a dramatic fallout for Asians, who have\nseen the sharpest increase in unemployment nationwide since February.\nLess than half of Manhattan Chinatown's restaurants remained open for takeout after mid-March, when the city announced its sweeping shutdown, said\nChen, of Chinatown Partnership. Business advocates in several immigrant communities said it's tough to know yet how many are closed for good, when calls\ngo unreturned and it can feel rude to even raise the possibility of no return.\n\"I wish there was more attention from our elected officials,\" said Jennifer Tam, a Chinatown resident who launched a volunteer effort there.\n'Their words carry a lot of weight'\nWith anti-Asian racism flaring during the pandemic, many fear leaders' rhetoric against China could make the return to normal more perilous.\nBusiness after business has forgone even online orders and pickup both \"out of fear of the virus and out of fear of retaliation because of the virus,\" said\nVicente Reid, CEO of Arizona's Asian Chamber of Commerce.\nIn Georgia, where the push to reopen has been especially aggressive, the couple that owns Chong Qing Hot Pot in Chamblee, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, has\nthe same worries as everyone else. What if they get sick? What if a resurgence of the virus shuts them down?\nIt's the racism piled onto Asian owners' anxieties that makes Gina Rivers cry. She said she thinks President Trump is enabling it.\nTrump once made a point of referring to \"the Chinese virus,\" a phrase he has defended as describing the disease's origin, and a strategy memo instructed\nRepublicans seeking election to the Senate to \"attack China\" rather than speak to the president's handling of the coronavirus. Conservative candidates for\noffice across the country are taking up similar messages, with one divisive ad in Texas accusing China of having \"poisoned our people\" and leading some to\ndenounce \"race baiting.\"\n\"I worry for my husband's well-being in this climate,\" said Rivers, who is white. Her husband, Liang Rivers, is from China.\nLiang, who has cooked the same Szechuan menu for a decade, says he doesn't pay the president's word choices much mind. He's more worried, he said,\nabout the people who come in without masks and the fact they're doing half their normal business.\nHistorian Ellen Wu, who studies the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
