When gunfire broke out, Yaun's husband locked himself in a room and wasn't injured, said Yaun's half-sister Dana Toole.\n\n“He’s taking it hard,” Toole said. “He was there. He heard the gunshots and everything. You can’t escape that when you’re in a room and gunshots are flying – what do you do?”\n\n\"We could really use the help to cover her funeral expenses,\" loved ones said on a GoFundMe page. \"She has two beautiful babies she is leaving behind. We just don't know how to do any of this alone. If you can find it in your heart to donate, our Family will certainly appreciate all of your support.\"\n\nYaun's husband Mario González told Spanish-language website MundoHispanico that they were getting massages in two separate rooms when the gunfire erupted.\n\nHe said he hid in the room and when police came, he asked repeatedly if his wife was OK. He was detained and questioned with other witnesses and did not learn until later that his wife was one of the eight victims.\n\n\"What am I going to do?\" González said, adding that the shooting has left their 8-month-old infant without a mother. \"I have nothing.\"\n\nPaul Andre Michels\n\nPaul Michels, 54, owned an alarm company in Atlanta where he and his wife Bonnie lived for 26 years, his brother John said. Paul Michels had expressed interest in owning a spa and according to The Washington Post, worked as a handyman at Young's Asian Spa in recent months.\n\nJohn Michels said his brother was \"just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" They grew up with nine siblings in Detroit, riding dirt bikes and spending summer weekends at a lake and getting into mischief together, he said. They both served in the U.S. Army at the same time and his brother was an infantryman in the late 1980s.\n\n\"I'm the closest in age so we were basically like twins,\" said John, 52. \"We did everything together growing up.\"\n\nYong Ae Yue\n\nYong Ae Yue, 63, worked at the Aromatherapy Spa in Atlanta. She came to the USA from South Korea in the 1970s with her husband, Mac Peterson, The New York Times reported. Citing Peterson, the newspaper said they met while he was stationed in the Army and had a son before moving to Fort Benning, Georgia, and later had another one. The couple divorced in 1982 but stayed in touch.\n\n\"She was a good mother,'' Peterson told the Times. \"She was always there for her kids.''\n\nThe organizer of a GoFundMe page that has raised nearly $64,000 who goes by the name of Robert Peterson said he is Yue's youngest son.\n\n\"Mom was an amazing woman who loved to introduce our family and friends to her home-cooked Korean food and Korean karaoke,\" he wrote. \"Will miss joining mom on her weekly Sunday routine to the grocery store and traditional Korean dinner. She was always kind-hearted and willing to help everyone she encountered.''\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which cited Yue's two sons, said she was a licensed massage therapist who got laid off last year amid the pandemic and was happy to get back to work at the spa.\n\nSuncha Kim\n\nSuncha Kim, 69, was a grandmother who worked at the Gold Spa across the street from Aromatherapy and liked to line dance, the Times reported. Quoting a relative who asked not to be identified, the newspaper said Kim had been married for more than 50 years and had come to the USA from South Korea seeking better educational opportunities and a better life for herself and her family.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Kim came to the USA around 1980 and after working a number of odd jobs offered her cooking services as a volunteer to help raise funds for several organizations. Family members told the Post she made her children a priority.\n\nOn a GoFundMe page that has raised more than six times the original goal of $20,000, organizer Hillary Li thanked supporters on behalf of Kim's family: \"It brings tears to our eyes that you are all standing with us and our beloved halmoni (grandmother), mother, and wife. Suncha was such a strong loving presence in all of our lives and we miss her so much.\"\n\nSoon Chung Park\n\nSoon Chung Park, 74, who worked at Gold Spa, moved to Atlanta after spending the majority of her life in the New York metro area.\n\nHer son-in-law Scott Lee told the Post that after he married Park's daughter, they all lived under the same roof in Lyndhurst, New Jersey before Park moved to Georgia. She had planned to move back in with Lee and his wife in June, he said.\n\nLee said Park liked to work and stay active.\n\n“She was very healthy,” he said. “Everybody said she was going to live past 100 years old.”\n\nDaoyou Feng\n\nDaoyou Feng, 44. Not much is known about Feng who, according to a friend of Xiaojie Tan's who spoke with The Washington Post, started working at Young’s Asian Massage in the past few months and was kind and quiet.\n\nElcias Hernandez-Ortiz\n\nElcias Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, survived the shooting and is hospitalized in intensive care. He was intubated and is set to have surgery as early as next week to remove the bullet in his abdomen, his wife Flor Gonzalez told USA TODAY. She set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for medical costs where she wrote he was shot in the forehead, lungs, and stomach.\n\nGonzalez told USA TODAY that her husband was on the way to a business next door to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MARGARET RUSHING<|>PERSON<|>Margaret Rushing is the mother of a victim who was involved in a shooting incident at a spa and spoke to WAGA-TV about her daughter's experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YAUN<|>PERSON<|>Yaun is a victim of the shooting incident at the spa, whose husband locked himself in a room during the gunfire.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANA TOOLE<|>PERSON<|>Dana Toole is Yaun's half-sister who commented on the emotional impact of the shooting on Yaun's husband.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARIO GONZÁLEZ<|>PERSON<|>Mario González is Yaun's husband who was present during the shooting and later expressed his grief over the loss of his wife.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOFUNDME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GoFundMe is a crowdfunding platform used by loved ones to raise money for Yaun's funeral expenses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL ANDRE MICHELS<|>PERSON<|>Paul Andre Michels was a victim of the shooting, owned an alarm company, and had expressed interest in owning a spa.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BONNIE MICHELS<|>PERSON<|>Bonnie Michels is Paul Andre Michels' wife, who lived with him in Atlanta for 26 years.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN MICHELS<|>PERSON<|>John Michels is Paul Andre Michels' brother who shared memories of their childhood and military service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YONG AE YUE<|>PERSON<|>Yong Ae Yue was a victim of the shooting who worked at the Aromatherapy Spa and was known for her kindness and cooking.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAC PETERSON<|>PERSON<|>Mac Peterson is Yong Ae Yue's ex-husband who shared insights about her character and their family.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNCHA KIM<|>PERSON<|>Suncha Kim was a victim of the shooting who worked at the Gold Spa and was known for her dedication to family and community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOON CHUNG PARK<|>PERSON<|>Soon Chung Park was a victim of the shooting who worked at Gold Spa and had plans to move back in with her family.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAOYOU FENG<|>PERSON<|>Daoyou Feng was a victim of the shooting who had recently started working at Young’s Asian Massage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELCIAS HERNANDEZ-ORTIZ<|>PERSON<|>Elcias Hernandez-Ortiz survived the shooting and is currently hospitalized, facing serious injuries.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARGARET RUSHING<|>YAUN<|>Margaret Rushing is the mother of Yaun, a victim of the shooting incident<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANA TOOLE<|>YAUN<|>Dana Toole is Yaun's half-sister, providing emotional support during the aftermath of the shooting<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARIO GONZÁLEZ<|>YAUN<|>Mario González is Yaun's husband, who was present during the shooting and is grieving her loss<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOFUNDME<|>YAUN<|>GoFundMe is being used to raise funds for Yaun's funeral expenses<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL ANDRE MICHELS<|>BONNIE MICHELS<|>Paul Andre Michels is the husband of Bonnie Michels, and they lived together for many years<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN MICHELS<|>PAUL ANDRE MICHELS<|>John Michels is the brother of Paul Andre Michels, sharing a close familial bond<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YONG AE YUE<|>MAC PETERSON<|>Yong Ae Yue is the ex-wife of Mac Peterson, and they share children together<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUNCHA KIM<|>GOFUNDME<|>GoFundMe is being used to raise funds for Suncha Kim's family after her death in the shooting<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOON CHUNG PARK<|>GOFUNDME<|>GoFundMe is being used to support Soon Chung Park's family following her death<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAOYOU FENG<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN MASSAGE<|>Daoyou Feng worked at Young’s Asian Massage where the shooting occurred<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELCIAS HERNANDEZ-ORTIZ<|>GOFUNDME<|>GoFundMe is set up to help cover medical expenses for Elcias Hernandez-Ortiz after he survived the shooting<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
