He later died.Another video shows a 91-year-old man in Oakland’s Chinatown neighborhood being pushed facedown into the sidewalk cement from behind in an apparently unprovoked attack.The attacks quickly reinvigorated simmering outrage, fear and hurt over a wave of anti-Asian violence and harassment that community leaders say was spurred earlier in the pandemic by the rhetoric of former President Donald Trump, who insisted on calling the coronavirus “the China virus” or the “Kung Flu.”Carl Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, has tallied more than 20 assaults over the past two weeks in Oakland’s Chinatown alone. Many of them were not reported, Chan said, partly because it can take hours for police to arrive at the scene.“Our seniors are afraid to walk their own streets,” Chan said.Articles and Instagram slideshows using a now-familiar palette of pastels and bold lettering have since proliferated, sounding alarms about rising anti-Asian violence with jarring statistics and calls to confront racism against Asians with the urgency that has animated wide support for the Black Lives Matter movement.The violence comes as the Chinese community Friday marks the Lunar New Year, a muted celebration after a crushing year for the banquet halls, restaurants and businesses that would normally be pulsing with holiday cheer.The pandemic has hit San Francisco’s Chinatown, America’s oldest and largest, particularly hard. The lack of tourists; the spate of violent attacks and robberies; and pandemic-related racism against Asian Americans have combined to exacerbate the economic pain felt in Chinatown.A measure of the tense and subdued Chinese New Year celebrations this year was a scene from a park in San Francisco’s Chinatown on Thursday afternoon. Will Lex Ham, a New York-based actor, was helping lead a neighborhood safety patrol, handing out whistles to residents as well as a Chinese-language pamphlet titled, “How to Report a Hate Crime.”In recent weeks, the outrage over the attacks has grown broader.In early February, not long after leaders in Oakland’s Chinatown, along with Mayor Libby Schaaf, held a news conference pleading for help after a series of recent attacks targeting Asian American seniors, actor Daniel Dae Kim retweeted the video of the attack on the 91-year-old man, saying that such crimes “have been ignored and even excused.” He and actor Daniel Wu offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.California’s Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus issued a statement condemning “a surge in hate crimes targeting innocent Asian and Pacific Islander Americans,” describing it as “a national emergency.”But while researchers have said that inflammatory statements from leaders can exacerbate racist behavior, experts say it is difficult to quantify hate.Incidents of racism can take many forms — like being coughed on or spat upon, or being denied a ride-share. Tallying such incidents requires that victims tell authorities or another organization what happened, which can be difficult when they may feel ashamed or distrustful of those authorities.One statistic that has been widely cited, identifying a 1,900% increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans, appears to come from the New York City Police Department, which said that in 2019, only one anti-Asian incident was reported, compared with 20 in the first half of 2020, according to The Queens Chronicle.Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative formed in March aimed at tracking and responding to incidents of violence and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, received more than 2,800 reports of racism and discrimination targeting Asian Americans from March 19 to Dec. 31.Of those, the vast majority, about 71%, were incidents of verbal harassment. Physical assaults made up 8.7%.Russell Jeung, chair of the Asian American Studies Department at San Francisco State University and one of the leaders of Stop AAPI Hate, said that, according to the organization’s data, people 60 and older were disproportionately targeted with physical violence, as were women.Jeung said that it was not clear whether the recent attacks in the Bay Area were racially motivated but that it was likely that older people walking alone through their neighborhoods to shop may appear vulnerable. And particularly around holidays, they may be carrying cash.“We tend to see small upticks in crime during the Lunar New Year, because people are out shopping,” Jeung said.In another widely reported incident earlier this month, a 64-year-old woman of Vietnamese descent had just left a bank with more than $1,000 in cash for the holiday when her purse was snatched.What is clear, Jeung said, is that Asian American communities are in pain. And even with new recognition from President Joe Biden — who last month signed a memorandum directing federal agencies to explore ways of combating racism and xenophobia against Asian American and Pacific Islanders in the United States — there is more work to be done.“The community is alarmed and upset, and we demand justice,” Jeung said.San Francisco is not the only area of the country seeing a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans. New York City saw a large surge in hate crimes directed at Asians in 2020 and most of the increase was directly related to the pandemic, police said.There were at least 28 hate crimes against Asians reported to the New York police, and all but four involved an assumption that the victim had the coronavirus, police said. The crimes included assault, vandalism, theft and harassment.In August, the steep rise in bias crimes against Asian people prompted the New York City Police Department to form a special task force to investigate them.“It was a huge uptick, so much so\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old man who was violently attacked while out for a morning walk in San Francisco and later died from his injuries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where a 91-year-old man was attacked in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California where Vicha Ratanapakdee was attacked and where the Asian American community is facing a rise in violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in Oakland and San Francisco that has been significantly affected by anti-Asian violence and economic hardship during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARL CHAN<|>PERSON<|>Carl Chan is the president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, who has reported over 20 assaults in Oakland's Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States whose rhetoric during the pandemic is said to have spurred anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANIEL DAE KIM<|>PERSON<|>Daniel Dae Kim is an actor who has spoken out against the violence targeting Asian Americans and offered a reward for information on an attack.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANIEL WU<|>PERSON<|>Daniel Wu is an actor who, alongside Daniel Dae Kim, offered a reward for information leading to an arrest related to the attacks on Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an initiative formed to track and respond to incidents of violence and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the current President of the United States who signed a memorandum to combat racism and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was attacked in San Francisco, highlighting the rise in violence against Asian Americans in the city<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARL CHAN<|>CHINATOWN<|>Carl Chan has reported numerous assaults in Oakland's Chinatown, indicating the area's vulnerability to violence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric is linked to the rise in anti-Asian violence in San Francisco and other areas<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANIEL DAE KIM<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>Daniel Dae Kim has publicly condemned the violence that led to the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANIEL WU<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>Daniel Wu has also condemned the violence against Asian Americans, including the attack on Vicha Ratanapakdee<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Stop AAPI Hate tracks incidents of violence against Asian Americans, including those occurring in San Francisco<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Joe Biden's administration has recognized the work of Stop AAPI Hate in combating racism against Asian Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARL CHAN<|>OAKLAND<|>Carl Chan's reports of assaults are specifically related to incidents occurring in Oakland<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANIEL DAE KIM<|>DANIEL WU<|>Daniel Dae Kim and Daniel Wu collaborated in offering a reward for information on attacks against Asian Americans<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
