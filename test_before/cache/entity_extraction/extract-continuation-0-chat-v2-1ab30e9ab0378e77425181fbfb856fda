Judy Chu D-Calif., the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said the \"crimes are beyond terrifying but it just brings home to so many Asian Americans that they are fearful of their lives and circumstances\" as they faced both the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise in hate incidents. She said her group of lawmakers met with the Department of Justice to discuss a nationwide rise in hate incidents and \"we are right now determining actions against AAPI hate.\"\nShe called for the passage of legislation to improve hate crime reporting and also for the establishment of a national day to speak out against anti-Asian American hate on March 26.\nAnd Sen. Richard Blumenthal D-Conn. said the killings could spur legislation against hate crimes and for gun control. He is seeking Republican co-sponsors for legislation to create Justice Department grants aimed at improving reporting of hate crimes. \"This latest series of murders in Atlanta reflects a rising surge of hate crimes, particularly now directly against Asian Americans,\" Blumenthal said. \"Americans should be absolutely revolted and outraged but more importantly, do something.\"\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. said in a statement \"answers are urgently needed to determine whether this deadly attack was a hate crime and what can be done to prevent such an act from ever again happening.\" Pelosi added: \"Our entire nation must come together to speak out to Stop Asian Hate.\"\nVice President Kamala Harris, the first Asian American in the role, told reporters Wednesday that the killing \"speaks to a larger issue which is the issue of violence in our country and what we must do to never tolerate it.\"\nStop AAPI Hate, an advocacy group tracking hate incidents, said it had received nearly 3,800 reports of hate incidents across the country since March 2020, compared with roughly 100 incidents annually in previous years. Advocates have sounded the alarm on recent violent attacks against Asian Americans, including the killing of 84-year-old Thai American Vicha Ratanapakdee, and a recent increase in violence against older people across the country.\nCongress was set to debate the issue this week. A House panel will hold a hearing Thursday addressing the rise in anti-Asian American hate and discrimination, its first on the issue since 1987, with testimony from lawmakers and advocates including Chu. An anti-hate crime bill proposed by Chu and other lawmakers is likely to come up during the hearing as lawmakers consider their response to the rise in hate.\nThe shootings could breathe new life into efforts to pass legislation addressing the hate incidents. Asian American lawmakers introduced legislation addressing the issue in the last Congress, but other than the House's passage of a nonbinding resolution condemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic, no legislation was signed into law.\n\"We stand in full and complete solidarity with our Asian American brothers and sisters throughout the country and we will not rest until we stop Asian hate in America,\" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., a member of House Democratic leadership.\nDemocrats have blamed much of the increase in hate incidents on former President Donald Trump, citing his use of derisive terms for the coronavirus. Trump \"clearly stoked the flames of xenophobia against AAPIs with his rhetoric,\" Chu said, and ignored warnings from advocates and lawmakers. The result was the shooting, the latest in a string of racially motivated incidents against Asians nationwide, Chu said.\n\"It's clear the individuals were targeted because they are amongst the vulnerable in our country â€“ immigrant Asian women,\" Chu told reporters.\nLocal police said Wednesday that it was too soon to tell whether the killings at the massage parlors were racially motivated, saying they could have been linked to sex addiction.\nYale University Sociology Department chair Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies, said it was hard to disentangle race from the killings. The shooter had targeted Asian American women and, given how \"Asian American women have been viewed as exotic and feminine objects in U.S. mass media and suspected of prostitution from the earliest U.S. immigration restrictions,\" the suspect could easily have viewed Asian American women in the same manner, she said.\n\"If you talk to the average Asian American woman, most of us have been subject to varying degrees of sexual harassment that targets our gender and racial identities,\" Kao said. \"They do not exist separately in the lives of individuals.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in the United States where a shooting incident occurred, resulting in multiple fatalities and raising concerns about hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NICHOLAS WU<|>PERSON<|>Nicholas Wu is a journalist for USA Today who reported on the Atlanta shootings and the subsequent calls for action against hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUDY CHU<|>PERSON<|>Judy Chu is a U.S. Representative from California and chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, advocating for legislation against hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHARD BLUMENTHAL<|>PERSON<|>Richard Blumenthal is a U.S. Senator from Connecticut who is seeking to introduce legislation aimed at combating hate crimes and improving reporting mechanisms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NANCY PELOSI<|>PERSON<|>Nancy Pelosi is the House Speaker who emphasized the need for answers regarding the Atlanta shootings and the prevention of future hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>PERSON<|>Kamala Harris is the Vice President of the United States and the first Asian American in the role, addressing the broader issue of violence in the country.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an advocacy group that tracks hate incidents against Asian Americans and has reported a significant increase in such incidents since March 2020.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old Thai American who was killed, highlighting the violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the U.S. Congress, where lawmakers are debating legislation to address hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Yale University Sociology Department<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sociology Department at Yale University conducts research and provides expertise on issues related to race and gender, including the experiences of Asian American women.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUDY CHU<|>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<|>Judy Chu is a member of the House of Representatives advocating for legislation to combat hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICHARD BLUMENTHAL<|>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<|>Richard Blumenthal is a member of the Senate working alongside the House to introduce legislation against hate crimes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANCY PELOSI<|>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<|>Nancy Pelosi, as House Speaker, is leading discussions in the House regarding the response to the Atlanta shootings and hate crimes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>ATLANTA<|>Kamala Harris addressed the violence in Atlanta, linking it to broader issues of violence in the country<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ATLANTA<|>Stop AAPI Hate reported on the rise of hate incidents, including those related to the Atlanta shootings<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee's killing is one of the incidents tracked by Stop AAPI Hate, highlighting the violence against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUDY CHU<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>Judy Chu and Kamala Harris are both prominent figures advocating for the rights and safety of Asian Americans in the wake of the Atlanta shootings<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NICHOLAS WU<|>ATLANTA<|>Nicholas Wu reported on the Atlanta shootings, providing coverage of the events and their implications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Yale University Sociology Department<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>The Sociology Department at Yale University provides expertise on issues that Kamala Harris addressed regarding violence against Asian Americans<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
