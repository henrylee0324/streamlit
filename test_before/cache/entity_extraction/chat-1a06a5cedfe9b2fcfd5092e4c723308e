Across the bay, another man injured three people in Oakland's\nChinatown neighborhood. According to CNN, the victims were a 91-year-old man, a 60-year-old man, and a 55-\nyear-old woman.\nLast Tuesday in the Flushing neighborhood of New York City, a 52-year-old Chinese-American woman was\nattacked outside a bakery. A man shoved her to the ground so hard she struck her head and passed out. The\nsame day, two Asian seniors were assaulted on the subway in separate incidents, according to NBC.\nHouse Democrats last week denounced a spate of recent anti-Asian violence in California and New York. They\ncalled for Congress and the White House to pass legislation to provide Department of Justice grants to states\nand local governments to improve reporting of hate crimes.\nThey want to meet with the DOJ about enforcement and called for more support for victims. They said they\nwould hold hearings on the rise in racially motivated incidents.Three non-profits in San Francisco set up the Stop AAPI Hate campaign last year. They began tracking Anti-Asian hate incidents and found there have been nearly 3,000 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination across the\nUnited States since March 2020. Incidents were reported from 47 states and the District of Columbia. Fifty-six\npercent of incidents took place in either California or New York. Women experienced hate 2.3 times the rate of\nmen. Seven percent of respondents were seniors (60+).\n\"What we've seen over the past year is really an emergence of COVID-re-lated racism in the United States,\" said\nManjusha Kulkarni, executive director, Asian Pacific Policy & Planning Council.\nKulkarni said most of the racial incidents they reported were not nice but not all hate crimes. Verbal harassment\nand name-calling were most common, followed by shunning, physical assault, and spitting. Most incidents took\nplace in a business, then on a sidewalk or public street, followed by public parks. Chinese were most targeted,\nthen Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Japanese.\n\"Words matter. We cannot discount in which we had a full year in which we had a president and his colleagues\ncalling this virus the 'China virus', the 'Wuhan flu', and even worse derivations of that,\" said John C. Yang,\npresident of Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC).\nYang noted a poll last year which found 40% of Asian Americans either experienced discrimination or heard\nsomeone blame Asia or China for COVID-19. He said people are afraid of COVID-19 and afraid about loss of\nincome. Those are real fears but they've been conditioned to blame somebody else. Asians are easy targets.\n\"This fear that we have, this virus of racism is a virus that is very contagious and that affects all our\ncommunities... and we need to fight that virus together,\" Yang said.\nAdvocates think tougher law enforcement towards hate crimes will help but won't solve the problem. That would\nbe sort of like playing Whack-a-Mole and doesn't get at the underlying causes. One, of course, is white\nsupremacy, but another one is inter-ethnic hostility.\n\"Rather than accept the premise that we're against one another... I think we need to look back at the Civil\nRights Movement and had it not been for Black leaders after the victories of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the\nVoting rights Act, they said, 'you know what? No more to racial barriers in immigration',\" said Kulkarni.\nThey didn't have to say that. They didn't have to do that. But they did. And because of what they did many of\nus, including my own family, is in the United States. So we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to those Civil\nRights leaders because without them we wouldn't be there.\nSo let's think about that and think about how we work together toward solutions rather than accept the premise\nof white supremacy that is 'let's pit these groups against each other'\nWe have so much in common and we can work together for the right restorative and transformative justice\nsolutions. I think that's really what people are looking for- is this time healing rather than division,\" Kulkarni\nsaid.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
