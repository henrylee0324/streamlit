But most\nimportant to Vinuya is the economy, which has also been sinking into a pandemic-triggered recession despite a\nrobust stimulus package.\nThough it's tough for the registered Republican to swallow the racism against his own community, Vinuya said\nhe doesn't think Trump is trying to alienate Asian American voters when the president uses derogatory terms at\ncampaign events or continues to call COVID-19 the \"Chinese virus.\"\nThe Pew Research Center recently declared Asian Americans to be the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in\nthe U.S. electorate, but they are also arguably the least competitive voter block for Trump when considering\nwhere they live and how they relate to the Republican Party.\nIn Nevada, where Vinuya lives, Asians make up more than 10% of voters in a state both Democrats and\nRepublicans will fight for in the fall.\nWith his anti-Asian rhetoric, Trump is making the calculation that he has more to gain with his loyal base of older white voters thrilled by his inflammatory statements than to lose among the Asian American community,\nsaid Karthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy professor at the University of California, Riverside and founder of\nAAPI Data, which tracks Asian Americans.\nThat's because Asian Americans largely vote in very blue districts and otherwise non-competitive states,\nRamakrishnan said. A third of all such voters live in California alone.\n\"Part of the reason we don't see very much outreach is because Asian Americans tend to live in non-competitive\nstates in presidential elections,\" Ramakrishnan said.\nTrump's words have angered many Asian Americans and drawn condemnation from Trump's Democratic rival Joe\nBiden and former President Barack Obama. Republicans have also denounced the racist slur, notably Kellyanne\nConway, a White House counselor who is married to an Asian American, George Conway, whose mother was\nfrom the Philippines.\nWhite House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president's rhetoric, saying he's not being racist\nbut merely linking the virus to its place of origin. Trump in March also insisted that Asian Americans were\n\"amazing people\" and not at fault for spreading the virus.\nSince the virus took hold of the U.S. in March, advocates have also reported a rise in anti-Asian aggression and\nviolence from people blaming them for the pandemic. A group called Stop AAPI Hate said on July 1 that it has\ntracked 832 incidents of discrimination and harassment in California over the past 12 weeks.\nBiden at a June 27 town hall for Asian American voters slammed Trump's \"dangerous theories\" as xenophobic.\n\"Words matter and the president's words matter even more,\" Biden said.\nThe number of Asian Americans aligning themselves with the Democratic party has increased over the past 20\nyears while support for the GOP has trended down. A different Pew analysis in 2018 showed Democrats held a\n2-to-1 advantage among Asian American registered voters. The 27% who identified as or leaned Republican\nrepresented a 6% drop since 1998.\nFor Trump, AAPI Data found nearly all major Asian American ethnic groups held an unfavorable view of the\npresident. The only exception was the 62% of Vietnamese surveyed in 2018 who said they held a favorable\nimpression of him. On the other end of the spectrum, just 14% of Japanese voters felt the same way.\nIn the top 10 states with the largest Asian American voting populations, Trump in 2016 won only Texas and\nFlorida. But the ultimate swing state in this year's election, Ramakrishnan said, is unlikely to be determined by\nthe 3.6% of Florida voters who are Asian American given how large the state is.\nThat means in smaller states like Nevada, the deeper concentration of eligible Asian American voters -- the\nfourth-highest behind Hawaii, California and Washington state -- could potentially move the needle. About 11%\nof Nevada's voters are Asian.\nTrump lost the Silver State in 2016 to rival Democrat Hillary Clinton by just 2.4 percentage points, though\nNevada now leans more blue.\nFor Vinuya, who has been courted by the Trump campaign as the president of the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of\nCommerce, he knows he could be one of the few Asian American voters nationally who can make a difference\nfor the president's reelection prospects.\nVinuya said he's expressed his concerns about the anti-Asian slur to Trump's team, especially as he's trying to\nhelp his 600-plus members overcome the virus-related stigma and discrimination evident against Asian\nAmerican and Asian immigrant small business owners in Las Vegas.\n\"I gave them my two cents. That's pretty much it,\" Vinuya said. \"I don't want to waste my time on something\nI cannot control.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
