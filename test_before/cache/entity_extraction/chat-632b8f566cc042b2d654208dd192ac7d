Parades, street fairs and Spring Festival banquets have been cancelled, malls are empty and streets deserted.\nChinatown businesspeople say the biggest drop is not necessarily among Caucasian customers but Chinese- Americans alarmed by sensationalistic postings on WeChat and Weibo.\n\"Everyone's panicking,\" said Tony Hu, sitting in his empty Lao Sze Chuan restaurant during ­dinnertime in Chicago's Chinatown. \"It's crazy.\"\nParticularly hard hit are ­American companies dependent on ­Chinese tourists. Tourism ­Economics, a consultancy, ­expects Chinese visitors to fall nearly 30 per cent this year, and take some time to recover, costing the US economy US$10.3 billion through 2024.\nLisa Shan, a plasticware wholesaler serving some 100 ­Chinese restaurants in Flushing, New York, expects several of them to fold soon. \"This crisis is worse than Sars,\" she said, referring to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome.\nBeyond the economic headwinds, Chinese in North America are targets of mounting xenophobia and discrimination, including some being told to \"go home\".\nAlthough fear is a natural ­response to danger, especially given how much remains ­unknown about Covid-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus - the crisis has fanned entrenched stereotypes, say sociologists.\nA leaflet in the Carson area of Los Angeles with a fake World Health Organisation seal warned residents to avoid Asian- ­American businesses because of the coronavirus. A middle school student of Asian descent was ­reportedly assaulted and sent to hospital in southern California after classmates accused him of having the virus. Online postings suggest the illness should be ­renamed \"Kung Flu\".\nOther bullying, shunning and assault cases have been reported across the continent, sparked by unfounded fears that people with Asian features are more likely to carry the virus.\nBut Asian-Americans are not immune from sharing these fears.\nRay Tong, a contractor in ­Milpitas, California, avoids his favourite Chinese restaurants ­despite being Chinese- American. Recently, he headed to a Middle Eastern restaurant only to find that several other Chinese had the same plan. \"Well, so much for that idea,\" Tong said. \"The restaurant's name doesn't alter where the virus might eventually decide to visit.\"\nCivic boosters have tried to lift the spirits and pocketbooks of Chinatowns with rallies, raffles, workshops and public service ­announcements. \"Focus on facts, not fear,\" urged the Los Angeles county public health department, which warned against stigmatising Asians.\nCanada started a \"Together We Win\" campaign, while New York, with North America's largest Chinese-American community, started \"Show Some Love in ­Chinatown\" to urge customers to ­return.\nOthers are fighting the virus with online campaigns, such as #LoveBostonChinatown, #IamNotAVirus and\n#coronaracism.\nMayors, meanwhile, are leading with their chopsticks.\nMayors Libby Schaaf of Oakland, California, and Bill de Blasio of New York both dined on dim sum as the cameras whirred.\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi bought a wok in San Francisco's Chinatown. Chicago locals organised a reassuring \"food crawl\" through beleaguered Chinese ­restaurants. And Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney dived into a well-publicised plate of shrimp dumplings.\n\"Call it an act of moral, political and culinary support,\" The Philadelphia Inquirer said.\nCalifornia, with far more Asian-Americans than any other US state, has redoubled efforts to deter fear-stoked violence and discrimination.\nBut the toxic climate of ­national politics has not helped, said Manjusha Kulkarni, leader of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, which representing 1.5 million Los Angeles residents. The group recently hosted a rally against virus-related racism.\n\"We believe the Trump ­administration has fanned the flames of xenophobia, much of it directed at China because of trade,\" Kulkarni said. \"His uplifting of white supremacy messages is a cause of concern for communities of colour and immigrant communities around the ­country.\"\nBut Beijing has not helped with its early attempts to hide the disease and its decision to change the methods for counting ­infections, moves that have undercut trust and dented Asian-Americans' reputations.\nIn response, New York state assemblyman Ron Kim created an Asian-American health council to educate people, provide care and show that Asian-American doctors were part of the solution.\n\"We're trying to separate the virus from any one people or ­culture,\" said Kim, whose district includes Flushing. \"The virus has no walls.\"\nThe latest virus-related prejudice dovetails with a history of stigmatisation. In the wake of a surge of Chinese immigrants after 1850, US health officials - without evidence - often viewed Chinatowns as sources of leprosy, smallpox, bubonic plague and tuberculosis outbreaks.\n\"This hearkens back to the initiation of 'yellow peril' hysteria from the 18th century through the 19th century until now, the newest iteration,\" Kulkarni said.\nThe coronavirus epidemic is only the latest challenge to hit North American Chinatowns.\nHistorically discriminated against, their rights curtailed, forbidden to buy real estate elsewhere, Chinese retreated for protection to land shunned by the Caucasian mainstream, creating tight-knit communities.\nAs inner cities revived in recent decades, however, developers have often coveted the ground under Chinatowns, fuelling gentrification\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
