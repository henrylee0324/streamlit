Miller, Trevor Hughes, Romina Ruiz-Goiriena, Jorge L. Ortiz, Jordan Culver\n\nUSA Today\n\n2021-03-19\n\nATLANTA – Most were dedicated mothers. Some came to the USA looking for a better life. One was an Army veteran working as a handyman. Some loved to dance and sing karaoke.\n\nAuthorities have identified all eight people killed last week in a string of attacks at three Atlanta-area spas. Six of the women were of Asian descent including four who were Korean.\n\nSoon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, and Yong Ae Yue were identified Friday by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's office as the four victims of the shootings at two spas in Atlanta.\n\nThe medical examiner said Park, Grant, and Yue died of gunshot wounds to the head and Kim died of gunshot wounds to the chest.\n\nWednesday, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office released the names of the four victims at the spa there about 30 miles north of Atlanta. Those killed at Young’s Asian Massage were Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan, and Daoyou Feng. A 30-year-old Hispanic man was injured.\n\nFamily and friends reflected on the lives those who were killed lived. Most of the women had sons and daughters who remembered them as close friends. They dedicated their lives to making sure their children were taken care of.\n\nOther victims included a woman who had been married less than a year and a brother who left behind more than half a dozen siblings.\n\nThe shooting comes amid a spike in incidents of hate, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled by racist rhetoric by politicians such as former President Donald Trump, said Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks such incidents.\n\nWho gets to decide what is racism, hate? Atlanta shootings renew debate over white violence, privilege.\n\nHere's what we know about the victims:\n\nHyun Jung Grant\n\nHyun Jung Grant, 51, loved karaoke, dancing, and clubs, and she made the world's best kimchi stew, her son Randy Park told USA TODAY.\n\n\"She dedicated her whole life to raising us but even then she found time to enjoy herself with her friends,\" Park, 22, said. \"I can't articulate or express in any way to describe what she was or what she meant to us. I could say whatever word that comes to my head for her but it doesn't encompass a fraction of what she meant to us.\"\n\nPark said he learned only recently that his mom worked in a massage parlor – she initially said it was a makeup parlor in an effort to protect her two boys.\n\nThe two Atlanta spas attacked by the shooter had been repeatedly targeted in prostitution investigations in the past 10 years, according to police records. The documents show that 10 people had been arrested on prostitution charges but none since 2013.\n\nThe suspect told police his sex addiction drove him to commit the crimes and Atlanta authorities confirmed the man had \"frequented\" the spas.\n\nPark said he understands why his mother wasn't forthcoming and said he feels selfish and guilty for invading her privacy by asking about it. He said they never talked about her work, which sometimes kept her away from home for weeks at a time.\n\n\"What's so hard about letting people live how they want? If it does no harm to you, who is it harming then?\" he asked.\n\nBusiness owner, Army veteran, woman on a date: More on the victims of the deadly rampage through 3 spas in Georgia.\n\nXiaojie Tan\n\nXiaojie Tan, 49, who owned Young's Asian Spa and one other in Acworth, Georgia, also went by her American name Emily. She was remembered as a curious, hardworking, and caring woman who was always filled with joy.\n\n“She did everything for me and for the family. She provided everything. She worked every day, 12 hours a day, so that me and our family would have a better life,” Tan's daughter Jami Webb told USA TODAY.\n\n\"She was full of smiles and laughter. She was just a pleasure to be around,” said Michael Webb, Jami's father, who met Tan while traveling for work in China in the early 2000s.\n\nTan was the youngest of two girls born to parents who were Catholics in the communist country. Her dad fixed bicycles.\n\nMichael Webb and Tan met in her native city of Nanning, China, which sits on the border with Vietnam. Neither spoke the other’s language well, but that didn’t stop the pair from falling in love.\n\nSome called her by her Chinese name Xiaojie, or Jay for short. In China, it is customary to put the family name before the given name and Tan's name in Chinese transliterated to Tan Xiao Jie, which means pure or honest. Because Western countries use the surname last, her legal name in the USA was Xiaojie Tan.\n\nXiaojie Tan dreamed of traveling the world and celebrating her 50th birthday with her daughter. Then the Atlanta shooter ended her life.\n\nDelaina Ashley Yaun\n\nDelaina Ashley Yaun, 33, leaves behind a 13-year-old son and 8-month-old daughter. She and her husband had been married less than a year.\n\nHer mother Margaret Rushing told WAGA-TV that her daughter and son-in-law went to the spa on a date. When gunfire broke out, Yaun's husband locked himself in a room and wasn't injured, said Yaun's half-sister Dana Toole.\n\n“He’s taking it hard,” Toole said. “He was there. He heard the gunshots and everything. You can’t escape that when you’re in a room and gunshots are flying – what do you do?”\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in Georgia where the spa shootings occurred, resulting in the deaths of eight individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>PERSON<|>Hyun Jung Grant, 51, was a victim of the Atlanta spa shootings, known for her love of karaoke and dancing, and dedicated to raising her children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>PERSON<|>Xiaojie Tan, 49, was the owner of Young's Asian Spa and remembered as a hardworking and caring woman who provided for her family.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELAINA ASHLEY YAUN<|>PERSON<|>Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, was a victim of the Atlanta spa shootings, leaving behind two young children and a husband.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN SPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Young's Asian Spa is one of the locations targeted in the Atlanta spa shootings, owned by Xiaojie Tan.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHOOTINGS<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta spa shootings refer to a series of attacks that resulted in the deaths of eight individuals at three different spas in the Atlanta area.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARGARET RUSHING<|>PERSON<|>Margaret Rushing is the mother of Delaina Ashley Yaun, who spoke about her daughter's tragic death.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMI WEBB<|>PERSON<|>Jami Webb is the daughter of Xiaojie Tan, who shared memories of her mother and her hard work for the family.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>SHOOTINGS<|>Hyun Jung Grant was one of the victims killed in the Atlanta spa shootings<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>SHOOTINGS<|>Xiaojie Tan was one of the victims killed in the Atlanta spa shootings<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DELAINA ASHLEY YAUN<|>SHOOTINGS<|>Delaina Ashley Yaun was one of the victims killed in the Atlanta spa shootings<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN SPA<|>SHOOTINGS<|>Young's Asian Spa was one of the locations where the shootings occurred<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARGARET RUSHING<|>DELAINA ASHLEY YAUN<|>Margaret Rushing is the mother of Delaina Ashley Yaun, who was killed in the shootings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMI WEBB<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>Jami Webb is the daughter of Xiaojie Tan, who was killed in the shootings<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
