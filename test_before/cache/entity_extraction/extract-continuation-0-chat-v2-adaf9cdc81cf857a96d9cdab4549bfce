The analysis was compiled by the FBI’s Houston office and distributed to local law enforcement agencies across the country.\nThe virus, which was first discovered in China, has been referred to as the “Chinese virus” by President Trump rather than the coronavirus or the COVID-19 virus. Critics say Trump’s phrasing has fueled racism against people of Asian descent.\nTrump defended his use of the term “Chinese virus,” arguing it was because the Chinese government was trying to pin the blame on U.S. soldiers.\n“They said our soldiers started it. Our soldiers had nothing to do with it,” he told Fox News on Tuesday. “It came from China. I don’t regret it,” he said. “Everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn’t make any more of a big deal out of it. I think I made a big deal, I think people understand it.”\nIn recent days, Trump has shifted away from using the phrasing and condemned the harassment of Asian Americans, who have reported being blamed for the spread of the virus.\n\"It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world,\" he tweeted. \"They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form.”\nThe FBI report did not make any reference to Trump or any other U.S. official who has called it the “Chinese virus.” The analysis said there has been an increase in reports of hate crimes and listed several incidents across the country.\nIn a March 14 incident in Midland, Texas, \"three Asian American family members, including a 2-year-old and 6-year-old, were stabbed ... The suspect indicated that he stabbed the family because he thought the family was Chinese, and infecting people with the coronavirus,” the FBI report said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FBI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The FBI is the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a domestic intelligence and security service of the United States, which has reported an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans due to the coronavirus pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are individuals of Asian descent living in the United States who have been reported to be facing increased hate crimes during the coronavirus pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The coronavirus pandemic refers to the global outbreak of COVID-19, which has led to significant health and social impacts, including an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is the country where the coronavirus was first discovered and has been associated with the spread of COVID-19, leading to stigma against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIDLAND, TEXAS<|>GEO<|>Midland, Texas is a location in the United States where a hate crime incident against Asian Americans occurred during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRESIDENT TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>President Trump is the former President of the United States who referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” which critics argue has fueled racism against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FBI<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The FBI reported an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans due to the coronavirus pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The coronavirus pandemic has led to increased hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC<|>The coronavirus pandemic originated in China, which has led to stigma and hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRESIDENT TRUMP<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>President Trump's use of the term “Chinese virus” has been criticized for fueling racism against Asian Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIDLAND, TEXAS<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>A hate crime incident against Asian Americans occurred in Midland, Texas during the pandemic<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
