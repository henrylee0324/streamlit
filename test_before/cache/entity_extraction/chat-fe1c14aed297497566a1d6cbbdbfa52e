Chin's assailants received a fine and probation for his death.\nTensions between Asian and Black communities also date back decades and have been reignited by videos\nthat show Black perpetrators in many of the recent attacks on Asian Americans. Those tensions are rooted\nin the proximity in which the two under-resourced communities often live and work, while \"fighting for\ncrumbs,\" said John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice in\nWashington.\nThat mutual suspicion has boiled over several times in recent history. In 1991, a Korean American\nconvenience store owner in Los Angeles accused 15-year-old Latasha Harlins of shoplifting before fatally\nshooting her. The shopkeeper was convicted of voluntary manslaughter but served no jail time. A year\nlater, the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers who beat Rodney King set off riots in the city, during\nwhich many Korean shops were burned and looted.\n\"There was a sense that the shopkeepers were not respectful of the Black clientele, didn't trust the Black\nclientele, and also overcharged the Black clientele,\" said Brenda Stevenson, a history professor at UCLA\nand author of \"The Contested Murder of Latasha Harlins: Justice, Gender and the Origins of the L.A. Riots.\"\n\"On the other side, the Korean American shopkeepers at the time felt that the clientele were dangerous\nand untrustworthy. Some of them had been assaulted, some had been killed.\"\nAs the coronavirus pandemic has saddled low-income communities with economic hardships, community callouts and social media posts seeking volunteers to help protect business owners and older residents\nhave proliferated in Asian American neighborhoods. The volunteer patrols pass out whistles so residents\ncan alert others to active crimes, and offer to walk with older neighbors as they run errands.\n\"Our community is hurting,\" said Kevin Chan, owner of Golden Gate Fortune Cookie, which has been a\nstop for the San Francisco patrol. The Chinatown shop has been open for 58 years, but business has\ndeclined by 80 percent since the pandemic, Chan said.\n\"Everybody is worried about what's happening, not just me, everybody in the community,\" he said.\n\"Because they just want to make a living and then people are attacking them just because they have a\nstore or they're walking on the street.\"\nWhen it comes to anti-Asian sentiment, there are no boundaries to who could become a victim, said Tzi\nMa, known as Hollywood's go-to Asian father. The actor, in his 60s, said he was yelled at by a passerby\nin a car to \"be quarantined\" while in a Whole Foods parking lot in Pasadena, Calif., at the beginning of\nthe pandemic, before the shutdowns.\n\"No matter what happens to us, no matter what contributions we make,\" Ma said, \"all the prestige, all\nthe wealth that we've accumulated, we're still treated the same way.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
