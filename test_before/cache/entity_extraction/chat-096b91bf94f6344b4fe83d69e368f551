She has set up a food counter in the corner of her shop for homeless people to\ntake canned food, toothbrushes, toilet paper and other daily necessities.\n\"When homeless people come by, none of them take more than they need, even when I offer more,\" she recalled with light in her eyes.\n\"Perhaps I do feel a responsibility to serve my community.\"\nRestaurants hit hard Dinho Supermarket, standing since 1988 and now run by a couple from Beijing, is doing all right, with customers\nstocking up on groceries to shelter indoors. The gregarious beauty stylist from Malaysia who owns International Hair Design also oozes\noptimism -- she has won over enough customers in the past 30 years to sail through this crisis. Spencer Chang, a senior CPA originally\nfrom Taiwan, has also maintained a steady clientele.\n\"Chinese people live frugally, have good saving habits, and quickly adapt to new situations, which helps to cope with unexpected\ndisasters,\" Chang said in his office recently. \"We are also very cautious; we started wearing masks from the beginning. Of course, it's a\ndifficult time for everyone, especially restaurant owners. But overall, we are likely to weather the economic downturn from the pandemic.\nAmong hundreds of my clients, only one of them has gone bankrupt due to COVID-19.\"\nWhen I visited in late July, Chang's firm was busy as usual; 10 young employees wearing masks typed away at their desks.\nYet just a few steps away, things were different. At least two restaurants were closed. Food stalls, bakeries, tailor and gift shops have\ntaken the harshest blow of the pandemic. These business owners, many of them new immigrants, expressed financial woes and\nfrustration over what they saw as America's inadequate measures to curb the pandemic.\nJane Chung opened Family Baking just a little over a year ago. Inside the chic and minimalist shop, freshly baked buns, luscious\ndesserts, decorated cakes, and a variety of cold drinks sit neatly on the shelves and in the fridge. Milk tea and coffee can be ordered at\nthe counter. Chung was just about to launch a marketing campaign and expand her store when COVID-19 hit, cutting her ambitions\nshort. Since walk-in customers are very few now, Chung relies on takeout orders and struggles to pay her workers.\nChung looked anxious but radiated energy. She had been working for 16-hour days that week. \"It's been very difficult for us. Life was so\ngood before the pandemic! I really hope American people could work together to contain the pandemic. If America is ill, we Chinese\nAmericans won't be well.\"\nAs I stood to leave, Chung offered to give me a free milk tea. I insisted on paying. The Hong Kong-style milk tea with boba and ice\ntasted delicious.\nIn the atrium of the building, a traditional Chinese garden breathes under a placid square of sky. On a normal weekend, children jump\nup and down on the small red bridge to marvel at the red carp swimming in the pond beneath, adults play Chinese chess on the stone\ntables, and seniors stroll along the low wall painted with the Great Wall. But it is mostly empty now. The carp swim without an\naudience. A row of stone tables provides outdoor seating for cautious diners.\nInside the food court (mask required), six food vendors (one closed) continue to serve a rich selection of fusion dishes, including\nroasted duck, pork chop with Peking sauce, fried chicken, sweet and sour bass, hot and sour soup, mapo tofu, and hand-pulled\nnoodles. It smells like Asian street food with a tinge of American and Mexican flair.\nGuijie Zhang is the owner of the Sichuan food vendor I frequent. Her husband, the chef, works behind the curtain in the kitchen.\n\"We were closed for two months, but the landlord ordered us to open in late May, so that we can keep paying the rent,\" said Zhang.\nShe had laid off the previous workers and hesitated to hire new ones for fear of further exposure and financial burden. The PPP loan\nshe'd received only helped for two months. She and her husband now toil without a salary.\nZhang told me that her restaurant orders had gone down 70%, but the prices of ingredients had spiked. Before COVID-19, she\nnormally had about 140 orders on a Saturday; now, less than 50. Before, a crate of string beans was around $20; now, over $40.\n\"But we can't raise the price on our menu. We mainly serve lower-income customers; it's a difficult time for everyone,\" Zhang said,\nlowering her eyes.\nIn the dining area shared by all the vendors, about five or six customers dined sparsely at lunchtime on a recent Thursday. Two large\nmetal fans kept the air in the space well circulated.\nOriginally from Hebei, Zhang came to Atlanta four years ago to join her husband. \"In the beginning, I struggled a lot. But over time,\nI've grown to like this country more and more. People here are very nice and simple, with good hearts, unlike the hyper-competitive\nculture in mainland China.\"\nZhang sees America mainly through the lens of her customers -- nearby employees and residents, including many who are African\nAmerican, Hispanic, Southeast Asian, and Chinese students.\n\"Who knows when this pandemic will end,\" Zhang said. \"Luckily, people are much more cautious now. My customers are very good at\nwearing masks and social distancing. We'll just have to wait and see when God guides us back to a normal life.\"\n\"Are you a Christian?\" I asked, surprised at this discovery. Religion is discouraged in mainland China.\n\"Yes, I\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
