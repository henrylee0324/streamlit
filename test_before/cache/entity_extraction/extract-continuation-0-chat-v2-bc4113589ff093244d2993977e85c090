Canadian actor Russell Yuen, 54, was relaxing by picturesque Lake Nipissing during a break from filming, his sunglasses perched on his nose as he absorbed the icy beauty in front of him.\nA white couple walked up and stood nearby. Presently the man spoke. This is Yuen's account of what happened next. The man said, \"It's so much nicer here than Toronto. We can get away from that Chinese virus.\"\nYeun turned to him said, \"Excuse me?\"\nThe man said, \"Oh you know, the virus that Chinese people brought over.\"\nSo Yuen took off his glasses and said, \"Please repeat that again.\"\nAt that, the man turned verbally abusive. \"You f---ing Chinese man, why aren't you wearing a f---ing mask? Get the f--- away from me. You and your f---ing virus, go back to where you came from.\"\nYuen is fourth-generation Canadian. His ancestors literally united Canada - they came here to build the Canadian Pacific Railway, upon which rested British Columbia's decision to join Confederation in the late 1800s.\nHe said, \"You mean, Montreal?\"\n\"Don't be a f---ing smartass,\" the man said. \"You know what I'm f---ing talking about.\"\n\"Meanwhile his wife is hiding behind him,\" Yuen said. \"Like I'm the alien creature from \"Alien\" that could spit acid at her and dissolve her or something.\"\n\"I said 'Look, you're entitled to your opinion but you're wrong.'\" And as Yuen walked back to his room, the man kept swearing, saying \"We're going to get out of this place. I can't believe they're letting those types of people in here.\"\nThis wasn't Yuen's only recent experience with racism since the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. And bigots being bigots everywhere, he is one of the rising number of people of East Asian descent being singled out around the world and blamed for the deadly virus.\nA few things need unpacking in light of this renewed racism. First, people of East Asian descent need systemic support. Second, it establishes why COVID-19 should never be called the Chinese virus. Third, the brazen bigotry has blown the facade off the \"model minority\" myth.\nThe Indian actor Meiyang Chang was out for a jog on the streets of Mumbai recently when two guys sped past him on a bike, \"screaming 'corona' and laughing,\" he told media. He gets teased by friends, which he told media he didn't mind, but he also gets randomly called \"corona\" on Instagram, which he does.\nAmerican writer/journalist Jeff Yang shared his \"first 'breathing while Asian' moment\" on Twitter. An older white woman with a mask turned on him at a grocery store and shouted \"F--- you.\"\n\"As I stared at her, she pulled off her mask, coughed directly at me, turned on her heel and walked off.\" Other Asian Americans responded with their own experiences on Yang's Twitter feed.\nSinophobia being rampant in the U.S. isn't surprising. That country's president read a speech last week on which, as a Washington Post photographer captured, the word \"corona\" was scratched out and replaced with \"Chinese.\" All the better to cover his own ineffectual response that led to the U.S. swiftly becoming the world's third-most affected country.\nIt's not racist, Donald Trump insisted. It's just where the virus originated.\nCalling it Chinese serves no purpose other than to stigmatize a group of people. Viruses have been named after geographical areas even if they didn't originate there. The Spanish flu, for instance. After the outbreak of MERS - or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - in 2012, the WHO recommended not naming viruses after regions to mitigate negative impacts on places and peoples. Instead, it encourages descriptive terms - respiratory, pulmonary - whom it impacts by age - geriatric, senile - whether acute or chronic etc.\nNew York recently established a new hotline to report hate crimes against Asian Americans. Canadian police jurisdictions should consider either doing the same or expanding their existing lines and work on targeted outreach so more people know whom to call. Toronto police's Hate Crimes Unit had not seen an increase in reports, but \"hate-related crime often goes unreported to police,\" said police spokesperson Meaghan Gray, who encouraged people to report it by calling 416-808-2222.\nIt's virtually impossible to prove hate crimes unless people walk around with cameras turned on. However, hotlines can document incidents and connect people to legal resources. The rest of us don't need to be silent bystanders either. (Obviously, if dangerous, call 911.)\nOn Saturday, Yuen was going about his business heading to a grocery store in Montreal when a white staffer blocked the automatic doors from opening and yelled through the glass: \"Go put on a f---ing mask and gloves.\"\nExplicit spoken racism is verbal assault. It can leave people feeling shell-shocked and scarred. But the daily subtler forms take a different toll. For Yuen, that comes in the looks he gets in public, the extra-wide berth people give him, but not his white wife while walking, the overly watchful eyes as he picks up things in a store.\nThese experiences have left Yuen flooded with \"that feeling of racism I used to get when I was much younger.\" That was a time of growing up in Montreal when he was the only Asian person, \"the only Asian in elementary school, one of two Asians in high school, the only Asian in theatre school.\"\nBoth East Asians and South Asians are touted as model minorities in western nations. Look how well they do in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NORTH BAY<|>GEO<|>North Bay is a city in Canada where the events described took place, known for its picturesque Lake Nipissing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSELL YUEN<|>PERSON<|>Russell Yuen is a Canadian actor who has experienced racism during the COVID-19 pandemic and is a fourth-generation Canadian.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAKE NIPISSING<|>GEO<|>Lake Nipissing is a large lake in Ontario, Canada, known for its scenic beauty and recreational activities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONTREAL<|>GEO<|>Montreal is a major city in Canada where Russell Yuen grew up and experienced racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to increased racism and discrimination against people of East Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEIYANG CHANG<|>PERSON<|>Meiyang Chang is an Indian actor who has faced racism during the COVID-19 pandemic while jogging in Mumbai.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEFF YANG<|>PERSON<|>Jeff Yang is an American writer/journalist who shared his experiences of racism during the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former president of the United States who referred to COVID-19 in a racially charged manner.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a state in the U.S. that established a hotline to report hate crimes against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TORONTO<|>GEO<|>Toronto is a major city in Canada where police are encouraged to expand outreach for reporting hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEAGHAN GRAY<|>PERSON<|>Meaghan Gray is a police spokesperson in Toronto who commented on the reporting of hate-related crimes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSELL YUEN<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Russell Yuen experienced racism linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the impact of the pandemic on individuals of East Asian descent.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEIYANG CHANG<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Meiyang Chang faced racism while jogging, which is a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on societal attitudes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEFF YANG<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Jeff Yang shared his experience of racism during the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrating the broader issue of discrimination faced by Asian Americans.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Donald Trump's comments about COVID-19 contributed to the stigmatization of Asian communities during the pandemic.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH BAY<|>RUSSELL YUEN<|>Russell Yuen was in North Bay during the events described, where he experienced racism.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONTREAL<|>RUSSELL YUEN<|>Russell Yuen grew up in Montreal, which shaped his experiences with racism as an Asian individual.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>New York established a hotline to report hate crimes against Asian Americans, a response to the rise in racism during the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TORONTO<|>NEW YORK<|>Both Toronto and New York are cities that have taken steps to address hate crimes against Asian communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEAGHAN GRAY<|>TORONTO<|>Meaghan Gray is a spokesperson for the Toronto police, discussing the reporting of hate crimes in the city.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
