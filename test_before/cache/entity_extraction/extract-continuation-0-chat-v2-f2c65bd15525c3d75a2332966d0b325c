No, not one of the myriad sexist gags circulating about women ‘letting themselves go’ in isolation or men risking infection to get away from their nagging wives. This joke goes that women must love lockdown because at least creepy men aren’t able to harass them any more, thanks to social distancing rules.\nUnfortunately, in reality, the opposite seems to be true.\nSince writing an article last month about the gendered impact of the pandemic, I’ve been deluged with messages from women describing their recent experiences ahead of International Anti-Street Harassment Week, which runs until April 25.\nOne woman was walking down the street with her four-year old daughter when men started shouting \"slut\" at her. Another hasn't even been able to walk her dog without being shouted at. Many have described running a distressing gauntlet of sexual comments while exercising. Women have been catcalled in their own front gardens, pursued by men in cars and vans, and followed home.\nAnd a significant number of women, from multiple countries, are reporting that the situation has worsened dramatically during lockdown.\n“Is anyone else experiencing more street harassment than usual at this time?” asked one. “Leering and sexual harassment seems to be rife. I have never been ogled, stared at or catcalled so frequently,” wrote another. Several simply agreed: “it seems worse now.”\nA woman from Washington, who didn’t want to be named, was walking in her neighbourhood when a man started staring hard at her and then began to follow her. When she crossed the street, so did he. Shops and businesses were shuttered - there was nowhere to go. Finally, she was able to retreat into a corner shop. He followed her. When she asked him to leave her alone, he slammed the iron gate of the shop in anger. After he finally disappeared, she burst into tears.\n“I’m used to street harassment,” told me, but during the pandemic, there is “extra fear of someone getting close to you, more fear when there aren’t witnesses, more fear when you can’t rush into an open store for help because most of them are closed.”\nHolly Kearl, founder of US non-profit Stop Street Harassment, has been collecting stories of abuse in public spaces. From Argentina to France, she says women have been reporting a spike in street harassment during lockdown. She adds: “Racism and xenophobia is making street harassment worse for those of Asian descent in many parts of the world, including the US, [where] there has been a huge rise in racial harassment against Asian-Americans.”\nEmily May, Co-Founder and Executive Director of global grassroots movement Hollaback!, agrees, giving the example of a woman who was walking down the street when a man shouted at her to “keep your Asian disease away”.\nIn Australia, Melbourne-based campaign It’s Not a Compliment has also seen “a real shift” towards “racially-motivated incidents being targeted at women by complete strangers”. Co-founders Aakanksha Manjunath and Annelise Lecordier told me: “These are issues that have always existed in our society and only require events like this pandemic to bubble up to the surface.”\nThey say widespread feelings of anger and helplessness have created “an opportunity for some to express these opinions in what they feel is now a more accepting climate... We’ve heard stories of international students being verbally abused while wearing face masks at tram stops, racial slurs being thrown at Asian-Australians while out in public ... Now, this has started to escalate to assault with people reporting being spat on or punched for wearing a face mask. These stories are unfortunately becoming more common and are sadly going mostly unreported.”\nWith the virus still spreading, some have questioned the importance of an event like International Anti-Street Harassment week during the current crisis.\nBut May has a robust response: “We know that this moment will change us. What we don’t know yet is how. Do we want to return to a world where girls and women receive nasty, sexualised comments about their bodies? No. We didn’t want that world to begin with. Now we have a break in the action to rethink what we want and build towards what's possible.”\nKearl adds: “Now is the time to plan for a future that has safer public spaces for all-to learn how to be a bystander; to talk about consent and respect and the right way to interact in public spaces.”\nAnd if anyone has a blueprint for what that safer future might look like, it is the Washington woman who was pursued for several blocks. Because after she finally entered the corner shop, she and the owner exchanged “a look between women that we all know too well”, before the owner asked where she lived, locked up her shop and walked her home.\nHollaback! And Asian Americans Advancing Justice are offering free online bystander intervention training to combat xenophobic harassment.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EVERYDAY SEXISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Everyday Sexism is an organization focused on raising awareness about gender-based harassment and discrimination, particularly in public spaces.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURA BATES<|>PERSON<|>Laura Bates is a prominent advocate against street harassment and the founder of the Everyday Sexism project, which collects and shares women's experiences of sexism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ANTI-STREET HARASSMENT WEEK<|>EVENT<|>International Anti-Street Harassment Week is an annual event aimed at raising awareness and combating street harassment globally, running until April 25.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP STREET HARASSMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop Street Harassment is a US non-profit organization founded by Holly Kearl that collects stories of street harassment and advocates for safer public spaces.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLLABACK!<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hollaback! is a global grassroots movement that empowers individuals to combat harassment in public spaces through storytelling and community engagement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUS<|>GEO<|>Australia is a country where incidents of street harassment, particularly racially-motivated harassment, have been reported to increase during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MELBOURNE<|>GEO<|>Melbourne is a city in Australia where the campaign \"It’s Not a Compliment\" operates, addressing issues of street harassment and racial incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AAKANKSHA MANJUNATH<|>PERSON<|>Aakanksha Manjunath is a co-founder of the Melbourne-based campaign \"It’s Not a Compliment,\" which addresses street harassment and racial incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNELISE LECORDIER<|>PERSON<|>Annelise Lecordier is a co-founder of the Melbourne-based campaign \"It’s Not a Compliment,\" focusing on street harassment and racial issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASHINGTON<|>GEO<|>Washington is a location where a woman experienced street harassment and where the community is engaged in discussions about safety and harassment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURA BATES<|>EVERYDAY SEXISM<|>Laura Bates is the founder of Everyday Sexism, which focuses on combating street harassment and raising awareness about gender issues<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ANTI-STREET HARASSMENT WEEK<|>EVERYDAY SEXISM<|>Everyday Sexism reports on the events and experiences related to International Anti-Street Harassment Week<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLLABACK!<|>INTERNATIONAL ANTI-STREET HARASSMENT WEEK<|>Hollaback! participates in International Anti-Street Harassment Week to promote awareness and combat harassment<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP STREET HARASSMENT<|>INTERNATIONAL ANTI-STREET HARASSMENT WEEK<|>Stop Street Harassment is involved in the activities surrounding International Anti-Street Harassment Week<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AAKANKSHA MANJUNATH<|>IT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT<|>Aakanksha Manjunath is a co-founder of the campaign \"It’s Not a Compliment,\" which addresses street harassment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANNELISE LECORDIER<|>IT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT<|>Annelise Lecordier is a co-founder of the campaign \"It’s Not a Compliment,\" focusing on street harassment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLLABACK!<|>STOP STREET HARASSMENT<|>Both organizations work towards combating street harassment and empowering individuals<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON<|>LAURA BATES<|>The experiences shared by women in Washington highlight the issues Laura Bates addresses through Everyday Sexism<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MELBOURNE<|>AAKANKSHA MANJUNATH<|>Melbourne is the city where Aakanksha Manjunath's campaign \"It’s Not a Compliment\" operates<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MELBOURNE<|>ANNELISE LECORDIER<|>Melbourne is the city where Annelise Lecordier's campaign \"It’s Not a Compliment\" operates<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
