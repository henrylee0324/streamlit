To understand accountability is not a punishment but a way forward.\nWhen Su moved to Arlington from Texas in 2013, she noticed how teachers were confusing her daughter, a\npreschooler then, with the other Asian student in her class. It was her own history repeating itself.\n“I was very much ashamed of being Taiwanese American because that is what I was taught by all of the\nimplicit messages growing up. Do I want my daughter to feel that same sense of self-loathing, fear, and\nshame? Or do I want her to feel proud of all that she is?”\nSu had to put in self-work to gain confidence and examine how her insecurity around her identity stemmed\nfrom how Asian Americans are deemed outsiders. The recent rise in violence against Asian Americans, has\nbeen a reminder of the source of that fear.\n“It's brought to light how Asian Americans can be so easily demonized as the perpetual foreigners,” said Su,\n37, founder of Diverse We Run, celebrating athletic inclusion.\n“We can be so quickly blamed as having been the cause of this pandemic and therefore any anger can be\ndirected toward Asians and justified. For so many Asians, it's representative of our experience, like the pain\nand hurt that we feel doesn't matter,” she added.\nSu doesn't know where to start, but she knows acknowledgement is necessary.\n“There's no fixing it if we don't agree on there even being a problem to be fixed,” she said. “I don't know. It\nalways feels like the people of color who are affected by white supremacy are tasked with solving it.”\nMayoral candidate Michelle Wu believes we have to start with partnership, community, and policy.\n“It's not enough to say we are having a conversation about Asian American issues and check the boxes. It's\nnot enough to do that with any identity,” the city councilor said. “Just as important are policy changes. We\nneed to make sure there are processes and everyone needs to have a voice in shaping the future.”\nLike Miller and Tom, Wu's first experiences with racism date back to being teased over her seaweed snacks\nand having her language mocked as a young girl in Illinois. She would see the bias again, even more\npainfully, in how her mother was treated by the mental health care system.\n“What I have known my whole life and what I have found in shared connection with far too many Asian\nAmerican friends is a feeling of invisibility,” Wu said.\nIt wasn't until she was a student at Harvard, volunteering in Chinatown at the Asian American Civic\nAssociation, that she felt truly connected to the pieces of her identity she had to code-switch growing up. We\ncan't let that happen to the next generation.\n“There's over 110 different languages spoken in BPS,” Wu said. “The breadth and beauty here, the diversity of\nrace, ethnicity, background, lived experiences — for me it is most important to create the spaces and\ncommunity for people to bring their full multidimensional selves into the conversation.”\nIn February 2020, as Chinatown was being crushed by xenophobia, Wu co-hosted a dim sum brunch at China\nPearl to combat the stigma. Since then, she has been in conversation with people all over the country\nabout not just anti-Asian discrimination, but racism. The violence against Asian Americans is a reminder of\nhate crimes across communities of color.\n“The model minority myth has pitted us against other communities in a generational fight for equity and\njustice. Our communities have been closely intertwined. Many of the Asian American immigrants benefitted\nfrom the Civil Rights activists and leaders who fought for justice and kept the door open for everyone else,”\nWu said.\n“The partnerships for communities of color standing side by side through the decades — we need to be\nbuilding that infrastructure for communities to connect and stand shoulder to shoulder to end racism\nagainst all communities who have been otherized in our system, period.”\nWe cannot continue to treat the fight against supremacy as a segregated fight. The cost of division has\nbeen our freedoms. Collective liberation requires a collective revolution.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SU<|>PERSON<|>Su is a Taiwanese American who has worked on her identity and founded Diverse We Run to promote athletic inclusion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIVERSE WE RUN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Diverse We Run is an organization founded by Su that celebrates athletic inclusion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICHELLE WU<|>PERSON<|>Michelle Wu is a mayoral candidate and city councilor who advocates for community partnership and policy changes regarding Asian American issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN CIVIC ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian American Civic Association is an organization where Michelle Wu volunteered, connecting her to her identity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BPS refers to Boston Public Schools, which has a diverse student body with over 110 different languages spoken.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood that has faced xenophobia and where Michelle Wu co-hosted a dim sum brunch to combat stigma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA PEARL<|>EVENT<|>China Pearl is the venue where Michelle Wu co-hosted a dim sum brunch in February 2020 to address anti-Asian discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARVARD<|>GEO<|>Harvard is the university where Michelle Wu was a student and began to connect with her identity.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SU<|>DIVERSE WE RUN<|>Su founded Diverse We Run to promote athletic inclusion and address issues faced by Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHELLE WU<|>ASIAN AMERICAN CIVIC ASSOCIATION<|>Michelle Wu volunteered at the Asian American Civic Association, which helped her connect with her identity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHELLE WU<|>BPS<|>Michelle Wu emphasizes the diversity within Boston Public Schools and the importance of representation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHELLE WU<|>CHINATOWN<|>Michelle Wu co-hosted an event in Chinatown to combat stigma against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHELLE WU<|>CHINA PEARL<|>The dim sum brunch at China Pearl was organized by Michelle Wu to address anti-Asian discrimination<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SU<|>MICHELLE WU<|>Both Su and Michelle Wu discuss the challenges faced by Asian Americans and advocate for change<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SU<|>HARVARD<|>Su's experiences reflect the challenges of identity that many face, similar to Michelle Wu's experiences at Harvard<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
