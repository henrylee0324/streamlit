He grabbed a sack of breakfast and a sack of lunch.\n-- Richard Fausset\nBoston\nThalia Bardell crouched in front of the laptop she had propped up on a chair, centering it in the roughly three-foot-wide wedge of space between the end of her unmade bed and\na dresser.\n\"Hi, B!\" she called out to the screen. \"How's the dogs?\"\n\"They're trouble,\" the screen replied.\nMs. Bardell teaches barre exercises, which are modeled loosely after ballet, to mostly women in their 20s, 30s and 40s. When Boston shut down, her clients begged her to come\nup with a way to give their minds and bodies a break from idle worry about the pandemic.\nLive-streamed exercise instruction was having a moment before the crisis, as home fitness companies like Peloton paired their machines with remote-access instructors. Now\nteaching remotely is one of the few options instructors have left.\nShe called the group to attention. \"All right guys, let's go!\" Nurses, bartenders, teachers and financial analysts appeared on the screen, following her through a routine of squats\nand lunges as she snapped her fingers with the precision of a metronome.\n\"Kerry, that's a beautiful pace!\" she said.\n\"Maite, lower your hips an inch.\"\nMs. Bardell believes in moving quickly so no one has time to dwell on the pain. \"You're in a physically uncomfortable situation right now in your body, and you're in an\nemotionally uncomfortable situation in the world,\" she said. \"And it's like, we're going to get through this together, just like we do with every single class.\"\n-- Caitlin Dickerson\nAmherst, Mass.\nAriana Lee, a Chinese student stranded on the campus of Amherst College, walked into a dining hall past a pandemic-era warning sign: \"Admittance Restricted.\"\nThe food service workers lit up when they saw her. She greeted them brightly. \"Hi! Can I get the pulled chicken taco over Mexican rice? And some guac with the salsa, please?\"\nThese days, with classes now online, campus feels like a ghost town. In her one-minute walk to the dining hall, Ms. Lee, a senior, encountered only one other person, a janitor\npushing a cart full of cleaning supplies across the common room, like a lone ship leaning into a storm.\nThe servers wore gloves, but no masks. The open cereal dispensers stood empty. The cafeteria tables were cordoned off.\nThe food was tastier than it was before the pandemic, she said, but the portions were smaller. She preferred not to pick up food in town, though, because \"people on the street\nsay racist things.\" The other day, a man called her Chinese-American friend a racial expletive and said that wearing a mask would not help.\nHer parents have left Beijing and are riding out a two-week quarantine in a small apartment in Hong Kong. They have to wear trackers on their wrists. Food is delivered to their\ndoor. Her mother sprays down every package with disinfectant.\nMs. Lee walked back to her dorm room, unpacked her brown paper bag and laid out her food on her desk: two bananas, an orange, a cardboard bowl of rice, a cardboard box of\nchicken tacos. She looked at it, as if it were a still-life painting, and did not eat.\n-- Anemona Hartocollis\nPittsburgh\nThe milk incident happened right after lunch, when the 8-year-old was losing patience with long division. It was his second tantrum of the day, the first set off by a missing\nsweatshirt. That one had been pretty loud, but at least it didn't involve spilling milk all over the dining room table.\nA home-schooling mother as of two weeks ago, Tanying Dong, 39, has been trying to make sure her oldest son does at least some schoolwork every day. When he is absorbed\nin a lesson and his little brothers, ages 2 and 5, are nestled in the soft glow of PBS Kids, Ms. Dong can then maybe get to some of the endless other tasks. Such as her payingjob, in public law. And the housework. The meals. The checking-in on friends and relatives.\nThree boys, at prime havoc age, with no school, no day care, no babysitter, no playgrounds, no friends and, for much of the time, no other adult.\nAmid it all, she has taken up sewing. Specifically, face masks for the whole family. Ms. Dong's husband is a pediatric anesthesiologist, and while the children's hospital is not yet\na battlefield infirmary like so many urban emergency rooms, things could change quickly.\nThe sewing had been going pretty well until the 5-year-old knocked the sewing machine on the floor. Her husband seems to have fixed it. She'll know tonight when she picks it\nback up, once the kids are in bed.\n-- Campbell Robertson\nNorman, Okla.\nPolice Officer Chris Allison pulled over a red Chrysler 300 sedan, approached from the passenger side and asked the driver for his license and insurance. The man pulled the\npapers from his glove compartment and leaned toward the window. But Officer Allison didn't touch them.\nHe reached instead for his cellphone.\n\"OK, I'm just going to take a picture of that,\" Officer Allison told the man.\nOfficer Allison, 34, patrols southwest Norman, where a stay-at-home order is in effect and four nursing home residents have died from the pandemic. Norman is different now,\nand so is policing.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SIX FLAGS OVER GEORGIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Six Flags Over Georgia is an amusement park where individuals can enjoy various rides and entertainment options.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHARD FAUSSET<|>PERSON<|>Richard Fausset is a person who mentioned his previous employment at Six Flags Over Georgia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON<|>GEO<|>Boston is a city in Massachusetts known for its rich history and cultural significance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THALIA BARDELL<|>PERSON<|>Thalia Bardell is an instructor who teaches barre exercises, primarily to women in their 20s to 40s.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PELOTON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Peloton is a fitness company that offers exercise equipment and live-streamed workout classes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMHERST COLLEGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amherst College is a private liberal arts college located in Amherst, Massachusetts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARIANA LEE<|>PERSON<|>Ariana Lee is a Chinese student who is currently stranded on the campus of Amherst College during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONG KONG<|>GEO<|>Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China known for its vibrant city life and strict quarantine measures during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TANYING DONG<|>PERSON<|>Tanying Dong is a mother who has taken up home-schooling her children during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORMAN<|>GEO<|>Norman is a city in Oklahoma where police officer Chris Allison is patrolling during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRIS ALLISON<|>PERSON<|>Chris Allison is a police officer in Norman, Oklahoma, adapting to new policing methods during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICHARD FAUSSET<|>SIX FLAGS OVER GEORGIA<|>Richard Fausset previously worked at Six Flags Over Georgia, indicating a direct connection to the organization.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THALIA BARDELL<|>BOSTON<|>Thalia Bardell teaches barre exercises in Boston, linking her profession to the city.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THALIA BARDELL<|>PELOTON<|>Thalia Bardell's teaching methods are influenced by the live-streamed exercise trend popularized by Peloton.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARIANA LEE<|>AMHERST COLLEGE<|>Ariana Lee is a student at Amherst College, directly connecting her to the institution.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARIANA LEE<|>HONG KONG<|>Ariana Lee's parents are currently in Hong Kong, which connects her to the location through her family.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TANYING DONG<|>NORMAN<|>Tanying Dong is a resident of Norman, Oklahoma, where she is home-schooling her children.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRIS ALLISON<|>NORMAN<|>Chris Allison is a police officer patrolling in Norman, establishing his role in the city.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
