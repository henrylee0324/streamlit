The President has even used the term \"kung flu\" - widely considered\nderogatory - twice, although the White House has said the term merely underlines the origin of the coronavirus.\nPew Research surveyed 9,654 American adults from June 4 to 10 for the study on personal experiences with racial and ethnic discrimination since the beginning of the\ncoronavirus outbreak, and opinions about whether racist views towards different groups have become more common.\nEveryone who took part is a member of Pew Research's American Trends Panel, an online survey panel recruited through a national, random sampling of residential addresses.\nThe survey is weighted to be representative of the US' adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories.\nHowever, as the survey included a total sample size of 278 Asian Americans, and English-speaking Asian Americans only, it may not be representative of the overall Asian\nAmerican population, Pew Research said.\nAsian Americans, who account for 6 per cent of the US population, are the fastest growing major racial or ethnic group in the country. Hispanics make up 18 per cent of the\npopulation overall, while Black Americans are 12 per cent,\nThe survey also found that a majority of Asian adults (58 per cent - more than black or Hispanic adults) say it is now more common for people to express racist or racially\ninsensitive views about people who are Asian than it was before the coronavirus outbreak.\n31%\nProportion of Asian Americans who say they have been subject to slurs or jokes because of their race or ethnicity since the outbreak began - compared with 21 per cent of black\nadults, 15 per cent of Hispanic adults and 8 per cent of white adults.\nIt also found 42 per cent of black Americans and 36 per cent of Asian Americans saying they worry a great deal or a fair amount that other people might be suspicious of them\nbecause of their race or ethnicity if they wear a mask or face covering when in stores or other businesses.\nIn contrast, 23 per cent of Hispanics and just 5 per cent of white adults say they worry about this.\nBlack Americans had mixed experiences though, with many experiencing more support in the wake of the May 25 death of African American George Floyd while he was\nrestrained by a police officer, which ignited nationwide outrage across ethnic groups.\n© 2020 Singapore Press Holdings\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PEW RESEARCH CENTRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pew Research Centre is a nonpartisan American think tank that provides information on social issues, public opinion, and demographic trends shaping the United States and the world.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the 45th President of the United States, known for his controversial remarks regarding race and ethnicity, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country in East Asia, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged, leading to significant political and social repercussions in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country in North America, where the survey on racial and ethnic discrimination was conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>PERSON<|>George Floyd was an African American man whose death while being restrained by a police officer sparked nationwide protests and discussions about racial injustice.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 OUTBREAK<|>EVENT<|>The Covid-19 outbreak refers to the global pandemic caused by the coronavirus, which has led to significant social and racial tensions, particularly in the United States.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEW RESEARCH CENTRE<|>COVID-19 OUTBREAK<|>Pew Research Centre conducted a survey on racial and ethnic discrimination during the Covid-19 outbreak<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>CHINA<|>Donald Trump has blamed China for the Covid-19 outbreak, which has affected US-China relations and domestic politics<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>UNITED STATES<|>Donald Trump, as President, has influenced public opinion and policy in the United States regarding race and ethnicity during the Covid-19 pandemic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>UNITED STATES<|>George Floyd's death led to nationwide protests and discussions about racial injustice in the United States<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 OUTBREAK<|>UNITED STATES<|>The Covid-19 outbreak has had significant social and political impacts in the United States, including increased racial tensions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEW RESEARCH CENTRE<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Pew Research Centre's survey findings may reflect the political climate influenced by Donald Trump's presidency during the Covid-19 pandemic<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
