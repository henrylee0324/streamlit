Hundreds of incidents of harassment have been recorded in which similar\nterms were used.\n\"The tone in which Trump mocked Chinese people and joked about the pandemic really gave people license to\nalso attack the people, rather than criticise a government's policies,\" Jeung said. \"We're portrayed as\noutsiders and we need to have a greater sense that everyone can belong to the United States. It has a\ntangible impact.\"\nMany Chinese-American community organisers believe that having Asian-American figures in Biden's cabinet\nor in other high-level administration positions would serve as an important symbol. \"It would be great to see\nChinese and Asian-American appointees,\" said Leanna Louie, a founder of the United Peace Collaborative, a\nregistered non-profit organisation in San Francisco that has patrolled the city's Chinatown during the\npandemic.\n\"If other Asians see that someone, like [businessman and former presidential candidate] Andrew Yang was in\nthe cabinet, they'd think to get involved and help the community,\" she added.\n\"People need to think of the community as a whole rather than just themselves.\"\nTrump does have one Asian-American in his cabinet: Taiwan-born Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, a\nlong-time Republican figure who previously served as Secretary of Labor in the Bush administration. Last\nweek, Trump also nominated Chao, the wife of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, to the board of\ntrustees of the John F. Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts.\n\"Having an immigrant background doesn't mean you represent the interest of immigrants, or support those of\ndifferent class or racial backgrounds,\" Jeung said of Chao. \"She hasn't had much impact ... she either doesn't\nhave a voice on those issues in the administration or hasn't been a strong enough advocate.\"Looking ahead to the Biden administration, Jeung said that he believes that the presence of vice-president-\nelect Kamala Harris - whose mother was from India - will have a beneficial impact on Americans whosefamilies originated in other parts of Asia.\n\"She's the daughter of immigrants and talks about her mother. That makes a difference to the community.\nIt's not about having diversity for diversity's sake, it's about having a diverse cabinet that understands all the\ndifferent issues that we have to grapple with in the country,\" he said. \"Having a cabinet that reflects the\ncomplexity of America will only make the government stronger.\"\nLast Thursday, the Biden transition team announced that Katherine Tai, now the chief trade lawyer for the\nHouse Ways and Means Committee, would be nominated to the cabinet-level position of US trade\nrepresentative. If confirmed by the Senate, Tai, a Taiwanese-American, will be the first Asian-American to\nhold the position. \"I cannot stress the importance of naming Katie Tai as US trade representative,\" Jeung said.\n\"US-China relations have deteriorated to China-bashing, and subsequently physical bashings of Chinese\nand Asians in the US.\n\"Other Americans need to see an Asian-American public official representing the US, and building bridges,\nnot walls.\"\nEven if Biden were to immediately reverse Trump's immigration policies and soften his tone on China when\nhe takes office on January 20, experts warn that a higher level of anti-Chinese and anti-Asian sentiment is\nlikely to remain for years to come.\n\"Unfortunately, some of the damage has been done. Especially as we do not see a near-term resolution of\nCovid-19, there will be people that continue to blame Asian-Americans for the pandemic,\" Jeung said.\"Some of that hate isn't going to resolve itself immediately. That will cause tensions with respect to anti-\nAsian racism in the community,\" he added. \"But better rhetoric from the top is going to help immensely.\"Karlin Chan, a community activist and lifelong resident of New York's Chinatown who organises \"block\nwatch\" patrols to safeguard local residents, said that the anti-Asian sentiment of the Trump era is merely\nanother in a long series of difficult periods for the community in the United States.\n\"Once a monster rears its ugly head, it takes years to subside. It's like the ripples when you throw a big\nstone into a calm lake,\" he said. \"It will be years before we overcome this xenophobia.\"\nAs Joe Biden prepares to take the reins in Washington, the stakes have never been higher for the US\nrelationship with China and the rest of Asia.
