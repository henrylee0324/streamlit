system\nfor pandemic-related racist aggressions, and is working with Austin Public Health to track the data.\nThough the organization has not yet received any local reports, Executive Director Hailey Easley said\nshe believes the tool will be useful in tracking racism well after the pandemic.\n“I actually see this opening up,” Easley said. “I imagine that this could be helpful beyond
