An Indigenous community in New Mexico lacks adequate health care as the death toll mounts. A sick hospital worker in New\nJersey frets about infecting others in her heavily populated neighborhood.\nAs the country cries out for a vaccine and a return to normal, lost in the policy debates is the reality that COVID-19 kills far more people of color than white Americans. This isn't a matter of coincidence, poor choices or\nbad luck – it's by design.\nA team of USA TODAY reporters explored how the policies of the past and present have made Black, Asian, Hispanic and Indigenous Americans prime targets for COVID-19. They found:\nAmerica's education and economic systems are still unequal, disproportionately leaving people of color out of higher-wage jobs. When COVID-19 struck, more people of color were serving as essential workers directly in\nthe path of the virus.\nDecades of discrimination in housing corralled people of color into tightly packed neighborhoods, fueling the virus' spread. Those neighborhoods tend to lie in \"food deserts,\" leading to diabetes, obesity and heart\ndisease that make people more likely to die from the virus.\nEnvironmental policies designed by white power brokers at the expense of the poor have poisoned the air they breathe, fueling cancers and leaving communities weakened in the path of the virus. A lack of federal\nfunding left the most vulnerable communities cut off from health care at the most critical moment.\nPut simply, America's history of racism was itself a preexisting condition.\nOf the 10 U.S. counties with the highest death rates from COVID-19, seven have populations where people of color make up the majority, according to data compiled by USA TODAY. Of the top 50 counties with the\nhighest death rates, 31 are populated mostly by people of color.\n\"COVID-19 has brought out into the open, with painful clarity, these divisions in our society that have been there for a long time but, for one reason or another, people were able to overlook them,\" said Philip\nLandrigan, director of the Global Public Health Program at Boston College.\nWith nearly 1,000 people a day dying from the virus and scientists scrambling to grasp exactly how the virus spreads and kills, federal and state data has not provided enough demographic detail to show the full impact\non communities of color. The race and ethnicity of people who contract the virus is known in 52% of cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nBut study after study has shown clear patterns in whom the virus kills.\nBlack people are more than twice as likely to die from the virus than white people, and Hispanics and Native Americans are 1.5 times more likely to die, according to The COVID Tracking Project.\n\"You can't change the fact that America is so segregated and that people of color tend to live in communities where the environmental conditions are worse, and that can increase your risk of heart disease or lung\ndisease and diabetes,\" said Richard Besser, former acting director of the CDC and president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nation's largest philanthropy dedicated solely to health care. \"You can't\nchange that in the short run.\"\nA team of USA TODAY reporters pored over lawsuits challenging housing and health care policies, analyzed demographic data for communities hit hardest by COVID-19 and studied documents that reveal how\ngovernment and business leaders worked together to marginalize populations. They interviewed the descendants of enslaved Americans who were denied homeownership in white neighborhoods and Indigenous\nAmericans who had been funneled into reservations in exchange for federally funded health care that never came. They walked through Black communities on the fence line of polluting chemical plants, spent time with\nLatino farm workers unable to afford the very food they harvested, and entered the homes of Asian immigrants afraid of being attacked by neighbors if they tested positive for the coronavirus.\nHousing policies speed spread of virus\nIn Essex County, New Jersey, decades of housing policies, laws and unspoken pacts excluded communities of color from spacious suburbs and forced them to cram into poor, often neglected neighborhoods in the urban\ncore of Newark. Now, Essex has the 12th-highest death rate from COVID-19 in the country, according to data compiled by USA TODAY, fueled in large part by the high numbers of Black Americans living in segregated,\nlow-income neighborhoods.\nThat includes Ahou Yao, 40, a respiratory therapist at a local hospital who contracted COVID-19 in April and was forced to self-isolate in her bedroom in the two-bedroom apartment she shares with her husband and\ntwo young boys. She struggled from fever, shortness of breath and body aches and was unable to work for a month. Her husband had to go out for food, run errands and navigate their crowded neighborhood.\n\"Now I'm scared,\" she said, \"scared that he has it, too.\"\nHer husband has since developed a cough and chest pains, prompting a trip to the emergency room. He started self-isolating, passing the responsibility of venturing outside back to his wife.\nEnvironmental policies make people vulnerable\nIn Louisiana, along a stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, former slave plantations house massive chemical plants that spew chemicals deemed dangerous by the Environmental\nProtection Agency. When the plants were constructed, white homeowners had the means to move away, in time leaving a mostly Black population to breathe toxic air and suffer from such high rates of cancer that the\nentire region was dubbed \"Cancer Alley.\"\nOne of those plants, in St. John the Baptist Parish, is the only one in the nation that produces neoprene. The synthetic rubber is used to make wetsuits and laptop cases, and the emissions from the production process\nare so harmful that the EPA lists the predominantly Black neighborhood next door to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LOUISIANA<|>GEO<|>Louisiana is a state in the southern United States where a pastor prays for his parishioners affected by COVID-19 and cancer.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW MEXICO<|>GEO<|>New Mexico is a state in the southwestern United States facing health care inadequacies in Indigenous communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW JERSEY<|>GEO<|>New Jersey is a state in the northeastern United States where a hospital worker is concerned about infecting others in her neighborhood.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHILIP LANDRIGAN<|>PERSON<|>Philip Landrigan is the director of the Global Public Health Program at Boston College, who commented on the societal divisions exposed by COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHARD BESSER<|>PERSON<|>Richard Besser is the former acting director of the CDC and president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, discussing the impact of segregation on health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USA TODAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>USA TODAY is a news organization that reported on the disparities in COVID-19 death rates among communities of color.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER ALLEY<|>GEO<|>Cancer Alley is a region along the Mississippi River in Louisiana known for high cancer rates due to chemical plant emissions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESSEX COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Essex County is a county in New Jersey with a high COVID-19 death rate, largely due to its Black population living in segregated neighborhoods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AHOU YAO<|>PERSON<|>Ahou Yao is a 40-year-old respiratory therapist from Essex County who contracted COVID-19 and faced challenges in her crowded living situation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has disproportionately affected communities of color in the United States.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AHOU YAO<|>ESSEX COUNTY<|>Ahou Yao lives in Essex County, which has a high COVID-19 death rate affecting her and her family<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USA TODAY<|>PHILIP LANDRIGAN<|>USA TODAY reported on Philip Landrigan's insights regarding the societal divisions exacerbated by COVID-19<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USA TODAY<|>RICHARD BESSER<|>USA TODAY reported on Richard Besser's comments about the impact of segregation on health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOUISIANA<|>CANCER ALLEY<|>Louisiana is home to Cancer Alley, a region known for high cancer rates due to environmental policies<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW MEXICO<|>COVID-19<|>New Mexico's Indigenous communities are facing health care challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW JERSEY<|>COVID-19<|>New Jersey is experiencing significant impacts from COVID-19, affecting hospital workers and communities<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHILIP LANDRIGAN<|>COVID-19<|>Philip Landrigan discussed the societal divisions revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICHARD BESSER<|>COVID-19<|>Richard Besser highlighted the health disparities faced by communities of color during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
