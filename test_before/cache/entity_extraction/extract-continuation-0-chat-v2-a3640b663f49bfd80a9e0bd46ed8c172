After rescheduling his flight\nfive times, Steven decided it was just not worth the trouble.\n\"Of course, there were scalpers selling tickets but these were going for nearly 100,000 yuan (S$20,600), it's\nridiculous especially when you know someone else is profiteering from this,\" he told The Straits Times.\nBut remaining in the US has led to other challenges; the high school senior has been unable to take the SATs,\nusually a requirement for university applications in the country.\n\"In theory we could drive four hours to the nearest town where there's an open test centre, but I don't have a\ndriver's licence or a car, and the bus does not start till dawn.\nRelated Story\nUS revokes visas for 1,000 Chinese under Trump order; China accuses Washington of political\npersecution\nRelated Story\nUS blocking visas of some Chinese graduate students and researchers\n\"Staying overnight is not an option because we are below the minimum age of 21 for unaccompanied hotel\nstays.
