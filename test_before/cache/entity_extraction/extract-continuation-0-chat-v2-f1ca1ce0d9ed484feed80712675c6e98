The Governor of California,\nGavin Newsom, said he had seen a \"huge increase\" in assaults against Asian Americans in his state.\nIn an effort to document the crimes, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council set up a website called Stop\nAAPI Hate on which people can report assaults. AAPI stands for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\"I want to point out how prevalent assaults are (against Chinese) in the New York area,\" Cheng said. \"It even\nhappened to my assistant, who is Malaysian Chinese, and her partner, who were both thrown to the ground.\n\"Her revenge was that she got to be on the front page of the New York Post, and they did catch the assailant\ntwo months later. Another thing that I was shocked to see was that in Rockville, Maryland, most gun buyers in\nMarch were Chinese Americans. This is how afraid Americans are.\"\nUS President Donald Trump and his allies have repeatedly been criticized for branding COVID-19 \"the Chinese\nvirus\".\nAll of the panelists agreed that it was important for Asians to support each other and other ethnic groups facing\nracial abuse, particularly in the wake of nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd, who died in\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25 when a police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes.\nbelindarobinson@chinadailyusa.com\nCredit: Belinda Robinson in New York\nCopyright China Daily Aug 10, 2020\nFour prominent Asian Americans says prejudice, racism and physical attacks against their community have\nincreased at alarming rates over assertions that Chinese people are responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Whenever there is a contentious relationship with any part of Asia from the United States, the racism inside the\nUnited States goes up against Asians,\" said Jerry Yang, co-founder and former chief executive of Yahoo! \"We are\nat such a moment, in my belief.\"\nYang made his remarks at a virtual event organized by the National Committee on United States-China Relations\non Wednesday.
