The synthetic rubber is used to make wetsuits and laptop cases, and the emissions from the production process are so harmful that the EPA lists the predominantly Black neighborhood next door to the plant as having the highest risk of cancer in the entire country. In September, St. John the Baptist Parish had the 27th highest death rate from COVID-19 in the nation, according to a USA TODAY analysis.The Rev. Lionel Murphy of the Tchoupitoulas Chapel, which sits 2 miles from the chloroprene plant, has counseled many Black families over the years as they’ve come down with diabetes, respiratory illnesses and rare cancers. Now, he’s seeing his neighbors die from COVID-19. And still, smoke billows from the plant down the road.\"People get sick, people die, you go bury them,\" Murphy said. \"But there’s no fight to erase the problem.\"Health care missing when neededIn McKinley County, New Mexico, many locals struggle to find health care.Year after year, Congress has failed to allocate enough money to fulfill its legal obligation to provide health care to Indigenous tribes, including the Navajo, Hopi and Zuni people who make up the majority of McKinley County’s population. A 2018 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights titled \"Broken Promises\" found the federal government spends nearly four times as much on health per person through government programs than it spends for each Indigenous person.Anna Marie Rondon, executive director of the New Mexico Social Justice and Equity Institute in McKinley County (who is Diné, as the Navajo people call themselves), said the ravages of COVID-19 are not an isolated tragedy but the latest chapter in Indigenous people’s long history of abuse and neglect from the U.S. government.On the Navajo Nation, inadequate resources have resulted in widespread water poverty, food insecurity and high rates of illness. These daily realities were devastating long before the pandemic, but they’ve also helped fuel a high COVID-19 death rate.\"It's really an unbelievable chain of oppression – it's still squeezing us, it still has its grip,\" Rondon said. \"And it's still killing us.\"Food deserts make people vulnerableIn California, Imperial Valley is considered the nation’s winter breadbasket, producing 80% of the country’s fresh vegetables during the cold months. But the predominantly Hispanic workers who pick alfalfa, lettuce, sugar beets and carrots can rarely afford to buy them.Nearly 75% of adults and 13% of children are obese or overweight for their age, according to state data. On the other end of the spectrum, 31% of kids in Imperial County don't get enough to eat each day, according to a 2018 report by Feeding America, a national anti-hunger organization based in Washington, D.C.\"If they're already on food stamps, to spend the extra money to get fruits and vegetables, it's expensive,\" said Jessica Solorio, executive director of Spread the Love, a local food bank.Those figures show why COVID-19 has been so fatal in the county, with 16 deaths per 10,000, nearly three times the national average, according to the USA TODAY analysis.Cultural barriers complicate responseIn San Francisco, community activists are worried that the number of Asian Americans getting COVID-19 is being vastly underreported.Of the county’s nearly 12,000 positive test results, only 12% are Asian American, yet Asian Americans have made up 38% of the death count. Experts attribute that alarming disconnect to a number of factors, including the fear of losing a job after a positive test, language barriers, lack of health care, growing anti-Asian hate crimes, and what’s called the \"model-minority myth\" – an assumption that education and financial successes enjoyed by some Asian Americans applies to all 20-some Asian ethnicities.Judy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a nonprofit that helps residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, said her community suffers from an average household income a quarter of the city’s average, low high school graduation rates and obstacles to health care. Add a COVID-19 testing regime tailored to those proficient in English and an often fatalistic attitude toward the pandemic in the community, and Young said the virus has been painful to the Asian American community.\"I've asked our clients why they're not getting tested,\" she said. \"Often the reaction I get is, 'I'm going to die anyway, and if I test positive, then I can't go to work.\"'We become invisible'Ask Beverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, why so many people of color across the U.S. are dying from COVID-19 and she goes back 400 years to the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to colonial U.S. shores.Racism is so entrenched in the American way of life, she said, that it's impossible to separate the high death rates of marginalized communities from the nation’s historic treatment of each of them. From the broken promises of reparations to the terrible treatment of immigrants, from redlining practices that excluded Black Americans from homeownership to the GI Bill money that went mostly to white service members returning from World War II, Wright says COVID-19 is once again revealing the precarious position people of color often find themselves in.But with no national response from the federal government and only limited actions taken by states or localities, Wright said her people are still stuck in the same situation: invisible.\"We have built-in systems that work against Black people moving up the economic ladder,\" Wright said. \"That pattern continues.\"Racism is so entrenched that we become invisible.\"MORE IN THIS SERIESRacism turned their neighborhood into 'Cancer Alley\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ST.
