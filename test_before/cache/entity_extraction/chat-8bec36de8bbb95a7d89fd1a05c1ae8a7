I need out.\nI'm in rehab.\nApril 6th will be 18 months clean from shooting up. You guys are such a great inspiration.\nMs. Kamer, 32, wrote one: Did 2 years in prison. Haven't seen my son in 3.5 years, been clean 27 months. He is a huge motivation on why I'm still clean! #goals\nIt was one voice in an ocean.\nI got 31 days.\nFirst time watcher.\nI am so close to breaking.\n-- Dan Levin\nLos Angeles\nThe schedule promised a matchup between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies. But Dodger Stadium is empty, its doors locked shut, and outside, the birds are\nlouder than what is left of traffic in one of America's most congested cities.\nAll the familiar faces are somewhere else. The guys hawking T-shirts, the guys selling beers out of coolers, the guys scalping tickets, the women cooking bacon-wrapped hot\ndogs just before the final uphill into the stadium parking lots, blocked off with signs that now say \"No public access.\"\nSolitary joggers passed by, one after another, under billboards advertising season tickets for a season in limbo. A man in a surgical mask walked his pug.\nAlex Wood, the 29-year-old left-hander, was scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers. Right about now, the Rockies would be finishing batting practice, and Mr. Wood would be in the\nclubhouse going over the game plan with his catcher and pitching coach. Instead, he's a few hundred miles away in Arizona, crashing at a teammate's house. He said he was\nthrowing most days, and just trying to maintain \"some semblance of sanity.\"\nDuring what would have been game time, he said, he was doing pretty much what every other American was doing. Eating. Watching television. Sleeping.\nMr. Wood counseled patience for frustrated fans. \"Let that excitement continue to build,\" he said, \"and let it loose once we start our season.\"\n-- Tim Arango\nNorth Kansas City, Mo.\nDonna Danahy was sitting on a mattress in a hotel just off the interstate, queasy from the rising waves of dread and uncertainty.\nMs. Danahy, 58, lost her job as a server at Steak 'n Shake a couple of weeks back when it moved to drive-through only. With that, she lost the income needed to pay the first\nmonth's rent -- $600 -- on what was supposed to be a new studio apartment.\nA co-worker she had been staying with left town, leaving Ms. Danahy homeless. For several days she parked her 2006 Toyota Camry in a truck stop, drawing down curtains\nattached with Velcro, sliding a sun visor in the windshield and tucking her 5-foot-1-inch frame into the back seat for a nerve-racking attempt at sleep. Sometimes she closed her\neyes and wished she would never wake up. Sometimes she was hard on herself for not securing a more stable existence.\n\"Leading up to this, I felt all this was self-induced; I did this to myself,\" she said.\nThe plan had been to move into the new place on April 1. But the landlord told Ms. Danahy she would release her unit if she could not come up with the money by April 14. She\nwas hired for a $13-an-hour job at a grocery store deli but could not start until she got her birth certificate, which was on its way in the mail.\nA social services organization secured her the hotel room for a week. But what would she do once the week was up? She began to cry. It was hard not to feel vulnerable. She\nhas asthma. She wondered if she would get infected from all the moving around.\n-- John Eligon\nKirkland, Wash.\nTammy Wiatrowski curled up on a lilac sectional with a writing tray and a floral-patterned journal.\nShe has been writing in it since early March, after working 57 hours over four days as a charge nurse in a critical care unit. It had dealt with the first spate of the nation's\ndeaths, a crunch of supplies, quarantined employees and a dire uncertainty.\n\"As the weekend went on and more patients lost their battle with the virus, I realized both my daughters and all 5 of my grandkids could get this and might not survive.\"\nShe told her daughters that weekend that it might be months before they could spend time together. Her home has been quiet ever since. No slumber parties. The Nerf guns sit\nunused. The video game console is off. Ms. Wiatrowski has instead gone shopping, leaving groceries at her daughter's doorstep and stepping back\"Only to be able to wave as she opened the door. Telling them 'I love them!' My grandson saying, 'It's OK, Granny, I can give you an invisible hug!' as he stretched his arms out\n...\"\nFor the first time in 14 years, her job has distanced her from the ones she loves. It is the same for her patients.\nMs. Wiatrowski cannot bring families in to hold hands during the last breaths. She cannot wrap her arms around those who are in grief. She cannot help them get a talisman,\nlike a lock of hair or an EKG strip.\n\"I can't even give them a piece of paper with their heartbeat without feeling like it's contaminated. Now everything feels contaminated.\"\n-- Mike Baker\nBerkeley, Calif.\nIn the manner of academic scientists\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
