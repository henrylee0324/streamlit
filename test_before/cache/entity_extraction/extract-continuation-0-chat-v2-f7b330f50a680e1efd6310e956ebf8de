He said Chinese Americans and other Kentuckians of Asian descent feel they are being blamed for a global pandemic.\nWang said he hasn't heard about any violence or verbal threats in Lexington, which has an Asian population of less than 4%, according to census data. But he is troubled by the national headlines coming from parts of the country where more Asian Americans live.\nThe Kentuckian pleaded with McConnell and others to think about the consequences of Trump's language.\n\"What is the difference if you just call it coronavirus versus 'Chinese virus?'\" Wang asked. \"He could have avoided this entire mess but he did not choose to do so.\"\nMcConnell certainly didn't bite his tongue when past players in Kentucky politics have used this race card to animate their attacks against him.\nDuring the 2014 Senate campaign, a liberal super PAC called Progress Kentucky alluded to his wife Elaine Chao — who now serves as Trump's transportation secretary — and her Chinese background when criticizing McConnell about letting U.S. jobs move overseas.\nThe McConnell campaign fired back quickly at the time, and blasted the group for \"race-baiting\" voters. It did the same when a Democratic consultant referred to Chao, who came to the U.S. from China as a child, as being Asian and not a native Kentuckian.\nTeam Mitch had zilch to say when asked about Trump's \"Chinese virus\" comments this week, even as old foes acknowledge the mistake.\n\"The senator and secretary were on the right side of history in calling out Progress Kentucky's racist tweets, just as I was on the wrong side for trivializing the harm they caused,\" said Curtis Morrison, an attorney and former Progress Kentucky volunteer. \"It is sad to watch now as they tolerate the same racism when it comes from the president.\"\nMorrison figures Trump is just too powerful and too important for McConnell to criticize in public.\nThe GOP leader didn't refrain from calling out Republican Everett Corley two years ago when it was discovered the small-time state legislative candidate appeared on a white nationalist radio show where the host criticized McConnell's interracial marriage.\n\"This racist behavior is completely despicable,\" McConnell said in 2018. \"Such backwards views and hateful rhetoric must be given no corner in the Republican Party or anywhere in America.\"\nPandemic challenges underdogs\nSenate Democratic candidates Charles Booker and Mike Broihier were already long shots in the primary battle against presumed front-runner Amy McGrath, and the COVID-19 pandemic gives them a new hurdle.\nAcross the country, lesser-known candidates are having to ditch door-knocking and direct voter contact. But Booker and Broihier argue the pandemic only changes how people can support them as they shift to the digital realm.\nBooker, a state legislator from Louisville, is taking a family-friendly approach while still delivering body blows to McConnell's leadership.\n\"If you're stuck in the house like we are, why not have a dance party!\" Booker said in a Wednesday tweet featuring a video with one of his two daughters. \"I know this is a tough time for all of us. So much fear, so much uncertainty. While we fight to weather this time, my hope is that you can still find joy in the little things. My girls do that for me!\"\nBooker branded himself early as a candidate fueled by grassroots progressives who understood his personal story as a Type 1 diabetic who lost his cousin to gun violence. The virus is forcing him to campaign remotely at a time when close contact with voters and large rallies are discouraged or outright forbidden.\n\"This movement has always been about meeting people where they are and breaking down barriers to getting involved,\" Booker said in a news release announcing the decision. \"That is what has set our campaign apart to date, and the steps we are taking now are just further proof of our commitment to disrupting the status quo and elevating the voices of every Kentuckian.\"\nBroihier, a retired Marine, is taking advantage by having a nightly online program at 7 across all social media platforms broadcast from his Lincoln County farm.\nThe program features union leaders, grassroots organizers and average Kentuckians who want to air their concerns.\nBroihier also is running digital ads aimed at McConnell that are much fiercer than any Booker or McGrath have aired.\n\"Only the fear of losing his reelection got 'Corona Mitch' to finally do the right by the American people,\" he said in a March 19 tweet featuring a new online spot.\n\"If Mitch McConnell needs to be scared\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MITCH MCCONNELL<|>PERSON<|>Mitch McConnell is the Senate Majority Leader who has been criticized for his response to anti-Asian rhetoric and is spearheading a relief package for Kentuckians during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEPHANIE PENN<|>PERSON<|>Stephanie Penn is a spokeswoman for Mitch McConnell, who commented on the senator's leadership during the health and economic challenges posed by COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States, whose use of terms like \"China virus\" has been criticized for inciting racism against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHIZHI \"WIT\" WANG<|>PERSON<|>Zhizhi \"Wit\" Wang is a University of Kentucky graduate student who has expressed concern over the impact of Trump's language on Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROGRESS KENTUCKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Progress Kentucky is a liberal super PAC that has been criticized for race-baiting tactics in political campaigns, particularly against Mitch McConnell.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES BOOKER<|>PERSON<|>Charles Booker is a Democratic candidate for the Senate from Kentucky, known for his grassroots campaign and personal story as a Type 1 diabetic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIKE BROIHIER<|>PERSON<|>Mike Broihier is a retired Marine and Democratic candidate for the Senate from Kentucky, who is utilizing online platforms to connect with voters during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has significantly impacted political campaigning and public health in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KENTUCKY<|>GEO<|>Kentucky is a U.S. state where the political events and campaigns discussed are taking place, particularly in the context of the Senate race.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MITCH MCCONNELL<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Mitch McConnell has been criticized for not publicly denouncing Donald Trump's use of racially charged language regarding COVID-19<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEPHANIE PENN<|>MITCH MCCONNELL<|>Stephanie Penn represents Mitch McConnell's office and speaks on his behalf regarding the COVID-19 relief efforts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZHIZHI \"WIT\" WANG<|>MITCH MCCONNELL<|>Zhizhi \"Wit\" Wang has criticized Mitch McConnell for not addressing the implications of Trump's language on Asian Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROGRESS KENTUCKY<|>MITCH MCCONNELL<|>Progress Kentucky has previously targeted Mitch McConnell with racially charged criticisms related to his wife's background<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES BOOKER<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Charles Booker is adapting his campaign strategies in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIKE BROIHIER<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Mike Broihier is using online platforms to engage with voters due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES BOOKER<|>MITCH MCCONNELL<|>Charles Booker is running against Mitch McConnell in the Senate race, criticizing his leadership during the pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIKE BROIHIER<|>MITCH MCCONNELL<|>Mike Broihier is a Democratic candidate challenging Mitch McConnell in the Senate race, focusing on his response to the pandemic<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
