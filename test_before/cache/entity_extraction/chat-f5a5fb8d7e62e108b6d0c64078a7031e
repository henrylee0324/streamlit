Bancroft never considered\nthat he might be experiencing anxiety, triggered by his own discomfort with something unfamiliar.\nInstead, he speculated \"whether a Chinaman's lungs are not formed on a different principle from ours ... He\ncertainly seems to thrive in stench where others would suffocate.\" Attributing Chinatown's poor air quality to\ncultural and biological differences, so-called experts like Bancroft drew attention away from the forces of mob\nviolence, poverty, social marginalization, and housing inequity that had pushed Chinese immigrants into\nsubstandard living conditions.\nBecause culture plays a powerful role in shaping olfactory responses, I have been studying how American\nnarratives spread — and sometimes challenge — these ideas about Chinese air. Stories about Chinese stench\ndate back to the first decades of Chinese immigration. In the 1860s, Mark Twain wrote about a San Francisco\ndetective who could smell a chicken feather from a crime scene and \"tell which block in Sacramento street the\nChinaman lives in who committed it.\"\nThe Yellow Peril has a smell in Frank Norris's novel Moran of the Lady Letty, in which a white woman is held\ncaptive by a crew of reeking Chinese pirates. In Sax Rohmer's The Insidious Fu Manchu, published in 1913,\nthe first Asiatic supervillain attacks detectives with a mysterious poison gas, which leaves \"no clew-remaining\n— except the smell.\" By the time Raymond Chandler wrote that a character \"had a sort of dry musty smell,\nlike a fairly clean Chinaman,\" \"Chinese\" had become a metaphor for stench.\nEdith Maude Eaton, a mixed-race Canadian writer of the late 19th and early 20th centuries who has been\ncalled the mother of Asian American literature, fought this pattern of olfactory stereotyping in her stories\nabout domestic life in several urban Chinatowns. Writing under the pen-name Sui Sin Far (\"Chinese water\nflower\") and titling her book Mrs. Spring Fragrance, she associated Chinese immigrants with pleasant smells.\nWhen they could afford to, Eaton suggested, Chinese immigrants preferred a cool and fragrant atmosphere:\n\"After the heat and dust and unsavoriness of the highways and byways of Chinatown, the young reporter who\nhad been sent to find a story, had stepped across the threshold of a cool, deep room, fragrant with the odor\nof dried lilies and sandalwood, and found Pan.\"\nWhere the natural aromas of lilies and sandalwood indicate the careful housekeeping of the Chinese family,\nthe smell of the streets was the result of the city's failure — or refusal — to fulfill its responsibility of cleaning\nChinatown's streets.\nThe contemporary artist Anicka Yi took a more direct approach to olfactory racism in her 2017 Guggenheim\nMuseum exhibition, Life is Cheap. The first installation consisted of three gas canisters emitting a blend of\nodors sourced from both a colony of ants and from Manhattan's Chinatown and Koreatown.\nThe main gallery featured two dioramas Yi created by using visually captivating bacterial cultures sourced\nfrom the same neighborhoods, and the same colony of ants inhabiting an enlarged circuit board. The piece is\na meditation on Asian stereotypes and Western dependence on inexpensive Asian imports.\nNot unlike Fu Manchu's gas attack, the scents Yi works with — which she describes as vegetal, floral, citrusy,\nand meaty — insidiously penetrate the bodies of visitors. But the museum setting recasts the smells of Asian\nneighborhoods as an unusual olfactory experience, something to be sought after rather than avoided. Yi hints\nthat inhaling the scents of Chinatown, Koreatown, and ants might predispose her audience to perceive their\nconnections with the beautiful forms presented in her living dioramas.\nLife is Cheap asks how smells usually thought of as foreign are already part of us, whether as bacteria\ninhabiting our bodies or as fumes emitted in the course of producing our computers and phones. After all,\nChina's industry and urban development are intimately connected with the U.S. addiction to cheap\ntechnology.\nAnd, like the perceived unsavoriness of Chinatown streets, the conditions that promote COVID-19 are part of\nsomething much bigger than a wet market in Wuhan. Chinese air is not made in China, it is an exhalation of\nthe global economy.\nHsuan L.
