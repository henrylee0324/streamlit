This\nmatter has been referred to UC's Office of Equal Opportunity and Access (\"OEOA\") for review. As such, effective\nimmediately you are being placed on an administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of that review,\" the\nemail reads.\nUcker's \"full cooperation\" with the OEOA review is \"both expected and appreciated,\" Weidner wrote.\nWeidner began investigating after third-year engineering student Evan Sotzing, 20, posted on social media an\nemail he received from Ucker. The email came after Sotzing had to miss a lab session due to being quarantined\nfor possible exposure to the coronavirus.\n\"For students testing positive for the chinese (sic) virus, I will give no grade,\" the email reads. \"You can read the\ninfo I sent to the class re: the torsion test.\"\nSotzing's post on Twitter had over 37,500 retweets and more than 166,500 likes as of Tuesday evening.\n\"I think that the school should take disciplinary actions against the professor because (his) actions completely\nviolate the school's values,\" Sotzing previously told The Enquirer.\nSotzing said he is not clear whether Ucker's message meant he was getting a zero grade or if the professor is\nmerely not grading the assignment. He said he was offended by what he called \"racist language\" from Ucker in\nthe email, and the notion that Ucker might punish a student for adhering to national, state and local health\nguidelines.\nThe following morning, Weidner confirmed that the matter was referred for review to the OEOA. That\ndepartment handles inquiries regarding discrimination, harassment or retaliation based on disability, race, color,\nreligion, national origin and other identities, according to its website.\n\"These types of xenophobic comments and stigmatizations around location or ethnicity are more than troubling.\nWe can better protect and care for all when we speak about COVID-19 with both accuracy and empathy –\nsomething we should all strive for,\" Weidner wrote to The Enquirer.\nNews of the investigation came on the same day that the U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure\ncondemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIncreased numbers of Asian Americans have reported harassment and even physical assaults amid political\nrhetoric blaming China for the pandemic from President Donald Trump and others.\nThe House measure, a nonbinding resolution, does not require the Senate to pass it, nor does it require the\npresident's signature.\nAccording to Ucker's personnel file, he has taught at the university since 1996. A letter sent in August states\nUcker was offered an adjunct position in the College of Engineering and Applied Science effective Aug. 24\nthrough Dec. 12, and compensated $3,600 for the semester.\nThe letter states three requirements Ucker is expected to fulfill: to hold two office hours per week; not to miss\nany classes; and to \"do a good job teaching and taking care of the students.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Cincinnati is an educational institution where John Ucker is employed as a professor in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN UCKER<|>PERSON<|>John Ucker is an adjunct instructor at the University of Cincinnati who has been placed on administrative leave due to concerns raised about his email regarding COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN WEIDNER<|>PERSON<|>John Weidner is the Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the University of Cincinnati who communicated with John Ucker regarding the administrative leave.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVAN SOTZING<|>PERSON<|>Evan Sotzing is a third-year engineering student at the University of Cincinnati who raised concerns about John Ucker's email and posted about it on social media.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OEOA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Office of Equal Opportunity and Access (OEOA) at the University of Cincinnati handles inquiries regarding discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has led to various health guidelines and concerns, including the context of John Ucker's email.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The U.S. House of Representatives is the legislative body that passed a measure condemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTI-ASIAN BIGOTRY<|>EVENT<|>Anti-Asian bigotry refers to the discrimination and harassment faced by Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbated by political rhetoric.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN UCKER<|>UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI<|>John Ucker is a professor at the University of Cincinnati who has been placed on administrative leave by the institution<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN WEIDNER<|>JOHN UCKER<|>John Weidner, as Dean, communicated with John Ucker regarding his administrative leave<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVAN SOTZING<|>JOHN UCKER<|>Evan Sotzing raised concerns about John Ucker's email and posted about it on social media<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN UCKER<|>OEOA<|>John Ucker's case has been referred to the OEOA for review due to concerns raised about his email<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>ANTI-ASIAN BIGOTRY<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased reports of anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<|>ANTI-ASIAN BIGOTRY<|>The U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure condemning anti-Asian bigotry during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
