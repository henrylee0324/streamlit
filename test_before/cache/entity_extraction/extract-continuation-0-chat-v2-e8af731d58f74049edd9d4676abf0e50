Donald Trump,\nthe former President, inflamed the hatred by labeling COVID-19 \"the China virus\" and \"Kung flu\" while blaming the Chinese for the death-ravaging outbreaks in America.\nIn New York, reported hate crimes involving Asian American victims increased over 900% in 2020 - from 3 to\n28.\n\"We are tired of being told that we don't experience racism, we are tired of being told to keep our heads down\nand not make trouble,\" Lin wrote. \"We are tired of Asian American kids growing up and being asked where\nthey're REALLY from, of having our eyes mocked, of being objectified as exotic or being told we're inherently\nunattractive. We are tired of the stereotypes in Hollywood affecting our psyche and limiting who we think we can\nbe. We are tired of being invisible, of being mistaken for our colleague or told our struggles aren't as real.\"\nLin was the first American-born NBA player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent when he played for the Warriors in\n2010-11.
