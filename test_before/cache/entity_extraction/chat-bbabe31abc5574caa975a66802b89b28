The think tank found nearly 13% of Asian American senior citizens live in poverty compared to a 9% national average.Discrimination also is keeping some Asian Americans from getting tested for COVID-19. The website Stop AAPI Hate, the acronym for Asian American Pacific Islander, has logged more than 2,500 incidents of discrimination across the U.S. since mid-March. The attacks have ranged from verbal assaults to acts of physical violence.When Asian Americans hear President Donald Trump, who contracted COVID-19 in October, repeatedly call the virus the \"China virus\" and \"Kung Flu,\" \"it makes them less likely to seek help, a bit like early in the AIDS epidemic when the gay community was stigmatized,\" said Karthick Ramakrishnan, professor of public policy at the University of California, Riverside and chair of the California Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander American Affairs.Decades of racist policiesChinese citizens began passing through San Francisco's then bridgeless Golden Gate en masse during the Gold Rush of 1849.By the late 1800s, the Chinese were not just vilified but outright barred from entering the country, with few exceptions, by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. White officials charged they were taking jobs from other Americans, despite having been integral to the Gold Rush's boom and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad.At the height of World War II, Japanese Americans around the country were rounded up and sent to internment camps, feared as the traitorous \"yellow peril\" after years of citizenship. Despite painful and humiliating treatment at the hands of the U.S. government, many Asians resolved to engrain themselves in the society at large with an image of themselves as patriotic, hardworking Americans.The model minority image gained momentum during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Asian American success stories were highlighted by white U.S. officials both as a way of signaling to other nations, namely the Soviet Union, that America was not racist, but also to shame other ethnic groups, notably Black Americans.The logic went that if Asian Americans were doing so well, surely failure on the part of other ethnic groups was their own fault.Then came the Vietnam War, a quagmire that resulted in a U.S.-sponsored evacuation of 125,000 refugees followed by countless others who escaped Southeast Asia in rickety boats. Many landed in San Francisco.California Assemblymember David Chiu, a Democrat who represents the eastern half of San Francisco and chairs the California Asian & Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, said lawmakers must recognize that Asian Americans are a loosely linked group of immigrants with distinct challenges and needs.\"The attention being paid to the disparities endured during the pandemic by Black and Latinos is important, but our issue hasn't gotten the attention it deserves,\" he said.One small demographic victory for Asian Americans came in 1997 when President Bill Clinton directed the Office of Management and Budget to expand its data classification system to break out \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders\" from the Asian American group. That geographic list includes countries such as Micronesia, Tonga, Vanuatu, Guam, the Marshall Islands and Fiji.As a result, we know today that Pacific Islanders rank third in terms of COVID-19 deaths, behind Native Americans and Black Americans.A COVID-19 language barrierAsian American communities in San Francisco speak a range of languages including Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Laotian, Samoan, Tongan, Vietnamese and Hindi. The city's website notes that COVID-19 information is available in English, Chinese, Filipino and Spanish.Efforts by city health officials to inform Asian residents about COVID-19 safety precautions and testing in their native languages have sometimes resulted in confusing or alienating translations.For example, information about pop-up virus testing sites sometimes can come across as demands, while in other cases the language is just plain confusing.One flyer written in the Filipino language of Tagalog told people to \"cover their entire face,\" said Luisa Antonio, executive director of the Bayanihan Equity Center, a Filipino American support group.Department of Public Health officials declined an interview request about outreach efforts.In California, about 5 million of 40 million state residents are Asian American, and in three-quarters of those homes, languages other than English are spoken regularly, according to the U.S. Census.Even some Asian Americans who speak fluent English said government officials have not made it easy to get information about the virus.Huiting \"Rita\" Huang grew alarmed when her mother-in-law told her that there had been a positive coronavirus case among the Chinese emigres to whom she was providing nursing services. The mother-in-law was unsure what to do and feared her poor English would make getting information about where to get tested even harder.Huang felt confident she could help. Her English was solid and she had experience getting COVID-19 information as a project coordinator and health educator for the nonprofit NICOS Chinese Health Coalition.After pursuing a series of online testing-site leads through a variety of city- and community-run websites – all requiring fluency in English – Huang soon learned that there were no available appointments at testing facilities close to their neighborhood.Huang eventually found a city-run testing site near Pier 30 along San Francisco Bay. The test was negative.\"That was frustrating for me, and I speak English,\" said Huang. \"I can't imagine what it would be like for someone like my mother-in-law.\"Some refuse to get testedAsian activists and health care workers trying to fill the void said they face a population that often is wary of Western medicine, fatalistic about getting the virus, culturally averse to passing along bad news to elders and nervous about losing employment.Kent Woo, executive director of the NICOS Chinese Health Coalition, said residents sometimes are suspicious of health care workers when they visit\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
