Newly released video shows one of the latest disturbing assaults. A 67-year-old man\nattacked by three people in a San Francisco Laundromat. The racism, though, has been fuelled not just by the\npandemic, but by politics. Here's CTV's Washington bureau chief Joy Malbon.\nJOY MALBON (Reporter): At his tea shop in Washington, Yunhan Zhang worries who will come through the door\nnext. Last November, a man attacked him with pepper spray, yelling \"Chinese,\" \"COVID.\" The assault left him\nchoking, angry, and sad, blaming an increase of anti-Asian racism in part on the words of Donald Trump.\nDONALD TRUMP (Former US President): Some people call it the Chinese flu.\nTRUMP: China virus.\nTRUMP: Kung flu.\nYUNHAN ZHANG (Valley Brooke Tea Owner): When leaders say those things, they lift that very thin layer of\nprotection. All the bigotry, all the hatred can just be unleashed like that.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Asian piece of [Bleep]\nMALBON: A surge of attacks caught on video. A grandmother punched and robbed in California. This man\nbrutally slashed in the face on the New York subway. And a grandfather in his San Francisco neighbourhood\nbeaten so badly he later died.\nMONTHANUS RATANAPAKDEE (Daughter): He never wake up again. I never see him again.\nMALBON: Advocacy groups tracked 3,000 hate incidents against Asian-Americans since March to December last\nyear. And it's happening in Canada, too. Despite a much smaller population, at least 1,000 incidents reported.\nAMY GO (Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice): We have higher ratio of racist attacks.\nMALBON: Amy Go is fourth generation Canadian, but one year into the COVID crisis, even she feels unsafe.\nGO: We were blamed to bring SARS to Canada, just like we are blamed for bringing COVID to Canada. We are\ndefinitely seen as foreigners. That's why we are told to go back to China.\nMALBON: Now prominent Asian-American stars are speaking out.\nDANIEL DAE KIM (Actor): We're so tired of having to say we are American.\nMALBON: Former Raptors' player Jeremy Lin wrote about being called coronavirus on the court.\nJEREMY LIN (Professional Basketball Player): My teammates heard it. Their teammates heard it. Nobody did\nanything.\nMALBON: President Joe Biden specifically condemned racism against Asian-Americans in an executive order. And\nwhile it's a start, advocates say these attacks must be treated more seriously. Lisa.\nLAFLAMME: So true. All right, Joy Malbon in Washington tonight.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
