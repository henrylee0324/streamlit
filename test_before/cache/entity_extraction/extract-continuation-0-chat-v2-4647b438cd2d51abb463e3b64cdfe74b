We’re children of immigrants nail salon techs and sandwich shop owners. \nWe’re resilient. We keep our heads low work hard and rarely complain. We’ve learned to not take up space to not step on toes.\nBut no more.\n\nWhy words matter: Biden is changing the tone after Trump's COVID rhetoric\n\nWe will not appease nor dismiss the well-camouflaged racism and xenophobia finally spewing out to the top. My generation and the generations after me will unlearn teachings of silence and accommodation our parents had to pick up to survive here. We refuse to fit into the deceivingly adorned yet inhumane mold of a model minority and a fetishized object. \nWe will speak up for those who no longer can. On Tuesday six Asian women were violently murdered in Georgia. You may have seen a number but we saw our moms our grandmas and our friends in those names.\n\nStand together to fight anti-Asian hate: We all have a stake in a more inclusive America.\n\nWhile the world argued away at the murderer’s exact motivation we saw the way it broke our community. While newsrooms and courtrooms tried to define a hate crime we saw security and safety being ripped away from our families. \nWhile you fought and debated we wept.\nHis name his story and his intentions are plastered everywhere but what the world didn’t see is the panicked phone calls we made to our parents. Our blank stares trying to fight back tears at work and school the next day. \nWhat you didn’t hear is the deep grieving and anger we aren’t used to expressing outwardly. Our words fumbling with long pauses in between because we’re learning what it means to finally take up space and be comfortable with it.\nWe’re resilient. We’re children of immigrants.\nAnd we won’t be silent anymore.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in Georgia where a tragic shooting incident occurred, resulting in the deaths of eight people, six of whom were Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is a U.S. state where the Atlanta shootings took place, highlighting issues of racism and violence against the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USA TODAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>USA Today is a news organization that reported on the Atlanta shootings and the subsequent reactions from the community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States, who is mentioned in the context of changing the tone regarding racism and xenophobia after the shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States, referenced in relation to his COVID rhetoric and its impact on societal attitudes towards Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN WOMEN<|>PERSON<|>Asian women are the victims of the Atlanta shootings, representing a community that has faced increased violence and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURDERER<|>PERSON<|>The gunman responsible for the Atlanta shootings, whose motivations are discussed in the context of societal racism and violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTI-ASIAN HATE<|>EVENT<|>Anti-Asian hate refers to the rising incidents of violence and discrimination against Asian Americans, particularly highlighted by the Atlanta shootings.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDEN<|>TRUMP<|>Biden is changing the tone of discourse on racism and xenophobia in contrast to Trump's previous rhetoric during his presidency<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEORGIA<|>Atlanta is a city located within the state of Georgia, where the shootings occurred<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USA TODAY<|>ATLANTA<|>USA Today reported on the Atlanta shootings, bringing attention to the incident and its implications<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN WOMEN<|>MURDERER<|>The murderer was responsible for the violent deaths of six Asian women in the Atlanta shootings<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTI-ASIAN HATE<|>ASIAN WOMEN<|>The incident of anti-Asian hate is exemplified by the violent murders of Asian women in Atlanta<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDEN<|>ANTI-ASIAN HATE<|>Biden's administration is addressing the issue of anti-Asian hate in the wake of the Atlanta shootings<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
