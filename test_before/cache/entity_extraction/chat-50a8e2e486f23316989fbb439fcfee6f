The first thing she asked was if Zheng was Chinese. Zheng said yes. The woman walked out of the restaurant without saying anything.\nLi said his mother brushed off the incident; to her, it was nothing new.\n\"As an immigrant, we have all faced racism in America,\" Li said. \"I think my first reaction was, 'Wow, I can't believe that happened.' But when you think about it, racism still exists in America. I just hope (my mom) doesn't get attacked physically.\n\"Fears fuel anger, and sometimes it can really hurt people.\"\nTo keep track of incidents in Iowa, the Asian alliance has created an online form where community members can submit reports of harassment and discrimination.\n\"We must take collective action to prevent and stop these hateful acts. We want to know if our AAPI Iowans are experiencing biased incidents or actions against them due to Coronavirus/COVID-19,\" the organization wrote in a statement.\nPost-quarantine fears\nHuynh said that discrimination against Asian and Pacific Islander communities is nothing new.\n\"I think the reality is, these are individuals who have always harbored those feelings. COVID-19 has given them a reason to actually verbalize it, and take action,\" she said. \"It gives them reason to strike, and in their eyes, it's justifiable.\"\nPham agreed: \"Racist ideology and racist rhetoric wasn't created by coronavirus; it's already been there. It's been there for a long time.\"\n\"We're not just thinking about anti-Asian sentiment, we're thinking about black and brown folks, too,\" Pham said.\nBoth Monsoon API and IAA have been creating virtual spaces for the community to continue to support one another.\n\"We talk about things like how we can still be open, how we can still be providing for API, low income, refugee, immigrant communities,\" Pham said. \"I hope that all of this allows us to have more conversations and think deeper about the history of racism in this country.\"\nAndrea Sahouri covers breaking news for the Des Moines Register.
