The returning audience, she said, was supportive and shocked.\nAl Gregory and other CSE staff regrouped over the following days and researched a more rigorous process to weed out intruders on future webinars. For future events, those wishing to attend must have a password, RSVP, and then be placed on a waiting list as CSE staff verify their identifies and intentions. While Gregory said this system should prevent what happened to Chong from happening again, they acknowledge these added steps come at a cost.\n\"We don't like having those barriers with people and spaces that are intended to be safe and to help foster connection,\" Gregory said.\nImmediately following the pesto pasta lesson, CSE asked if Chong would teach another class in the Front Porch series. She didn't hesitate in her response.\n\"I'm not one to allow stuff like this to stop me,\" said Chong, who had detailed her \"Zoombombing\" experience on Instagram. \"If they asked me to do more, I'll continue doing more.\"\nOn the afternoon of April 10, Chong guided a virtual audience of 12 through a Shrimp pasta recipe with a Caesar salad side. Gregory and their fellow CSE staff watched for any unapproved accounts but none appeared. Chong said it was a perfect way to end the week.\nBrian Gordon is the education and social issues reporter for the Asheville Citizen Times.
