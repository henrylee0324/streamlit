What is China's comment?\nZhao Lijiang: The report once again vindicates the fact that tracing the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue,\nand it is up to scientists around the world to conduct international scientific research and cooperation. WHO officials have\nsaid virus tracing is an ongoing process that may involve multiple countries and localities. As this process proceeds, we\nshould be open to the many possibilities for where the virus may come from.\nChina continues supporting scientists around the world in conducting global scientific research on the source and route\nof transmission of the virus. We also support WHO-led cooperation among member states on the zoonotic source of\nCOVID-19 and in other fields.\nGlobal Times: Several media outlets have reported that a number of Chinese students in Australia were recently\nsubjected to racial discrimination and even violent attacks. On July 4, a Chinese student at the University of South\nAustralia was seriously injured in an abuse and attack near Adelaide's Chinatown by three local men. What is China's\ncomment?\nZhao Lijian: Recently there has been rising discrimination against overseas Chinese, including Chinese students, and\neven Asians in Australia. Some of them suffered violent attacks, and their physical and mental health and even lives\nwere seriously threatened. In response to these circumstances, the Chinese government issued a travel advisory and\nan alert for Chinese students going to study in Australia. This is a truly responsible practice.\nWe once again remind students who plan to study or are studying in Australia to conduct a risk assessment and be\ncautious when making the choice to go or return to Australia, and remind the overseas Chinese in Australia to\nstrengthen safety precautions. We once again urge the Australian side to face up to the problem and take concrete\nmeasures to protect the safety, rights and interests of Chinese citizens in Australia.\nXinhua News Agency: The website of the US Department of Defense released Secretary Mark Esper's message on the\naccomplishments in the implementation of the National Defense Strategy on July 7. He said that \"China and Russia\nconstitute our top strategic competitors\", and that \"we established a China Strategy Management Group and I directed\nthe National Defense University to refocus its curriculum by dedicating 50 percent of the coursework to the PRC.\" Do\nyou have any comment?\nZhao Lijian: This US official's remarks and the 2018 National Defense Strategy he mentioned are fundamentally flawed\nand run counter to the trend of the times as they preach nothing but obsolete concepts of a Cold-War mentality, a\nzero-sum game mindset, and hyped-up strategic competition between major countries.\nChina's policy towards the US is consistent and clear. We are committed to working with the US side for non-conflict,\nnon-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. At the same time, we are firmly committed to\nsafeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests. China urges the US to discard its Cold-War\nmentality and ideological bias, view the world and China-US relations in the 21st century in a correct way, and work\nwith China to move forward the bilateral relations along the track of coordination, cooperation and stability.\nChina Daily: It is reported that Côte d'Ivoire's Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly passed away on July 8.

The two militaries are set to hold extensive talks on bringing back peace\nand tranquility in the region. Can you confirm that and give us some updates on the disengagement? Will there be\nmore bilateral talks between Chinese and Indian troops?\nZhao Lijian: Following the consensus reached at the commander-level talks, the Chinese and India border troops have\nbeen taking effective measures to disengage at Galwan Valley and other areas in the western sector. The overall\nsituation at the China-India boundary is stable and ameliorating. The two sides will continue to maintain dialogue and\ncommunication through military and diplomatic channels, including holding a new round of commander-level talks and\nthe meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs. We hope India\nwill work with China towards the same goal to implement consensus reached between the two sides with concrete\nactions and jointly de-escalate tensions in the border region.\nBBC: Earlier you mentioned that Australia was in breach of basic norms governing international relations with its\ncomments and moves regarding Hong Kong. Can you tell us which laws they are?\nZhao Lijian: Isn't \"non-interference in other countries' internal affairs\" a basic norm governing international\nrelations?
