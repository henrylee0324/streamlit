Citing concerns with the alarming levels of spread and severity, the WHO called for governments to take urgent and aggressive action to stop the spread of the virus.\nInternational human rights law guarantees everyone the right to the highest attainable standard of health and obligates governments to take steps to prevent threats to public health and to provide medical care to those who need it. Human rights law also recognizes that in the context of serious public health threats and public emergencies threatening the life of the nation, restrictions on some rights can be justified when they have a legal basis, are strictly necessary, based on scientific evidence and neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application, of limited duration, respectful of human dignity, subject to review, and proportionate to achieve the objective.\nThe scale and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic clearly rises to the level of a public health threat that could justify restrictions on certain rights, such as those that result from the imposition of quarantine or isolation limiting freedom of movement. At the same time, careful attention to human rights such as non-discrimination and human rights principles such as transparency and respect for human dignity can foster an effective response amidst the turmoil and disruption that inevitably results in times of crisis and limit the harms that can come from the imposition of overly broad measures that do not meet the above criteria.\nThis document provides an overview of human rights concerns posed by the coronavirus outbreak, drawing on examples of government responses to date, and recommends ways governments and other actors can respect human rights in their response.\nContents\nCOVID-19\nApplicable International Standards\nHuman Rights Concerns\nProtect freedom of expression and ensure access to critical information Ensure quarantines, lockdowns, and travel bans comply with rights norms Protect people in custody and in institutions\nEnsure protection of health workers\nFulfill the right to education-even if schools are temporarily closed Address disproportionate impacts on women and girls\nRoot out discrimination and stigma, protect patient confidentiality\nEnsure marginalized populations can access health care without discrimination Protect community and civil society organizations\nPromote the rights to water and sanitation\nEnsure humanitarian aid continues\nTarget economic relief to assist low-wage workers\nWhat is Human Rights Watch doing?\nCOVID-19\nCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus first identified in December 2019. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses known to cause respiratory infections. There is no vaccine yet to prevent COVID-19, and no specific treatment for it, other than managing the symptoms.\nBy mid-March 2020, more than 150 countries had reported cases of COVID-19, and the WHO reported there were more than 200,000 cases worldwide. More than 7,000 people had died and the numbers were continuing to rise at an alarming rate.\nApplicable International Standards\nUnder the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which most countries have adopted, everyone has the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Governments are obligated to take effective steps for the prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases.\nThe United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which monitors state compliance with the covenant, has stated that:\nThe right to health is closely related to and dependent upon the realization of other human rights, as contained in the International Bill of Rights, including the rights to food, housing, work, education, human dignity, life, non-discrimination, equality, the prohibition against torture, privacy, access to information, and the freedoms of association, assembly and movement. These and other rights and freedoms address integral components of the right to health.\nThe right to health provides that health facilities, goods, and services should be:\navailable in sufficient quantity,\naccessible to everyone without discrimination, and affordable for all, even marginalized groups; acceptable, meaning respectful of medical ethics and culturally appropriate; and\nscientifically and medically appropriate and of good quality. The Siracusa Principles, adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in 1984, and UN Human Rights Committee general comments on states of emergency and freedom of movement provide authoritative guidance on government responses that restrict human rights for reasons of public health or national emergency. Any measures taken to protect the population that limit people's rights and freedoms must be lawful, necessary, and proportionate. States of emergency need to be limited in duration and any curtailment of rights needs to take into consideration the disproportionate impact on specific populations or marginalized groups.\nOn March 16, 2020, a group of UN human rights experts said that emergency declarations based on the COVID-19 outbreak should not be used as a basis to target particular groups, minorities, or individuals. It should not function as a cover for repressive action under the guise of protecting health... and should not be used simply to quash dissent.\nThe Siracusa Principles specically state that restrictions should, at a minimum, be: provided for and carried out in accordance with the law;\ndirected toward a legitimate objective of general interest;\nstrictly necessary in a democratic society to achieve the objective;\nthe least intrusive and restrictive available to reach the objective;\nbased on scientic evidence and neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application; and\nof limited duration, respectful of human dignity, and subject to review. Human Rights Concerns Protect freedom of expression and ensure access to critical information\nUnder international human rights law, governments have an obligation to protect the right to freedom of expression, including the right to seek, receive, and impart information of all kinds, regardless of frontiers. Permissible restrictions on freedom of expression for reasons of public health, noted above, may not put in jeopardy the right itself.\nGovernments are responsible for providing information necessary for the protection and promotion of rights, including the right to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health, which declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus first identified in December 2019, which has led to a global pandemic affecting over 150 countries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is a city in China where the COVID-19 virus was first identified in December 2019.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is the country where the COVID-19 outbreak was first reported, specifically in the city of Wuhan.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1945, which aims to promote international cooperation and maintain international order, including in matters of public health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Human Rights Watch is an international non-governmental organization that conducts research and advocacy on human rights, including issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>COVID-19<|>The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, highlighting its significance in public health.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WUHAN<|>COVID-19<|>COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, making it a critical location in the context of the pandemic.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>WUHAN<|>Wuhan is a city in China, where the COVID-19 outbreak originated.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>Human Rights Watch discusses the implications of the WHO's declarations and guidelines in relation to human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations, working on global health issues including pandemics.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>COVID-19<|>The United Nations addresses global health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, through its various agencies and initiatives.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
