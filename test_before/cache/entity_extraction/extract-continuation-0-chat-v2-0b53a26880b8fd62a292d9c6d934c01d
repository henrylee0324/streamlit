It felt so\nstrange. Our roles had flipped.\nMy plea mirrored the admonitions I received from them as a child growing up in Houston. The world, they cautioned, was hostile and it viewed us as strangers. So they warned\nme to stick close to my family. Close to my kind.\nThe fact that the coronavirus seems to have originated in China has spawned a slew of anti-Asian hate crimes. Across the country, Asian American parents and children are\nmaking versions of the call I made. Friends are sharing first-hand accounts of abuse on text chains and circulating articles on Facebook, always ending with the suddenly\nominous \"stay safe.\"\nGrowing up, the assumption was that once we became American enough, there would be no need for such warnings -- that we would be safe. To that end, my parents\nencouraged me and my younger brother to watch as much television as possible, so that we might learn to speak and act like the natives. The hope was that race would not\ndisadvantage us -- the next generation -- if we played our cards right.\nWhen I became an actor (maybe as a result of all that TV), and really started to work, I felt glimmers of my parents' hope coming to fruition -- doors were open, strangers were\nkinder. In some ways, I began to lead a life devoid of race. But I've learned that a moment always comes along to remind you that your race defines you above all else.\nIt might be a small moment, like a salesperson greeting you with \"konnichiwa.\" Or it might be a string of moments, like the press tour that Kal Penn and I took to promote\n\"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\" in 2004, a few years after 9/11.\nWe flew across the country -- New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle -- and it became a grim routine: Flight after flight, Kal would be pulled aside for a \"random\" search. On one\nleg of the tour, Kal's friend Gabe joined us, and when we hit security, Kal was selected for a search while Gabe and I flew through unscathed. We gathered our bags and waited\non a bench for Kal to be released. Rummaging through his backpack, Gabe suddenly said, \"Kal's going to be annoyed.\" When I looked inside it, I realized why: Gabe, who is\nwhite, had gone camping recently, and had neglected to remove his Rambo-sized hunting knife from his backpack.\nI gasped and looked back at Kal, who was watching a Transportation Security Administration worker empty the contents of his bag. It was a reality check.\nAsian Americans are experiencing such a moment right now. The pandemic is reminding us that our belonging is conditional. One moment we are Americans, the next we are all\nforeigners, who \"brought\" the virus here.\nLike fame, the \"model minority\" myth can provide the illusion of \"raceless-ness.\" Putting select Asians on a pedestal silences those who question systemic injustice. Our\nsupposed success is used as proof that the system works -- and if it doesn't work for you, it must be your fault.\nNever mind that 12% of us are living below the poverty line. The model minority myth helps maintain a status quo that works against people of all colors.\nBut perhaps the most insidious effect of this myth is that it silences us. It seduces Asian Americans and recruits us to act on its behalf. It converts our parents, who in turn,\nencourage us to accept it. It makes you feel protected, that you're passing as one of the good ones.\nAnd because the stereotypes may be complimentary (hardworking, good at math), it makes people -- including us -- think that anti-Asian sentiment is somehow less serious,\nthat it's racism lite. That allows us to dismiss the current wave of Asian hate crimes as trivial, isolated and unimportant. Consider the comedians who mock Asians, but restrain\nthemselves when it comes to other groups.\nOf course, with the falsely positive come the negative stereotypes (you're sneaky, you're stealing jobs, you're corrupt). After I had been busted for cheating on a Latin quiz in\nhigh school, I recall my teacher asking, \"Why are Koreans such cheaters?\"\nDuring times of national stress, it's these darker stereotypes that prevail. My wife's families were incarcerated in camps during World War II, even while her great-uncles were\nserving in an all-Japanese American battalion of the U.S. Army. Vincent Chin, a Chinese American autoworker, was brutally beaten to death in Detroit in 1982, blamed for the\nJapanese \"takeover\" of the auto industry. And just recently, an Asian woman in Brooklyn had acid thrown at her while she was taking out the trash, another among the\nskyrocketing attacks against Asians.\nI came to this country in 1978, at the age of 6. I was naturalized on Nov. 21, 1990, during the military buildup before the start of the Gulf War. I remember being surprised by\nthe judge at the ceremony asking me whether I would defend my country in uniform if called upon. I wasn't expecting that question, though my friends and I had been\nwondering about a possible draft, and I took my time to truly consider it. I answered yes and I meant it.\nI claimed the citizenship my parents wanted for me and I think I've spent my life earning it. I'm not going to let anyone tell me or anyone who looks like me that we are not\nreally American.\nIf the coronavirus has taught us\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOUSTON<|>GEO<|>Houston is a city in Texas where the author grew up and received warnings from their parents about safety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAL PENN<|>PERSON<|>Kal Penn is an actor who participated in a press tour for the film \"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\" in 2004.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GABE<|>PERSON<|>Gabe is a friend of Kal Penn who joined him and the author on a press tour and inadvertently brought a hunting knife to the airport.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAROLD & KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE<|>EVENT<|>A film released in 2004 that Kal Penn and the author promoted during a press tour.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>PERSON<|>Vincent Chin was a Chinese American autoworker who was brutally beaten to death in Detroit in 1982.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and has affected the perception of Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. ARMY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The U.S. Army is the military service of the United States, in which the author's wife's great-uncles served during World War II.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are individuals of Asian descent living in the United States, who are currently facing increased hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOUSTON<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The author's experiences growing up in Houston reflect the broader challenges faced by Asian Americans in society.<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAL PENN<|>HAROLD & KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE<|>Kal Penn starred in the film \"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle,\" which he promoted during a press tour.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GABE<|>KAL PENN<|>Gabe is a friend of Kal Penn who traveled with him and the author during the press tour for the film.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Vincent Chin's murder is a significant event in the history of anti-Asian sentiment in America, impacting Asian Americans today.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, affecting the Asian American community significantly.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>U.S. ARMY<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>Vincent Chin's death highlighted the racial tensions during a time when Asian Americans were serving in the U.S. Army.<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
