A couple standing about 20 to 30 feet away from him stared in alarm. The woman turned and ran away. Another time, he was walking down an Oakland street with a group of people when someone started coughing. It wasn’t Chan, but people turned around, glared at him and covered their mouth. The dirty looks happened weeks ago, before California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the state's 40 million residents to stay at home. Before President Donald Trump referred to the deadly COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus.\" Before the coronavirus pandemic sent the country’s economy into a tailspin. And before it killed hundreds of Americans and infected thousands more. “They look at me and think I’m some kind of virus,” said Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. Anti-Asian American sentiment: Asian American lawmakers sound the alarm on coronavirus-related discrimination. Across the U.S., Asian Americans have become the target of xenophobic and bigoted attacks as the pandemic wreaks havoc in American society. Experts said the scapegoating is fueled by harmful rhetoric from politicians, including the president, who later called for the protection of Asian Americans from xenophobic attacks after repeatedly calling COVID-19 the \"Chinese virus.\" In recent months, people of Asian descent – not just Chinese Americans – have been shunned, verbally abused, name-called, coughed and spat on, even physically assaulted, said Russell Jeung, chair of the Asian American Studies Department at San Francisco State University who’s been studying bias-related incidents against Asian Americans during the coronavirus epidemic. The scapegoating is reminiscent of old racist tropes that led to discriminatory policies against Asian immigrants in the United States – from the quarantining of San Francisco’s Chinatown during the bubonic plague of the 1900s, to the rounding up of Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II, experts and advocates said. Wearing face masks, a practice that began in Asian countries for cultural and environmental reasons and has crossed over to immigrant communities in the United States, has now become a racialized symbol of the virus. “If you’re wearing a mask, you’re seen as a disease carrier. If you’re not wearing a mask, you’re seen as a disease carrier but negligent,” Jeung said. In New York City, the Commission on Human Rights, which investigates incidents of harassment, discrimination and bias, has received a “sharp increase” in calls about COVID-19 related discrimination that includes incidents of bias against Asian Americans, spokeswoman Alicia McCauley said. McCauley said she’s unable to give an exact number, but the agency is receiving calls daily. The New York Police Department is investigating an attack against a woman who was yelled at and assaulted at a subway station. A viral video shows the woman, who appeared to be of Asian descent and was wearing a mask, running as a man chased and struck her.

The department’s Hate Crimes Task Force tweeted Monday that it was aware of reports of “several COVID-19 related hate crimes” and “arrests have been made in most cases.” NYPD’s spokesman did not respond to questions, including how many reports and arrests have been made, or if the victims were of Asian descent. The state’s attorney general, Letitia James, also recently launched a hotline for New Yorkers to report hate crimes related to coronavirus. “No one should live in fear for their lie because of who they are, what they look like, or where they come from,” James said in a statement Monday. In Bellevue, Washington, police chief Steve Mylett said he’s seen a 178% increase in the number of applications for firearm transfers. The state requires firearm dealerships to report all firearm transfers to local police. Mylett said a significant number of applicants appeared to have last names consistent with Chinese heritage. Harassment and other bias-related incidents have “put enough fear into them that they felt like they needed to arm themselves to protect themselves and their families,” Mylett said. But despite the abundance of anecdotal evidence reported in the media and by advocacy groups, many police departments, including Mylett’s, said they have not seen any significant uptick in the number of hate-crime reports related to COVID-19. This suggests that people may be hesitant, if not fearful, to go to police. The rhetoric: Trump uses China as a foil when talking coronavirus, distancing himself from criticism. That’s a concern for Mylett. Hate crimes normally start as aggressive comments that don’t rise to the level of a crime before they escalate into physical violence, he said. “So the earlier law enforcement can intervene, then hopefully we’ll be able to prevent somebody (from) being victimized and somebody making a decision that will land them in jail for a long time,” Mylett said. Jeung, the San Francisco State professor, said there are several reasons why people may not want to report to police. Many Asian Americans are culturally reticent to deal with the government, he said. Some fled authoritarian regimes from their home countries and are inherently distrustful of authority. Some also came to the United States illegally and are fearful of calling attention to themselves. Language barriers can also be an issue. Jeung and two advocacy groups in California recently launched a website allowing people to report incidents anonymously. They have received 673 responses over the past week from across the country, many of which came from New York and California, where majority of the United States’ Asian populations live, according to their report. The incidents involved not only Chinese Americans, but also Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese, Vietnamese and Filipinos – a clear case of racial profiling against Asian Americans, Jeung said. Some said they were barred from business\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CARL CHAN<|>PERSON<|>Carl Chan is the president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce and has experienced discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAVIN NEWSOM<|>PERSON<|>Gavin Newsom is the Governor of California who ordered residents to stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States who referred to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus\" and has been criticized for his rhetoric.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>PERSON<|>Russell Jeung is the chair of the Asian American Studies Department at San Francisco State University and has studied bias-related incidents against Asian Americans during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California where incidents of discrimination against Asian Americans have been reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where Carl Chan experienced discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City has seen a sharp increase in calls about COVID-19 related discrimination against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLEVUE<|>GEO<|>Bellevue is a city in Washington where police reported a significant increase in firearm transfer applications among individuals with Chinese heritage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a state in the U.S. where many incidents of discrimination against Asian Americans have occurred during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread discrimination against Asian Americans and has significantly impacted society and the economy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian American Studies Department at San Francisco State University studies bias-related incidents against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York Police Department investigates incidents of harassment, discrimination, and bias, including hate crimes related to COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETITIA JAMES<|>PERSON<|>Letitia James is the New York Attorney General who launched a hotline for reporting hate crimes related to coronavirus.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARL CHAN<|>OAKLAND<|>Carl Chan experienced discrimination while in Oakland, highlighting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAVIN NEWSOM<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Gavin Newsom's stay-at-home order affected all residents of California during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric during the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to discrimination against Asian Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES DEPARTMENT<|>Russell Jeung is the chair of the Asian American Studies Department, which studies incidents of discrimination<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>San Francisco has been a location where discrimination against Asian Americans has been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>New York City has seen a rise in discrimination against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLEVUE<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Bellevue has reported an increase in firearm transfer applications among individuals of Chinese heritage during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETITIA JAMES<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>Letitia James launched a hotline in collaboration with the New York Police Department to report hate crimes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>Russell Jeung's research on bias-related incidents has been significant in understanding discrimination in New York City<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
