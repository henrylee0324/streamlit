In\nGeorgia the next day, lunch was sandwiches handed off between latex-covered fingers at a Starbucks\ndrive-through.\nBy dusk on the 18th, they were on their balcony rocking chairs in Sarasota, watching the sky turn a\nbruised pink over the Gulf of Mexico. McNally's health had worsened, as he had grown weaker and\nshort of breath. But he preferred sipping seltzer with his husband than more time in a hospital.\nOn the evening of March 20, McNally said, for the first time in their relationship: \"I want to talk about\ndying.\"\nWhat followed was a long conversation, ranging from nuts-and-bolts estate planning to spiritual\nmatters.\n\"We talked about family and friends and art and nature and gratitude,\" Kirdahy said. \"A lot about\ngratitude.\"\nAt 9:21 the next morning, Kirdahy called 911 to report that his husband was coughing up blood.\n***\nFive days before Kirdahy's 911 call, Cookie Dungill called Sevil from his Chicago hospital room with a\nsudden concern.\nCookie couldn't remember if he had paid his bills that month. He asked his son to head over to his\nhouse and make sure he was up to date on his gas and lights.\nSevil had for the last week been suffering an odyssey of severe symptoms from his own bout of\nCOVID-19. He isolated on the first floor of his home, wearing a mask and leaving the second floor to\nhis teenage son and wife, who brought him trays of food and stayed six feet away.\nHe had pneumonia, diarrhea and such severe night sweats that he had to get up in the middle of the\nnight to change his soaked shirt.\nBut because he didn't want his dad to worry about his own poor health, he agreed to check on his\nbills. He dragged himself out to his car, made it to his father's house and slumped in front of the\ncomputer with Cookie on the phone.\nIt took them 21/2 hours to puzzle through usernames and passwords to ascertain that Cookie had in\nfact paid his bills before he was hospitalized. They wheezed with laughter at their own ineptitude.\n\"Dad, don't worry,\" Sevil said. \"We're going to make it.\"\nCookie called again a few days later, but this time his son couldn't pick up. He was on the other line\nwith an official from the CDC, who was pumping him with detailed questions about his movements\nand interactions in the previous two weeks.\nThe official wanted to know everything about the pizza dinner Sevil shared with his friend. He wanted\nto know who was in what rooms of the church the next day, who shook hands and hugged, and who\nate from the buffet.\nThe health agency was following a cluster of Chicago cases that hinged on a single event: Angeli's\nJoyous Celebration. The CDC was in the midst of declaring it one of the country's earliest and most\nsevere coronavirus spreading events, likely infecting at least 16 people.\nAnd at its center was a single individual, Sevil's friend, whom the CDC believed had brought the virus from Arizona. The friend had gone to a birthday party a few days after the funeral and apparently\nspread the virus to family members, according to the CDC. The virus then spread further when\nthose family members went to sermon at a packed church, complete with a collection plate as a\npossible vector.\nEven without the call from the health official, Sevil's vicinity to the epicenter of the spread of the\nvirus in Chicago was already clear to him.\nOn March 16, his friend's sister died. A warm, boisterous woman known for singing in church, she\nwas the first official novel coronavirus death in Illinois. His friend lost another sister to the virus\nless than two weeks later.\nWhen Sevil got off the phone with the contact tracer, he went to call Cookie back at the hospital.\nBut his father was by then unconscious, having been put on a ventilator.\nSevil later learned from his sister Gina the words that were among his last.\nCookie had called her to say the hospital staff was urging him to go on the ventilator not because\nhe needed it yet, but because he was experiencing labored breathing and the staff didn't want to\nhave run out of them when he did need one.\nIt was a reasoning common earlier in the pandemic that medical experts now regret, following\nstudies showing that ventilators were overused and might have contributed to a higher death rate.\nGina encouraged him to follow the doctors' recommendations, optimistic that it would help him\nrecover. Though he agreed, she later said she could hear the fear in his voice.\n\"I don't want to die,\" he told her.\n***\nUSA TODAY shared with Ranney, the emergency physician and Brown University professor, the\nstories of both the Dungills in Chicago and the ailing playwright McNally's sojourn to Florida.\nRanney said that the thread that ran through both of their cases was that they had been failed by\nthe government.
