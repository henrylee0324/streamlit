A dirty, muted silver, with a box of repair tools in the\nback seat, it was an American kind of eyesore that screamed of rugged determination. My great-uncle, who left\nZhejiang, China, to be with us in Houston, drove it proudly until January 2007, when he was shot and killed by\nmen in ski masks while out on a walk with my great-aunt.\nUntil the surge in attacks on Asian Americans recently made the national spotlight, I had tried to forget. After\nall, my family toiled for more than a decade to bury the trauma, and to an extent it worked. My younger sister\ndid not know the whole truth until I told her prior to the publication of this column.\nThis past year, as anti-Asian hate crimes significantly increased, Asian Americans had known what was coming.\nWhen then-President Donald Trump called covid-19 the \"China virus,\" we saw a warning where others saw a\nmisnomer. We urgently shared reports of violent incidents through native language apps, including WeChat and\nKakaoTalk, and Facebook groups such as Subtle Asian Traits. Last March, reminiscent of \"the talk\" that Black\nparents often give their children about facing law enforcement, my mother warned me not to wear a mask until\nit became common practice, fearing it would make me a target.\nIn April, a Brooklyn woman suffered severe burns after being doused with chemicals. Last month, 84-year-old Thai immigrant Vicha Ratanapakdee died in an assault in San Francisco. Noel Quintana, a 61-year-old Filipino\nman riding the New York subway this month, required about 100 stitches after being slashed with a box cutter.\nStop AAPI Hate, a coalition documenting anti-Asian hate amid covid-19, has tracked more than 2,800 incidents\nof violence, harassment or discrimination between March and December 2020, many aimed at the elderly.\nActivists say the true numbers are surely higher.\nBut beneath calls for advocacy and safety, some conversations circulating within Asian American communities\nare troubling. Across online platforms, video footage showing Black men as the perpetrators in some attacks has\nspawned greater anti-Black sentiment even as nationwide protests in defense of Black lives continue. A Subtle\nAsian Traits post detailing the attacks prompted comments accusing Black Lives Matter supporters of\nindifference. On Reddit and Twitter, users have repopularized a 2010 article calling \"black-on-Asian violence\" San\nFrancisco's \"dirty secret.\"\nI urge my fellow Asian Americans to reject these narratives. We cannot answer racism with racism.\nWe should know as well as anyone where such arguments from anecdote can lead. The better impulse is to\nexamine how the potential for conflict was historically built into our communities. Political scientist Claire Jean\nKim has described Asian American identity as partly formed by a \"racial triangulation\" process beginning in the\nmid-19th century, when Chinese workers began immigrating en masse to California. The economic boom there\ncreated demand for cheap labor, and White political and business elites valorized Asian immigrants over Blacks.\nAsians fulfilled an economic need while simultaneously being disadvantaged as aliens removed from the claims\nto American-ness increasingly being asserted by Black leaders.\nAs Kim argues, this formula continues to generate conflict today. It can be seen, for instance, in the affirmative\naction debate whenever Asian Americans are weaponized as a perceived success story against Black Americans'\ncritiques of structural discrimination.\nBut racial conflict between Asian and Black Americans is certainly not inevitable. Organizations such as the Dear\nAsians Initiative have translated letters about Black Lives Matter into 12 languages to challenge anti- Blackness\nand promote dialogue within our communities. In Oakland, Calif., hundreds of Black and Asian community\nmembers recently rallied in solidarity. Sociologist Jennifer Lee, in her book \"Civility in the City,\" shows that\ndespite flash points such as the Los Angeles riots of 1992, the city's Korean and Black communities have\ntypically worked to make civility more common than conflict. As Asian Americans, we can protect ourselves and\nseek accountability without becoming conduits for racism.\nAfter my great-uncle's death, we promptly sold the Jeep. We later left Texas for a wealthier Asian enclave east\nof Los Angeles. We never found out who killed him.\nThe pain endures, but I wonder now if knowing would have eased it or risked contorting our grief into hatred. To\ntry to make sense of the senseless is human, but whoever the perpetrators were - and whatever race they were\n- they represented no one but themselves. And so we must be careful in our heartbreak. Inequality in America\nis a disease with many expressions. Only by rooting out our shared suffering can we protect the beautiful,\nmanifold lives of our loved ones.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ZHEJIANG<|>GEO<|>Zhejiang is a province in China from which the great-uncle of the narrator emigrated to the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSTON<|>GEO<|>Houston is a city in Texas where the narrator's family resides.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT-UNCLE<|>PERSON<|>The great-uncle of the narrator was a resident of Houston who was tragically shot and killed in January 2007.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT-AUNT<|>PERSON<|>The great-aunt of the narrator was with the great-uncle during the incident that led to his death.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump was the President of the United States who referred to COVID-19 as the \"China virus,\" which contributed to anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a coalition that documents incidents of anti-Asian hate amid the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBTLE ASIAN TRAITS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Subtle Asian Traits is a Facebook group that discusses issues affecting Asian Americans and has been a platform for sharing experiences related to anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old Thai immigrant who died in an assault in San Francisco.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOEL QUINTANA<|>PERSON<|>Noel Quintana is a 61-year-old Filipino man who was attacked on the New York subway and required extensive medical treatment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLAIRE JEAN KIM<|>PERSON<|>Claire Jean Kim is a political scientist who has written about the racial triangulation process affecting Asian American identity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENNIFER LEE<|>PERSON<|>Jennifer Lee is a sociologist who authored \"Civility in the City,\" discussing community relations between Asian and Black communities in Los Angeles.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where Black and Asian community members rallied in solidarity.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT-UNCLE<|>GREAT-AUNT<|>The great-uncle and great-aunt were together during the tragic incident that led to the great-uncle's death<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT-UNCLE<|>HOUSTON<|>The great-uncle lived in Houston with his family<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric contributed to the rise in anti-Asian hate incidents documented by Stop AAPI Hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>SUBTLE ASIAN TRAITS<|>Both organizations are involved in addressing and documenting anti-Asian hate incidents<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>HOUSTON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee's death in San Francisco is part of the broader context of anti-Asian violence affecting communities, including those in Houston<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOEL QUINTANA<|>HOUSTON<|>Noel Quintana's attack in New York is part of the broader context of anti-Asian violence affecting communities, including those in Houston<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLAIRE JEAN KIM<|>HOUSTON<|>Claire Jean Kim's work on racial triangulation is relevant to understanding the dynamics of race and identity in communities like Houston<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JENNIFER LEE<|>OAKLAND<|>Jennifer Lee's research on community relations is relevant to the solidarity rallies that occurred in Oakland<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
