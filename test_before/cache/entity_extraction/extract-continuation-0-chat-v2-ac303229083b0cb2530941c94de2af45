The first showed a rider yelling at the Asian man and repeatedly ordering him to move. When people on the train asked the man why he was asking the stranger to get out of his way, the man shouted, \"Because he's standing right f---ing next to me!\"\nThe upset man then grabs a spray can and starts spraying it at the Asian man, who remained standing near the door of the subway car. The second video showed the Asian man confronting the other man, asking: \"Why is that? Why can't I sit next to you?\"\nThe New York Police Department confirmed to the New York Post on Thursday that the Hate Crimes Task Force was investigating. A representative said that someone called 911 to report the incident but that by the time officers arrived at the station the train had already departed, so no report was taken.\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority retweeted the video on Thursday and described it as racist.\n\"What works in stopping the spread of Coronavirus: 1.
