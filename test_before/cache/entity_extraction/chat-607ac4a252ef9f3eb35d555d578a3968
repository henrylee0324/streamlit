That stereotype then shifted to Aotearoa's Pacific communities in mid-2020.\n\"In general, however, because Pacific peoples have closer cultural connections to Maori, and geographic\nconnections to nearby Pacific nations, they tend not to be cast as foreign threats in the same way as Asians.\n\"Research I've been involved in shows that Pacific peoples are subjected to racism that many Maori\nunderstand - being unfairly suspected as criminogenic, lazy in school and work.\n\"In contrast, Asians get cast as the distant foreign threats who will take over the economy, housing market\nand schools if not kept in check.\"\nHe believes it's important for New Zealand to recognise Maori as tangata whenua, and also that anyone who\nis not Maori, including Pakeha, comes from a migrant background.\n'All they see us as are sports stars and entertainers'\nThe University of Auckland's Dr Sereana Naepi says it was \"very telling\" how quickly and easily the rumours\ntargeting Auckland's Pasifika communities over the August Covid-19 cluster were believed.\nOne rumour suggested that a woman from a Pasifika family contracted the virus by sneaking into a managed\nisolation facility to see a man.\nThis fed into the \"dusky maiden\" trope stemming from colonial times, which sexualised and objectified Pacific\nwomen.\n\"People latched on to this fake story of criminals and sex,\" Naepi says.\nNew Zealand's colonising of the Pacific cemented the colonisers' views of Pacific communities as children to\nbe taken care of, instead of strong, independent nations capable of caring for themselves.\nColonisers took on an almost paternal role so that Pacific communities were incapable of being seen as a\nforeign threat, she adds.\n\"People are happy to have Pacific communities when they benefit from their labour and cultural capital, but\nthey're less likely to invest in these communities.\n\"All they see us as are sports stars and entertainers - in their minds, we have a specific space to fill in New\nZealand society.\"\nAnd when this wasn't filled? Pacific communities were labelled as people who did not contribute, as\nunderachievers and criminals, she says.\nGatekeeping who gets to be kept in and out\nGrace Gassin, a researcher and curator of Asian New Zealand histories at Te Papa Tongarewa, says \"for a\nlot of New Zealand's history, there's been a desire to keep New Zealand white for lack of a better way to\nput it\".\n\"I guess we're all dealing with the legacies of anti-Chinese discrimination and, broadly, discrimination\nagainst non- whites which happened legislatively, administratively and socially.\"\nAsian migrants had been around during seminal events and there were also instances of solidarity between\nMaori and Asian communities - moments often not heard about when New Zealand history is told.\nShe mentions Minnie Rose Alloo, a woman of Chinese and Scottish ancestry, as an example of this. Her\nsignature sits neatly on a suffrage petition in 1893. She was 19 at the time of signing, making her too\nyoung to do so.\nGassin says the way some New Zealand history was written makes it seem as if Pakeha were \"colonial\nmediators\".\nAs the dominant group, they had a central position, which meant they could determine the relationship\nbetween other ethnic groups, she says.\n\"Pakeha are colonisers here on this land, so it's interesting. You could argue that they're the ultimate\nforeigner and migrant in the context of New Zealand history.\n\"But it's often that dominant group who gets to decide who are the foreigners, and gatekeep who gets to\nbe kept in and out. They're the ones that get to form a nation's identity.\"\nAfter the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, people could enter the country, but those who were not British\nwere considered aliens.\nBut throughout history, there have been barriers to prevent people - particularly those of colour - from\ncoming to New Zealand.\nIn 1881, immigration restrictions were placed on Chinese people, who had to pay a poll tax to enter.\nAfter World War I, German people, Marxists and socialists were restricted from entering New Zealand.\nThe 1920 Immigration Restriction Amendment Act, better known as the \"White New Zealand Policy\",\nmade it difficult for anyone not British to come to New Zealand till the 1970s. Permission had to be\ngiven by the minister of customs.\nChinese migrants were recruited by the Dunedin Chamber of Commerce to work in the Otago goldfields.\nThe first 12 men arrived from Australia in 1868 and, by late 1869, more than 2000 Chinese men had\ncome to the goldfields.\nPacific peoples had four waves of migration, dating from 800 to 1000 years ago. The first wave was the\ncoming of the Maori. The second and third waves were tied to European colonisation of the Pacific, with\npeople coming to Aotearoa as trainee teachers, missionaries, sailors, whalers and civil servants.\nThe fourth wave was linked to migration for economic reasons, with Pacific peoples finding work in the\nmanufacturing and service sectors after World War II.\nAfrican Americans arrived in colonial times, but most of the arrivals from Britain's African colonies in the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
