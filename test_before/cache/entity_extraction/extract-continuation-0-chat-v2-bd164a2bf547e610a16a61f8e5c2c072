attacks since the beginning of April to the country's leading survey of anti-China racism.\nThe figures prompted calls for the federal government to track racism better as federal MPs accused the Chinese government of spreading divisive propaganda when on Saturday it encouraged its citizens to avoid travelling to Australia due to a \"significant increase\" in racial discrimination amid coronavirus.\nOsmond Chiu, a fellow at independent progressive think tank Per Capita, authored the survey in collaboration with the Asian Australian Alliance and Being Asian Australian. \"There definitely has been an increase,\" he said, noting that compared to similar data from the United States there has been a higher proportion of racist incidents against Asian- Australians than Asian-Americans.\nThe survey, which started on April 2 and will be completed this month, has so far documented 386 racist incidents, including abuse, physical intimidation and spitting.\nThe survey also revealed that roughly 90 per cent of racist incidents were not being reported to police and the vast majority were perpetrated by strangers in public.\nMr Chiu called on the federal government to improve what he said was a disjointed incident reporting process, potentially through the Human Rights Commission.\nLabor's multicultural affairs spokesman Andrew Giles backed the call as a way to help develop a strong anti-racism strategy.\n\"We've got to do a better job at tracking racism,\" Mr Giles said.\n\"There's clearly confusion as to how people can report racist incidents and we feel there's a role for national government to do considerably more.\"\nLiberal senator Andrew Bragg said the federal government had run an anti-racism campaign during the pandemic, encouraging Australians to report incidents to the Human Rights Commission. \"There's not much more we can do other than call it out from the Prime Minister, call it out from senior ministers and run a supportive campaign directly to people,\" he said. \"I'm very pleased with the response.\"\nLiberal senator James Paterson said China's comments were a diversion from its own conduct.\n\"Australians rightly deplore racism. Knowing this, the Chinese Communist Party uses accusations of racism in an attempt to divide us and deflect criticism of their own conduct,\" he said.\nMr Chiu accused the Chinese government of politicising racism, but noted there was a middle ground between calling out the Chinese Communist Party and recognising anti-Chinese racism was growing.\n\"If you look at it globally, you've seen an increase in COVID-related racism across the world,\" he said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN-AUSTRALIANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian-Australians are individuals of Asian descent living in Australia who have reported incidents of racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSMOND CHIU<|>PERSON<|>Osmond Chiu is a fellow at the independent progressive think tank Per Capita and authored a survey on anti-China racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PER CAPITA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Per Capita is an independent progressive think tank that collaborated on a survey regarding racism against Asian-Australians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AUSTRALIAN ALLIANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian Australian Alliance is an organization that collaborated on the survey about racism against Asian-Australians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEING ASIAN AUSTRALIAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Being Asian Australian is an organization that worked with Per Capita and the Asian Australian Alliance on the racism survey.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Human Rights Commission is a federal body that could potentially improve the reporting process for racist incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDREW GILES<|>PERSON<|>Andrew Giles is the Labor's multicultural affairs spokesman who supports better tracking of racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDREW BRAGG<|>PERSON<|>Andrew Bragg is a Liberal senator who commented on the federal government's anti-racism campaign during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMES PATERSON<|>PERSON<|>James Paterson is a Liberal senator who criticized the Chinese Communist Party's comments regarding racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE GOVERNMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese government is the ruling authority of China, which has been accused of spreading divisive propaganda related to racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese Communist Party is the ruling political party in China, criticized for its comments on racism and its conduct.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RACISM SURVEY<|>EVENT<|>The racism survey is an initiative started on April 2 to document incidents of racism against Asian-Australians.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSMOND CHIU<|>PER CAPITA<|>Osmond Chiu authored the survey in collaboration with Per Capita<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSMOND CHIU<|>ASIAN AUSTRALIAN ALLIANCE<|>Osmond Chiu collaborated with the Asian Australian Alliance on the racism survey<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSMOND CHIU<|>BEING ASIAN AUSTRALIAN<|>Osmond Chiu worked with Being Asian Australian on the racism survey<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PER CAPITA<|>HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION<|>Per Capita suggested improvements to the reporting process potentially through the Human Rights Commission<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDREW GILES<|>HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION<|>Andrew Giles backed the call for the Human Rights Commission to help develop an anti-racism strategy<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDREW BRAGG<|>HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION<|>Andrew Bragg mentioned the Human Rights Commission in the context of an anti-racism campaign<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMES PATERSON<|>CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY<|>James Paterson criticized the Chinese Communist Party for its comments on racism<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE GOVERNMENT<|>ASIAN-AUSTRALIANS<|>The Chinese government has been accused of spreading propaganda that affects Asian-Australians<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RACISM SURVEY<|>ASIAN-AUSTRALIANS<|>The racism survey documents incidents reported by Asian-Australians<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
