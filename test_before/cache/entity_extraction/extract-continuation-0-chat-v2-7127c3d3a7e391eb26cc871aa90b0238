Over the last three months, though, she has been getting up at 3 am every night. \"I check my sleep tracking app once a week and it shows that I am only getting four hours of sleep every day.\nTypically, when you wake up in the night, you go back to sleep. These days the mind is never at rest so that is not happening anymore,\" says Malaviya, filing it under latent Covid-19 stress.\nThe lack of sleep has emerged as a major casualty in the wake of the global pandemic and the subsequent lockdown it has brought about in many countries, say insomnia therapists around the world. People across age groups are worried about catching Covid or passing it on to their family. They are concerned about job security. In many cases, the lockdown restrictions leave them with nothing time-bound to wake up to either. All these have led to \"almost everyone\" seeking therapy complaining of lack of sleep or a ruptured sleep cycle, say the therapists. And at least one-third of these are facing this issue for the first time.\nRavi Kant, a 27-year-old student from IIM-Shillong, started having sleepless nights after the lockdown forced him to return to his hometown, Patna, thereby disrupting his college routine. Though the classes shifted online, worries about an uncertain future keep him wide awake till the wee hours of the morning. He now uses the time between midnight and 6 am to focus on studying instead.\n76663983\"If users express anxiety over tracking their sleep, we advise them to scrap the trackers and concentrate on how they feel in the morning. That is the best sleep quality score you will ever get\" Carl Johan Hederoth, CEO, Sleep Cycle\n\"Family has also accepted this as my new normal.\" As people are getting sleepless in Seattle, Shoreditch and Shillong, some are reaching out to tech for help. The downloads of sleep tracking app Sleep Monitor were up by 1.5X between April and May, and by 2X from May to June so far, at over a million Android installs. \"We saw a lot of users from the US and European countries (mainly from France, Italy, the UK, German, Turkey, Poland) from March to May,\" says a company spokesperson via email. \"In May and June, we saw users increasingly downloading the app from Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt. All those were organic users.\"\n76663832\"People of colour are likely to have more sleep-related anxieties during these times. They prefer going to practitioners of colour but there aren't a lot of insomnia experts of colour in the country\" Joshua Tal, sleep and health psychologist, New York\nMedication for sleep is the most preferred route in the US, say the therapists. In India, however, people prefer trying yoga, exercises, sleep-centric music and podcasts.\nSleep featured in the top 10 moods for users in India every week on Spotify since mid-April. Over the last three months, India was also among the top 10 streaming markets for popular sleep podcasts on the music-streaming app, according to data shared by the company's PR team.\nOver 40% of the people approaching MindPeers, a mental health tech platform, suffer from sleep-related issues, says founder Kanika Agarwal who shuttles between Delhi and Singapore. \"Some people who reached out hadn't slept in 3-4 days,\" she says. The platform is active in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru at present. Ishita Pateria, a counselling psychologist based in Mumbai, says she has seen a 70% spike in mild to major cases of insomnia among her clients in the past two months.\nSleepless in the city\n3X More sleep-related enquiries to therapists after Covid-19 outbreak20-30% Of sleep-related enquiries are from those experiencing insomnia for the first time2X Increase in May-June downloads of tracking app Sleep Monitor; it was 1.5X in April-May33% Hike in sleep music usage on meditation app Headspace since Mid-March, against past 30 daysSleep featured in Top 10 moods on Spotify for Indian users every week since mid-AprilJust why are so many people around the world having sleepless nights these days? Lindsay Browning, a sleep expert from London, explains it with an analogy: \"If you see a lion coming to attack you, you will not be able to fall asleep, will you? Your body senses it to be a life-threatening danger and reacts accordingly. Heart rate goes up, so does your breathing rate, and there is a sudden rush of adrenaline.\nIt prompts the person to run in the opposite direction.\" Covid-19 is what many see as a similar danger coming at them. \"But this time you can't physically run away.\" So, the body responds to stress by staying awake.\n76663842\"Short-term sleep problems aren't going to kill anybody. Else, every new set of parents would be dead. Our bodies will be able to recover from this\" Lindsay Browning, sleep expert, London\nThe lockdown-led challenges don't help. The human body has a circadian rhythm that takes cues from the sun to follow a routine which keeps them awake during the day and asleep at night. \"A lot of people, say, in countries like Italy and cities like New York, live in flats that don't get enough sunshine to get these cues. While working from home,\npeople are also eating meals at erratic hours, which further confuses the body and messes up the circadian rhythm,\" she adds. 76663953Sonali\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SONALI MALAVIYA<|>PERSON<|>Sonali Malaviya is a tech marketing professional based in Gurgaon, who has been experiencing sleep issues exacerbated by latent Covid-19 stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GURGAON<|>GEO<|>Gurgaon is a city in India where Sonali Malaviya resides.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has led to increased stress and sleep issues among individuals worldwide.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAVI KANT<|>PERSON<|>Ravi Kant is a 27-year-old student from IIM-Shillong who has been experiencing sleepless nights due to the lockdown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IIM-SHILLONG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IIM-Shillong is an educational institution where Ravi Kant was studying before the lockdown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATNA<|>GEO<|>Patna is the hometown of Ravi Kant, where he returned due to the lockdown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLEEP MONITOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sleep Monitor is a sleep tracking app that saw a significant increase in downloads during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINDPEERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MindPeers is a mental health tech platform that helps individuals suffering from sleep-related issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KANIKA AGARWAL<|>PERSON<|>Kanika Agarwal is the founder of MindPeers, who reports a high percentage of users suffering from sleep-related issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISHITA PATERIA<|>PERSON<|>Ishita Pateria is a counselling psychologist based in Mumbai who has seen a spike in insomnia cases among her clients.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELHI<|>GEO<|>Delhi is a city in India where MindPeers operates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUMBAI<|>GEO<|>Mumbai is another city in India where MindPeers operates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENGALURU<|>GEO<|>Bengaluru is also a city in India where MindPeers operates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEADSPACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Headspace is a meditation app that has seen an increase in sleep music usage since the pandemic began.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONDON<|>GEO<|>London is a city where sleep expert Lindsay Browning is based.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINDSAY BROWNING<|>PERSON<|>Lindsay Browning is a sleep expert from London who provides insights on sleep issues related to stress and the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLEEP CYCLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sleep Cycle is a company that offers sleep tracking solutions and is mentioned in relation to user anxiety over sleep tracking.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SONALI MALAVIYA<|>COVID-19<|>Sonali Malaviya's sleep issues are attributed to stress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAVI KANT<|>COVID-19<|>Ravi Kant's sleepless nights began after the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KANIKA AGARWAL<|>MINDPEERS<|>Kanika Agarwal is the founder of MindPeers, which addresses sleep-related issues among users.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISHITA PATERIA<|>MINDPEERS<|>Ishita Pateria is a psychologist who has seen an increase in insomnia cases among clients using MindPeers.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SONALI MALAVIYA<|>SLEEP MONITOR<|>Sonali Malaviya's sleep issues may lead her to consider using sleep tracking apps like Sleep Monitor.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAVI KANT<|>IIM-SHILLONG<|>Ravi Kant is a student at IIM-Shillong, which is where he was studying before the lockdown disrupted his routine.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MINDPEERS<|>SLEEP MONITOR<|>MindPeers and Sleep Monitor both address sleep-related issues, with MindPeers providing therapy and Sleep Monitor offering tracking solutions.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEADSPACE<|>COVID-19<|>Headspace has seen an increase in sleep music usage due to the stress and sleep issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINDSAY BROWNING<|>COVID-19<|>Lindsay Browning explains how the stress from Covid-19 affects sleep patterns.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
