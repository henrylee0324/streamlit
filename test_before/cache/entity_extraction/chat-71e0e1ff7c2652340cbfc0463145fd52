The victim\nwas rushed to a hospital but eventually died on January 30th. The assailant was later arrested by San Francisco\npolice and has now been charged with murder.\nThe victim's family and the broader Thai community in the US believe, however, that this was a hate crime, fueled\nby racial discrimination against Asian Americans. Donations poured in to raise funds for the funeral of the victim.\nAfter the fatal incident, a campaign was launched on social media in Thailand, calling for equal justice, human\nrights protection and declaring opposition to racial hatred and discrimination.\nAccording to a report from the Centre to End Racial Violence against Asian-Americans, violence against Asian and\nPolynesian Americans across the US has increased by about 40% since the outbreak of COVID-19. - Thai PBS\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
