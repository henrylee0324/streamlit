Two more Asian Americans, a 60-year-old\nman and a 55-year-old woman, were also attacked that same day - Jan 31 - and had to be taken to hospital,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nA 28-year-old African American has been arrested. He is a suspect in all three cases.\nThe incidents came just days after Mr Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai man, died after he was similarly\nattacked while out on a morning walk in his San Francisco neighbourhood on Jan 28.\nA 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and elder abuse in that case.\nAt a press conference last Monday in Oakland's Chinatown, Alameda County district attorney Nancy O'Malley,\nannouncing the task force, said: \"The rapid increase in criminal acts targeted against members of the Asian\ncommunity, particularly Chinese Americans, who live and work in Alameda County is intolerable.\"\nLast week, the Committee of 100, an influential non-partisan group of prominent Chinese Americans in\nbusiness, government, academia and the arts, released a White Paper commissioned by the Economist\nIntelligence Unit on the contributions of Chinese Americans to the United States.\nThe release was in response to increased anti-China sentiment in \"an age inflamed with resurgent racism, and\nwith geopolitical tension reversing decades of fruitful exchange with China\".\n\"The US has reached a moment when it is critical to examine how diversity has benefited the society and how\nminority groups such as Chinese Americans have, over time, become identified with the country itself,\" the\nreport says.\nChinese Americans contributed more than US$300 billion ($373 billion) to US gross domestic product in 2019\nthrough consumer spending, supporting three million jobs, the report says.\nUNACCEPTABLE ACTS\n“The rapid increase in criminal acts targeted against members of the Asian community, particularly Chinese\nAmericans, who live and work in Alameda County is intolerable.”\nALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY, announcing the task force.\n\"There are over 160,000 Chinese American-owned businesses in the US, generating approximately US$240\nbillion in revenue and supporting 1.3 million jobs as of 2017,\" it adds.\nLast August , the United Nations special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination,\nxenophobia and related intolerance, in a note on the US, wrote: \"Racially motivated violence and other incidents\nagainst Asian Americans have reached an alarming level across the US since the outbreak of Covid-19.\"\nIt added: \"Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans, including those of Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese,\nFilipino, and Burmese descent, among others, have been subject to racist, xenophobic attacks.\"\nIt said the attacks included being spat on, blocked from public transport and beaten.\nThe Jan 6 storming of the US Capitol demonstrated the danger of anti-Chinese sentiment amplified to deafening\nlevels by right-wing media.\nTake, for example, Larry R. Brock, a retired US Air Force lieutenant-colonel photographed carrying zip-tie\nhandcuffs on the Senate floor during the insurrection by hundreds of Trump supporters.\nA week before, he wrote on Facebook that he saw no distinction among the Democrats, the Biden administration\nand \"an invading force of Chinese communists\".\nOn Jan 27, President Joe Biden signed an executive action directing federal agencies to combat xenophobia.\n\"Today, I'm directing federal agencies to combat the resurgence of xenophobia, particularly against Asian\nAmericans and Pacific Islanders, that we've seen skyrocket during this pandemic. This is unacceptable and it's\nun-American,\" the President said.\nThe Committee of 100 welcomed the statement, but feels more is needed, hence the White Paper.\nCommittee of 100 president Zhengyu Huang, who is based in San Francisco, told The Sunday Times: \"Last year,\nwe saw almost 3,000 documented cases of anti-Chinese and anti-Asian incidents.\n\"We knew we had to speak up forcefully, because racism and discrimination are unfortunate, negative aspects of\nsociety.\n\"Despite 175 years of contribution, we still suffer from the perpetual foreigner stereotype, and that\nstereotype has been exacerbated by two seismic trends - increasing tension and competition between the US\nand China, and Covid-19.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
