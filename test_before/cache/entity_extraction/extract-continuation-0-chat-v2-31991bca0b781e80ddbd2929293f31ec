Do you have any comment? Second, Global Times cited sources that China is considering\nsuing the German scholar Adrian Zenz and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Can you confirm this? Third question,\nin his speech on Sunday, Pope Francis didn't talk about his concerns over freedom and human rights in Hong Kong which\nhe planned to speak of. Some say Pope Francis may have been under China's pressure. Has China asked the Vatican not\nto talk about Hong Kong?\nZhao Lijian: On your first question, the Australian side's comments and measures are in serious violation of international\nlaw and the basic norms governing international relations. They constitute gross interference in China's internal affairs,\nand China doesn't accept it. We express strong condemnation and reserve the right to make further reaction, and\nAustralia should bear all the consequences.\nThe Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR is an important step to ensure the steady and\nsustained implementation of the \"one country, two systems\" principle. Its implementation will strengthen Hong Kong's\nlegal framework, ensure social order, improve business environment, and contribute to Hong Kong's prosperity and\nstability. The attempt to pressure China will never succeed.\nChina urges Australia to immediately change course, stop intervening in Hong Kong affairs and China's domestic affairs,\nand prevent further harm to China-Australia relations.\nOn your second question, I noticed the report and Adrian Zenz's argument. Why is he so anxious to speak if he's done\nnothing to be guilty of? It's common sense that all deliberate slanders should be condemned and held accountable.\nAs is widely known, Adrian Zenz and the ASPI have been smearing China by fabricating lies. Their rumors on China have\nalready been proven false by facts like a slap in the face. So if the report you mentioned is true, I'm not even surprised.\nIt's not the first time that Chinese and foreign media reveal those behind Zenz and the ASPI. I'll not repeat it here. Here's\na piece of advice: come back to the right course as soon as possible, because too many vile deeds will inevitably lead to\none's self-destruction.\nOn your third question, I am not aware of the situation, but we hope and believe that people of vision who truly care\nabout Hong Kong will choose to act in ways beneficial to Hong Kong's development. China will continue to engage in\nconstructive dialogues with the Vatican and work for the improvement of bilateral relations.\nShenzhen TV: The Daily Telegraph reported an Oxford University expert's opinion that as is proved by more and more\nevidence, the coronavirus may have lain dormant across the world and emerged when the environmental conditions were\nright for it to thrive rather than starting in China. What is China's comment?\nZhao Lijiang: The report once again vindicates the fact that tracing the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue,\nand it is up to scientists around the world to conduct international scientific research and cooperation. WHO officials have\nsaid virus tracing is an ongoing process that may involve multiple countries and localities. As this process proceeds, we\nshould be open to the many possibilities for where the virus may come from.\nChina continues supporting scientists around the world in conducting global scientific research on the source and route\nof transmission of the virus. We also support WHO-led cooperation among member states on the zoonotic source of\nCOVID-19 and in other fields.\nGlobal Times: Several media outlets have reported that a number of Chinese students in Australia were recently\nsubjected to racial discrimination and even violent attacks. On July 4, a Chinese student at the University of South\nAustralia was seriously injured in an abuse and attack near Adelaide's Chinatown by three local men. What is China's\ncomment?\nZhao Lijian: Recently there has been rising discrimination against overseas Chinese, including Chinese students, and\neven Asians in Australia. Some of them suffered violent attacks, and their physical and mental health and even lives\nwere seriously threatened. In response to these circumstances, the Chinese government issued a travel advisory and\nan alert for Chinese students going to study in Australia. This is a truly responsible practice.\nWe once again remind students who plan to study or are studying in Australia to conduct a risk assessment and be\ncautious when making the choice to go or return to Australia, and remind the overseas Chinese in Australia to\nstrengthen safety precautions. We once again urge the Australian side to face up to the problem and take concrete\nmeasures to protect the safety, rights and interests of Chinese citizens in Australia.\nXinhua News Agency: The website of the US Department of Defense released Secretary Mark Esper's message on the\naccomplishments in the implementation of the National Defense Strategy on July 7. He said that \"China and Russia\nconstitute our top strategic competitors\", and that \"we established a China Strategy Management Group and I directed\nthe National Defense University to refocus its curriculum by dedicating 50 percent of the coursework to the PRC.\" Do\nyou have any comment?\nZhao Lijian: This US official's remarks and the 2018 National Defense Strategy he mentioned are fundamentally flawed\nand run counter to the trend of the times as they preach nothing but obsolete concepts of a Cold-War mentality, a\nzero-sum game mindset, and hyped-up strategic competition between major countries.\nChina's policy towards the US is consistent and clear. We are committed to working with the US side for non-conflict,\nnon-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. At the same time, we are firmly committed to\nsafeguarding China's sovereignty, security\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER<|>PERSON<|>The Australian Prime Minister announced the suspension of the extradition agreement with Hong Kong and the extension of visas for Hong Kong residents in Australia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONG KONG<|>GEO<|>Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China, which is currently under scrutiny due to national security laws.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country that has implemented a national security law affecting Hong Kong and is involved in international relations regarding this issue.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADRIAN ZENZ<|>PERSON<|>Adrian Zenz is a German scholar cited by Global Times, known for his critical views on China's policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Australian Strategic Policy Institute is an independent think tank that has been accused by China of fabricating lies about its policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POPE FRANCIS<|>PERSON<|>Pope Francis is the head of the Catholic Church who was expected to address concerns over freedom and human rights in Hong Kong.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VATICAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Vatican is the ecclesiastical state led by Pope Francis, involved in diplomatic relations with China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has raised questions about its origins and transmission.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of South Australia is an educational institution where a Chinese student was attacked.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADELAIDE<|>GEO<|>Adelaide is a city in Australia where incidents of racial discrimination against Chinese students have occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XINHUA NEWS AGENCY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Xinhua News Agency is a state-run press agency in China that reports on national and international news.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The US Department of Defense is the federal department responsible for coordinating and supervising all agencies and functions of the government related directly to national security and the armed forces.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER<|>HONG KONG<|>The Australian Prime Minister's decision to suspend the extradition agreement directly affects Hong Kong's legal status<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER<|>CHINA<|>The Australian Prime Minister's actions are a response to China's national security law affecting Hong Kong<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADRIAN ZENZ<|>AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE<|>Adrian Zenz is associated with the ASPI, which has been criticized by China for its reports<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POPE FRANCIS<|>VATICAN<|>Pope Francis represents the Vatican, which is involved in diplomatic discussions with China<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>VATICAN<|>China and the Vatican are engaged in constructive dialogues regarding Hong Kong<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHO<|>COVID-19<|>The WHO is involved in global efforts to trace the origins and manage the response to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA<|>ADELAIDE<|>The University of South Australia is located in Adelaide, where incidents of violence against Chinese students occurred<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XINHUA NEWS AGENCY<|>CHINA<|>Xinhua News Agency reports on issues related to China's national policies and international relations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE<|>CHINA<|>The US Department of Defense's comments about China reflect the strategic competition between the two nations<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
