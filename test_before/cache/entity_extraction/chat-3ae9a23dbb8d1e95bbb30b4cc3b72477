Cisneros added that anti-Chinese rhetoric, in particular, dates back to the 19th century, and has continued even as recently as the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the swine flu outbreak of 2009.\nLehigh University researchers found, for example, that media coverage of the SARS outbreak propagated negative images of Asians, which in turn led to \"detrimental\" emotional effects.\n\"Rather than focusing on relief efforts by the government and actions taken to contain the epidemic, mainstream media chose to simply expose and repeatedly accuse the Asian population of initiating the spread of SARS,\" the researchers found.\nDuring the swine flue outbreak, fearmongering against people of Mexican descent was rampant, according to Cisneros. In 2009, NBC News reported on a number of talk show hosts saying xenophobic and racist things about Mexicans and people of Mexican descent.\nStanford University Graduate School of Business professor Hayagreeva Rao and former student Sunasir Dutta led a study on the relationship between infectious diseases and views on immigration. The study had 2 groups: one wasn't primed, while another was primed, to read about the new strains of flu. Those who were primed to think about the flu were less likely to support immigration.\n\"What our study shows very clearly is that exposure to discourse about contagious disease activates xenophobic tendencies in people,\" Rao said in an article on the university's blog.\n\"Somebody's contaminating the water supply, somebody's contaminating the food — these kinds of rumors are very common,\" Dutta said. \"And sometimes, they lead to violence.\"\nDespite the increase in racist and xenophobic microaggressions and attacks in early 2020, James Heimowitz, president of the China Institute, a nonprofit in New York City, told Business Insider that he feels those acts are not representative of what most people feel.\n\"While racism certainly exists in America, my overall impression and observation is that the majority of people are coming together and trying to collaborate during this global health crisis,\" he said.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
