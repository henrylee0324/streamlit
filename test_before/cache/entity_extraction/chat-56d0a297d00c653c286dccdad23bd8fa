But with COVID-19, that hasn’t been the case,\nhe said.\nThe study narrows this down to two possible explanations: workers are voluntarily leaving their jobs, or they’re\nleaving due to discrimination.\n“Compared to other racial groups, Asian Americans are more keenly aware of the danger of this virus. It first\naffected people in China, then spread to Korea. So Asian Americans know the danger because they hear from\nrelatives in these countries. Maybe there’s additional concern in their community,” Kim said in the release.\nAlso uncovered in the study is that the discrimination Asian Americans potentially face in the work environment\ndue to the pandemic is layered: COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, and President Donald Trump still\nregularly uses racist phrases such as “the China Virus” or “Kung Flu” to describe the deadly respiratory disease.\nAnd while these are the prevailing discrimination factors, underlying them is the level of education a worker has\nreceived.\n“For the well-educated workers, they are relatively more secure,” Kim said. “But for the less-educated workers,\nit’s actually easier to discriminate. If you look at what happened to African Americans before the pandemic,\nusually less-educated workers are more discriminated against in the market.”\nThe article mentions that the lower level of education that workers have, the more likely it is that their job\ninvolves some form of manual labor or physical interaction with people that workers with higher education may\nbe in a position to shield themselves from.\n“This creates a hostile environment. The FBI has reported that hate crimes against Asian Americans have\nincreased dramatically because of this,” Kim said.\nIn the news release, Kim predicted that if a COVID-19 vaccine were made available soon and the economy could\npull itself out of a recession, job numbers for Asian Americans would return to what they were pre-pandemic.\nThe article has been published virtually in a journal called Research in Social Stratification and Mobility.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
