Their focus pulls inward, drawing a circle around their families and loved ones. The hardships of others tend to recede to the periphery. But this narrowed view can get ugly when the focus shifts to laying blame; too often, people who are \"othered\" bear the brunt.\nMay is Asian heritage month and, in an unpleasant irony, anti-Asian hate crimes and online rhetoric are on the rise. The confluence of these opposing events inspired Vancouver dancer and choreographer Ziyian Kwan to organize a peaceful dance action earlier this week. She chose a space outside the Chinese Cultural Centre, which in April was vandalized with racist graffiti.\nKwan told CBC's Early Edition she was verbally accosted while visiting the site. \"Take your bike back where you came from,\" a stranger shouted. \"You people made this up in Wuhan City and now you've brought it here to Canada.\"\nThere's a lot to unpack in this brief, angry tirade: the myth (dispelled by scientists) the virus was manufactured in a lab; the conflation of Chinese government actions with Asian heritage; the hideous notion of ethnicity as a disease vector. But there can be little confusion how and where the seeds of these falsehoods were planted, and how widely they're taking root.\nChina's government is under legitimate and mounting scrutiny for its early handling of the virus, including from Canada's ambassador to Beijing. But the country has become the favoured scapegoat for politicians looking to distract from their own critical failures, and fire up a nationalistic voting base.\nThe administration of U.S.\nPresident Donald Trump is pushing an attack narrative against the findings of its own intelligence community. The words of the Vancouver assailant, which so shook Kwan, might as well have been crafted in the U.S. Oval Office, where on May 6 the U.S. president told reporters: \"It could have been stopped in China. It should have been stopped at the source, and it wasn't.\"\nNot one to miss an opportunity for hyperbole, he further asserted: \"This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center. There's never been an attack like this.\"\nA Republican election strategy based on attacking China is spelled out in a 57-page memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which was leaked to Politico, a U.S. political journal. Several candidates are going all-in.\nOne poisonous election ad for Florida Congressional candidate Casey Askar states: \"China unleashed the Wuhan pandemic on the world, costing trillions, costing jobs, costing American lives.\"\nAnother, for Texas candidate Kathaleen Walsh, depicts the \"Chinese virus\" sailing toward the U.S. \"China is a criminal enterprise masquerading as a sovereign nation,\" the ad alleges. \"It's time to fight back.\"\nIt's important to ask what this strategy achieves, and at what cost. Racist messaging has proved an effective way to fire up Trump's base. And red herrings about the Wuhan lab also are fuel for conspiracy theorists, whose dependable circulation of misinformation plays an essential role in undermining democracy.\nWe've even seen this tactic floated in Canadian politics. In April, rookie MP and Conservative leadership candidate Derek Sloan turned on Canada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, asking: \"Does she work for Canada or for China?\" Tam responded, with dignity, she would not be distracted by \"noise.\"\nUnfortunately, the noise is taking a toll. A poll conducted the same week in Canada's largest cities, by the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice, found roughly one in seven respondents either thought all Chinese or Asian people carried COVID-19, or they weren't sure.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ZIYIAN KWAN<|>PERSON<|>Ziyian Kwan is a Vancouver dancer and choreographer who organized a peaceful dance action in response to rising anti-Asian hate crimes during Asian heritage month.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE CULTURAL CENTRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese Cultural Centre in Vancouver was vandalized with racist graffiti in April, highlighting issues of anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is the country that has been scrutinized for its handling of the virus and has become a scapegoat for various political narratives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANADA<|>GEO<|>Canada is the country where the events of rising anti-Asian hate crimes and the peaceful dance action took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is involved in the political narrative surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and has seen a rise in anti-China sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former U.S. President who has been pushing an attack narrative against China regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Republican Senatorial Committee is a political organization that has developed strategies to attack China in the context of the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASEY ASKAR<|>PERSON<|>Casey Askar is a Florida Congressional candidate who has used anti-China rhetoric in his election campaign.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATHALEEN WALSH<|>PERSON<|>Kathaleen Walsh is a Texas Congressional candidate who has also employed anti-China messaging in her campaign.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEREK SLOAN<|>PERSON<|>Derek Sloan is a rookie MP and Conservative leadership candidate in Canada who questioned the loyalty of Canada's chief public health officer regarding China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THERESA TAM<|>PERSON<|>Theresa Tam is Canada's chief public health officer who responded to accusations regarding her loyalty to Canada versus China.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZIYIAN KWAN<|>CHINESE CULTURAL CENTRE<|>Ziyian Kwan organized a dance action outside the Chinese Cultural Centre, which was vandalized, highlighting the impact of anti-Asian hate crimes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>UNITED STATES<|>China is the focal point of the U.S. political narrative regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, with rising anti-China sentiment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>UNITED STATES<|>Donald Trump, as the U.S. President, has been a key figure in promoting anti-China rhetoric during the pandemic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE<|>UNITED STATES<|>The National Republican Senatorial Committee has developed strategies that target China in the context of the pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CASEY ASKAR<|>NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE<|>Casey Askar's campaign is aligned with the strategies outlined by the National Republican Senatorial Committee against China<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATHALEEN WALSH<|>NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE<|>Kathaleen Walsh's campaign also reflects the anti-China strategies promoted by the National Republican Senatorial Committee<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEREK SLOAN<|>THERESA TAM<|>Derek Sloan publicly questioned Theresa Tam's loyalty, reflecting the political tensions regarding China in Canada<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THERESA TAM<|>CANADA<|>Theresa Tam represents Canada's public health response amidst rising anti-Asian sentiment and political scrutiny<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
