He later died.Another video shows a 91-year-old man in Oakland's Chinatown neighborhood being pushed facedown into the sidewalk cement from behind in an apparently unprovoked attack.The attacks quickly reinvigorated simmering outrage, fear and hurt over a wave of anti-Asian violence and harassment that community leaders say was spurred earlier in the pandemic by the rhetoric of former President Donald J. Trump, who insisted on calling the coronavirus \"the China virus\" or the \"Kung Flu.\"California's Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus issued a statement condemning \"a surge in hate crimes targeting innocent Asian and Pacific Islander Americans,\" describing it as \"a national emergency.\"But while researchers have said that inflammatory statements from leaders can exacerbate racist behavior, experts say it is difficult to quantify hate.Incidents of racism can take many forms -- like being coughed on or spat upon, or being denied a rideshare. Tallying such incidents requires that victims tell the authorities or another organization what happened, which can be difficult when they may feel ashamed or distrustful of those authorities.One statistic that has been widely cited, identifying a 1,900 percent increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans, appears to come from the New York Police Department, which said that in 2019, only one anti-Asian incident was reported, compared with 20 in the first half of 2020, according to The Queens Chronicle.Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative formed last March aimed at tracking and responding to incidents of violence and discrimination against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, received more than 2,800 reports of racism and discrimination targeting Asian-Americans between March 19 and Dec. 31.Of those, a vast majority, about 71 percent, were incidents of verbal harassment. Physical assaults made up 8.7 percent.Russell Jeung, the chair of the Asian-American Studies Department at San Francisco State University and one of the leaders of Stop AAPI Hate, said that, according to the organization's data, people 60 and older were disproportionately targeted with physical violence, as were women.Dr. Jeung said that it was not clear whether the recent attacks in the Bay Area were racially motivated, but that it was likely that older people walking alone through their neighborhoods to shop may appear vulnerable. And particularly around holidays, they may be carrying cash.\"We tend to see small upticks in crime during the Lunar New Year because people are out shopping,\" Dr. Jeung said.In another widely reported incident this month, a 64-year-old woman of Vietnamese descent had just left a bank with more than $1,000 in cash for the holiday when her purse was snatched.What is clear, Dr. Jeung said, is that Asian-American communities are in pain. And even with new recognition from President Biden -- who last month signed a memorandum directing federal agencies to explore ways of combating racism and xenophobia against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States -- there is more work to be done.\"The community is alarmed and upset and we demand justice,\" Dr. Jeung said.San Francisco is not the only area of the country seeing a rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans. New York City saw a large surge in hate crimes directed at Asians in 2020 and most of the increase was directly related to the pandemic, the police said.There were at least 28 hate crimes against Asians reported to the New York police, and all but four involved an assumption that the victim had the coronavirus, the police said. The crimes included assault, vandalism, theft and harassment.In August, the steep rise in bias crimes against Asian people prompted the New York Police Department to form a special task force to investigate them. \"It was a huge uptick, so much so that people were starting to talk about it, and we needed to address the situation,\" said Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, the task force's director.But in 2021, some community organizers and advocacy groups, including Stop AAPI Hate, have said Asian-Americans must look beyond calling for increased police presence in neighborhoods to achieve that justice.\"We recognize that policing has led to the criminalization of communities of color, and mass incarceration,\" Dr. Jeung said. \"Why perpetuate a system that doesn't work?\"The people arrested in both the Chinatown incident in Oakland and the fatal assault on Mr. Ratanapakdee are Black, which community organizers said has brought to the fore some anti-Black racism, particularly as outrage about the attacks has spread on social media.Lai Wa Wu, policy and alliance director for the San Francisco-based Chinese Progressive Association, said that while the influence of the former president was a new factor, the tensions among communities of color were not new, and neither were the systemic inequities that perpetuate them.There are no shortcuts to deep, sustainable healing, Ms. Wu said. Progress requires investing in neighborhoods; increasing access to education, housing and food; and having \"difficult, honest conversations.\"Nevertheless, she said, \"It's been really heartening in some sense, to see the level of solidarity and the amount of support, not only from our own communities in the city and across the Bay, but from Black and brown communities.\"Younger activists have harnessed social media to raise awareness and circulate calls to action, including fund-raising drives and volunteer initiatives.Eda Yu, 25, a writer and journalist who is half Chinese and half Indonesian, and her partner, Myles Thompson, a Black designer, saw news of the attacks\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old man who was violently attacked in San Francisco and later died from his injuries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California where a series of anti-Asian violence incidents have occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where another incident of anti-Asian violence took place in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an initiative formed to track and respond to incidents of violence and discrimination against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The California Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus is a group that condemned the surge in hate crimes against Asian and Pacific Islander Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD J.
