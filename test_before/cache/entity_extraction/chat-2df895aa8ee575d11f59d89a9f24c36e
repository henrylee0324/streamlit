This includes through its misleading self-\nportrayal in Discover Canada, the official study guide for the test taken by Canadian citizenship applicants.\nIssued in 2011, the guide aims to teach prospective citizens about Canada's history, geography, culture, and\npolitical and justice systems. Disgracefully, the document whitewashes colonialism, conceals genocide,\nminimizes systemic racism and its inhumane consequences, and portrays these as remnants of the past even as\nthe guide itself engages in racist discourse.\nWe write as female faculty members at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto. Our\nperspective on these issues is borne of our shared concerns yet differing relationships to \"Canadian\" nationality.\nOne of us is Algonquin (Timiskaming First Nation), another is a woman of African ancestry, born in Canada, surviving transatlantic enslavement, two are new-ish Canadians (white European heritage, from the United\nStates and South Africa), another is a permanent resident from the U.S. (from Venezuela).\nRecognizing Discover Canada's flaws, the government set out in 2016 to remove certain offensive elements,\nincluding the portrayal of immigrants'\"barbaric cultural practices\" and the glorification of military exploits.\nA draft shared with The Canadian Press in 2017 incorporated coverage of the Truth and Reconciliation\nCommission's 2015 report, as well as discussion of discrimination against people of racialized backgrounds,\npeople with disabilities, LGBTQ2S+ people and other marginalized communities.\nDespite an expected 2017 release - during Canada's sesquicentennial - the new version, inexplicably, never\ncame to light. Outrageously, Discover Canada is still the welcome guide for new Canadians. Just a few of its\nshameful elements include: 1. It presents a sanitized account of Indigenous peoples, before and under\ncolonization. This erases the history and legacy of stolen lands and dispossession, the upheaval of nations,\ncultural genocide, broken treaties, assimilation policies such as residential schools, police and carceral racism,\ncontinued heinous living conditions on reserves and hugely inequitable health outcomes.\nFrom the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which states Indigenous people are sovereign, to the British North\nAmerica Act of 1867, there is no discussion of how the Doctrine of Discovery shaped the nation. Discover\nCanada also omits Indigenous people's resistance movements, past and present, that contest historical and\nongoing forms of colonialism and oppression. 2. The guide celebrates Upper Canada as \"the first province in the\nEmpire to move toward abolition\" and as a \"safe haven\" for enslaved Black people escaping the United States.\nBut there is no mention of Canada's own history of slavery, nor of the pervasive racist violence and human\nrights violations faced by African and Black Canadians. The guide's omission of the Code Noir (1685, revised in\n1789) further erases the reality of policed and enslaved African lives, which included forced religious conversion,\nsanctioned punishment and other brutalities.\nThis legacy, combined with successor policies, has generated overrepresentation of Black and Indigenous\nchildren in foster care and Children's Aid facilities and high rates of educational, food and housing insecurity, all\ngenerating worse health outcomes among Black Canadians.\nLikewise, anti-Asian racism is covered only superficially. The horrendous Komagata Maru event is overlooked.\nThe internment of Japanese-Canadians during the Second World War is discussed fleetingly, with no mention of\nnumbers affected (over 22,000), uncompensated liquidation of property, family separation or forced postwar\nrelocation.\nThe guide flags government apologies, but not the racist ideologies and practices justifying such policies. This is\nthe case with anti-Chinese discrimination, including the \"Head Tax, a race-based entry fee,\" and more recently\nwitnessed in hateful attacks on Asian Canadians during both the SARS and COVID-19 pandemics. 3. Amid\noverwhelming, long-standing evidence of systemic police brutality targeting racialized communities, the guide's\nuse of the phrase, \"Remember, the police are there to help you\" contradicts the everyday reality of policing for\nBlack, brown and Indigenous peoples. This includes: repeated instances of violence, racial profiling and\nharassment against Black and Indigenous communities, the RCMP's complicity in missing and murdered\nIndigenous women and girls, and grossly disproportional incarceration of Black and Indigenous populations. 4.\nIn discussing the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the guide is highly selective regarding which rights are\nacknowledged and emphasized. While the guide repeatedly stresses the importance of religious freedom, it fails\nto mention equality and non-discrimination as fundamental rights. This selective presentation of key human\nrights protections gives prospective citizens a distorted picture.\nThe guide also misses the opportunity to endorse key human rights protections against racism, which are\ncentral to mitigating the effects of systemic discrimination on people's well-being, financial security, education\nand work aspirations.\nAdditionally ignored are past and contemporary policies that undermine the rights of racialized migrant\nworkers. Examples of these groups include Black migrants, who historically were only admitted as domestic\nworkers or in other menial roles; Filipino workers recruited to be home care aides and personal support\nworkers; and Latin American and Caribbean migrant farm workers today. Racialized migrants are frequently\ndenied landed immigrant status, family reunification, provincial health coverage, unemployment benefits,\nworkplace protections and other social entitlements and worker protections.\nA replacement citizenship guide is long overdue. A new guide should further highlight working-class struggles\npushing Canada's efforts in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
