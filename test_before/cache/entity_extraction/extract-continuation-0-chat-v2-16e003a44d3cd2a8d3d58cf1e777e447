New\nresearch suggests the pandemic has stoked rising worries about violence and fueled gun ownership.\nPublished in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study relies on data from the 2020 California Safety and WellBeing Survey, which covers topics related to firearm ownership, practices and exposure to violence. The 2,870\nCalifornia adults surveyed reported rising concern about violence during the pandemic. About 1 in 10 were\nconcerned someone they know might harm themselves.\nAbout 7 percent of respondents who reported they had experienced unfair treatment believe it occurred because\nof the pandemic.\nA disproportionate number were Asian Americans, reflecting reports of widespread anti-Asian racism and\nxenophobia throughout the pandemic. The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate reports it received over 2,500\ncomplaints of anti-Asian American discrimination between March and August, including verbal attacks and\npotential civil rights violations.\nThe study also showed new firearm and ammunition purchases during the pandemic in response to concerns\nabout lawlessness, prisoner releases and even government collapse. The researchers estimate that about\n110,000 Californians bought firearms directly in response to the pandemic, 47,000 for the first time.\nAlthough more than half of owners said they store their firearms securely, 1.2 percent - about 55,000 California\nfirearm owners - keep a loaded firearm unlocked in their home, and half of those live with children or\nadolescents.\nWhy does this matter to public health? The researchers point out firearm ownership's links to harm, from\nhomicide to suicide to accidental shootings. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, suicide was the\n10th leading cause of death in the United States, and firearm deaths accounted for about half of those deaths.\nAnother 39,740 people died of firearm violence that year.\nThe researchers say their findings could drive short-term solutions such as community-based violence\ninterventions and temporary, out-of-home firearm storage. And, they say, those solutions could help address\n\"other societal shocks that exacerbate persistent structural, economic, and social inequities\" that drive violence.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The pandemic refers to the global health crisis caused by covid-19, which has led to increased concerns about violence and gun ownership.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a viral disease that has caused a worldwide pandemic, impacting health and safety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMA NETWORK OPEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>JAMA Network Open is a medical journal that published research related to the pandemic's effects on violence and gun ownership.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA SAFETY AND WELL-BEING SURVEY<|>EVENT<|>The California Safety and Well-Being Survey is a study that collects data on firearm ownership and exposure to violence among California adults.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an advocacy group that tracks incidents of anti-Asian American discrimination and violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are individuals of Asian descent living in the United States, who have reported increased discrimination during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Institute of Mental Health is a U.S. government organization that provides information on mental health issues, including the impact of firearm ownership on suicide rates.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANDEMIC<|>COVID-19<|>The pandemic is primarily caused by COVID-19, which has significant health implications<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMA NETWORK OPEN<|>CALIFORNIA SAFETY AND WELL-BEING SURVEY<|>JAMA Network Open published research based on data from the California Safety and Well-Being Survey<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Stop AAPI Hate reports on discrimination faced by Asian Americans during the pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANDEMIC<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The pandemic has led to increased anti-Asian racism and xenophobia<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH<|>PANDEMIC<|>The National Institute of Mental Health provides insights into the mental health impacts of the pandemic, including firearm-related deaths<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANDEMIC<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The pandemic has exacerbated issues of discrimination reported by Stop AAPI Hate<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
