Like the others, he worried that the hostility already had spilled out in the offline\nworld.\n\"I always treat social media data as a good sensor of the real world,\" said Zhang.\nCharissa Cheah, a psychology professor at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County who is leading another study examining discrimination against\nChinese Americans during the pandemic, said anti-Chinese language such as \"kungflu\" and \"batsoup\" have their roots in historically racist tropes that have\nlong been used to denigrate Asian Americans and cast them as foreigners no matter how long they have lived in the United States.\n\"Covid-19 is merely refueling processes that are already there,\" said Cheah, whose research will also study Twitter activity related to the outbreak. \"I worry\nthat we might interpret these findings as, 'Oh, it's covid-19 that's causing it.' This is simply not true. The current pandemic is merely providing an outlet and\nmaking it easier to justify expressions of Sinophobia.\" Covid-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\nAnother indicator of rising hostility toward China is the surging use of Twitter hashtags such as #BlameChina, #ChinaLiedPeopleDied, #ChinaVirus,\n#WuhanCoronaVirus and #ChinaCoronaVirus, according to an unpublished analysis done by Clemson University researcher Darren Linvill.\nThe hashtag #ChineseVirus surged to nearly 130,000 uses the day after Trump used it in a tweet. Linvill, an assistant professor of communication, said the\nuse was particularly prominent among accounts that regularly support Trump on Twitter.\nBut he cautioned that the character of anti-Chinese expressions varies sharply across social media platforms.\n\"Anti-Chinese sentiment is rising, and it manifests itself differently in different places,\" Linvill said. \"On 4chan, it's racist. On Twitter, it's political.\"\nTwitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said that the study by the international group of scholars, which like most academic research on Twitter relied on a 1\npercent sample of all tweets, may miss the \"nuanced political context around content that is posted on Twitter.\"\n\"We have zero-tolerance policies in place that address clear threats of violence, abuse and harassment, and hateful conduct,\" she said. \"If we identify accounts\nthat violate these rules, we'll take enforcement action.\"\nA week after Trump started publicly calling coronavirus the \"Chinese virus\" and defended his use of the label against critics who accused him of being racist,\nthe president implored people on Twitter to \"protect our Asian American community.\"\nThe president also stopped using \"Chinese virus\" on social media and during news briefings.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
