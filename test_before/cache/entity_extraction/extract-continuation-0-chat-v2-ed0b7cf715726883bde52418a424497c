inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent\nand will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on Aug 10.\nThe police added that a 16-year-old boy who was arrested on March 4 in connection with the case has been\nreleased with no further action taken against him.\nOn March 3, Mr Mok, 23, opened up on Facebook about the attack, which took place in Oxford Street near the\nLondon Underground's Tottenham Court Road train station.\nThe University College London law student said he heard a group of young people say \"coronavirus\" as he\nwalked past them at about 9.15pm on Feb 24.\nWhen he turned to face the group, he was punched in the face, with one of the suspects saying \"I don't want\nyour coronavirus in my country\" before the group fled.\nThe incident resulted in Mr Mok having to go for facial surgery, reported Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao.\nOn March 4, the Singapore High Commission in London said on Facebook that it was \"deeply disturbed\" by the\nattack and recognised its \"broader implications\", given the large Singaporean community in Britain.\nIt also promised to ensure that the London Metropolitan Police \"follow through with their investigation with the\nutmost

Why should I keep quiet when someone makes a racist remark\ntowards me?\n\"Racism is not stupidity - racism is hate.
