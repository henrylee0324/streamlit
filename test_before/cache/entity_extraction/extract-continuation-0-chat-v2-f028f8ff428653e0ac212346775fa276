The surge of\nopenly racist and xenophobic attacks has only exacerbated the dark reality of a cruel pandemic overshadowing\nthe globe.\nBut this tragic situation has also sparked hopeful activism, forging some new heroes in the battle against racism\nand discrimination - including Xiaojiu Zhu PhD, MBE, a distinguished lawyer at the Cruickshanks firm in London,\nthe United Kingdom.\nIn the face of rising reports of discrimination against the Chinese community in the UK, including stories of\nchildren being targeted at school, Zhu believed something needed to be done. And as a lawyer, she considered it\nher duty to help people in the Chinese community protect their interests and legal rights.\nZhu came up with the idea of having an online forum for Chinese communities on responding to racism during\nthe pandemic. The May 27 event, organized by the UK Beijing Association, the UK Society of Chinese Lawyers,\nand the Roundtable of Southern California Chinese-American Organizations, featured keynote speakers -\nincluding Zhu - who encouraged people to take positive actions against racism and discrimination, such as\nreporting incidents to authorities and taking legal recourse.\nMore than 8,000 people from over 10 countries attended the forum, and the online replay attracted some\n10,000 views. This extraordinary reception was a testament to the significance of racism to Chinese around the world, and made Zhu realize the need for an international group to forward the cause.\nBuilding on this momentum, Zhu founded the International Chinese Alliance Against Racism (ICAAR), uniting\nover 100 lawyers, leaders of Chinese communities and media representatives from over 30 countries and\nregions to inspire Chinese around the world to combat racial discrimination. Every day, members of the WeChat\ngroup share and exchange information on the topic, to raise awareness and spur more people to safeguard their\nrights. And in the future, Zhu hopes to expand and strengthen the alliance by inviting more individuals to join in\nwhile also ramping up efforts to promote the group.\nWhile Zhu's leadership has arrived at an urgent time, I believe the international Chinese community has long\nneeded a prominent lawyer to champion this cause. Racial discrimination didn't begin with the COVID-19\npandemic. And victims living in a foreign country may not always understand their rights under the law or even\nfeel inclined to act, such as filing a police report or a lawsuit. After all, in a March 2020 Chinese-language news\nreport by China News Service, Zhu noted that most overseas Chinese habitually endure discrimination in silence.\nI've observed this sad reality among my Chinese friends in the US, who have shared with me far too many tales\nof suffering such indignities on their own, as part of \"eating bitterness\" abroad. But if there had been an\ninternational movement against racism and discrimination, supporting people to stand up for their rights, I\nbelieve my friends' stories may have had ended with something closer to justice.\nMy hope is that Zhu and the alliance represent a turning point in the international Chinese community and its\nallies, a time marked by the emergence of powerful anti-discrimination activism around the world. Her\nleadership may galvanize a new generation of Chinese - who in the face of discrimination, may choose courage\nand action, confident in the knowledge that they are not alone in this fight.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>XIAOJIU ZHU<|>PERSON<|>Xiaojiu Zhu is a distinguished lawyer at the Cruickshanks firm in London, UK, and an activist against racism and discrimination, particularly for the Chinese community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRUICKSHANKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Cruickshanks firm is a law firm in London where Xiaojiu Zhu works, focusing on legal rights and interests of the Chinese community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK BEIJING ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The UK Beijing Association is an organization that participated in organizing an event to combat racism against the Chinese community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK SOCIETY OF CHINESE LAWYERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The UK Society of Chinese Lawyers is an organization that collaborated in organizing an event aimed at addressing racism and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROUND TABLE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHINESE-AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Roundtable of Southern California Chinese-American Organizations is an organization that helped organize an event focused on anti-racism efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL CHINESE ALLIANCE AGAINST RACISM (ICAAR)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ICAAR is an organization founded by Xiaojiu Zhu to unite lawyers and community leaders to combat racial discrimination against the Chinese community globally.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAY 27 EVENT<|>EVENT<|>The May 27 event was an online forum organized to address racism and discrimination against the Chinese community, featuring keynote speakers including Xiaojiu Zhu.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONDON<|>GEO<|>London is the capital city of the United Kingdom where Xiaojiu Zhu practices law and advocates for the Chinese community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>GEO<|>The United Kingdom is the country where the events of discrimination against the Chinese community are occurring and where Xiaojiu Zhu is based.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIU ZHU<|>CRUICKSHANKS<|>Xiaojiu Zhu works at the Cruickshanks firm, where she advocates for the legal rights of the Chinese community<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIU ZHU<|>UK BEIJING ASSOCIATION<|>Xiaojiu Zhu collaborated with the UK Beijing Association to organize an event against racism<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIU ZHU<|>UK SOCIETY OF CHINESE LAWYERS<|>Xiaojiu Zhu worked with the UK Society of Chinese Lawyers to organize an event focused on combating racism<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIU ZHU<|>ROUND TABLE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHINESE-AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS<|>Xiaojiu Zhu partnered with the Roundtable to organize an event aimed at addressing racism<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIU ZHU<|>INTERNATIONAL CHINESE ALLIANCE AGAINST RACISM (ICAAR)<|>Xiaojiu Zhu founded ICAAR to unite efforts against racial discrimination affecting the Chinese community<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAY 27 EVENT<|>UK BEIJING ASSOCIATION<|>The UK Beijing Association was involved in organizing the May 27 event to combat racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAY 27 EVENT<|>UK SOCIETY OF CHINESE LAWYERS<|>The UK Society of Chinese Lawyers helped organize the May 27 event focused on anti-racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAY 27 EVENT<|>ROUND TABLE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHINESE-AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS<|>The Roundtable was involved in organizing the May 27 event aimed at addressing racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIU ZHU<|>MAY 27 EVENT<|>Xiaojiu Zhu was a keynote speaker at the May 27 event, encouraging actions against racism<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL CHINESE ALLIANCE AGAINST RACISM (ICAAR)<|>XIAOJIU ZHU<|>Xiaojiu Zhu's leadership in ICAAR represents a significant movement against racism for the Chinese community<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LONDON<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>London is the capital city of the United Kingdom where the events discussed are taking place<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
