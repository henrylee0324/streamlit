As the abuse escalated - \"very negative comments [about] the coronavirus ... go home, you don't belong here\" - the man punched her in the head twice, knocking her to the ground.\nHolmes, 27, is an indigenous Canadian.\n\"I've been in situations like this before, being indigenous,\" Holmes said. \"I try not to get involved. I try not to say anything back ... I think the only thing I said was 'I'm not Asian, I'm indigenous, I'm from here, I've been here my whole life'.\"\nHolmes' experience is not unique.\nIn Montreal, Inuit woman Sue Simigak said she was abused on the city's subway on April 4 by a man who similarly mistook her for being Chinese and told her to \"get out of my own country\". She posted pictures on Facebook showing a man giving her the finger from a subway platform.\nAnti-racism activist Fo Niemi said indigenous people in Canada, particularly the Inuit, were often mistaken for Asians \"due to their physical features\".\nThe cases of Holmes and Simigak showed how racism could spread amid the pandemic, said Niemi, co-founder and executive director of the Montreal-based Centre for Research Action on Race Relations.\n\"Rising incidents and reports of anti-Asian racism and xenophobia can spread to other groups in Canada who look Asian, ranging from Inuit people to Latin Americans,\" Niemi said.\nGrand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, issued a statement in response to the attack on Holmes, who works at the organisation.\nIt said the union was \"disgusted\" by the incident and offered \"sympathy and solidarity to Asian communities who have borne the brunt of Covid-19 related racism\".\nHolmes' case was being handled by the Vancouver Police Department's hate crimes investigators, spokesman Sergeant Aaron Roed said.\n\"Our initial investigation shows that a person was assaulted and this may have been related to race ... the victim did have minor physical injuries and did not need medical treatment the night of the incident,\" Roed said.\nNo arrests have been made, and police were seeking witnesses to the incident, Roed said. Holmes said her attacker was a Caucasian man, about 180cm tall and weighing about 90kg, wearing a hat and a dark jumper.\nShe said the man had passed her from the opposite direction and was about two metres behind her when she sneezed because of her seasonal allergies. He immediately started shouting abuse.\n\"When I turned around to face him, he started coming at me, yelling in my face and then he punched me, in the jaw, and then above my eye, my temple area,\" she said.\nHolmes said she fell to the ground, but felt she was saved from worse by Kato, a 45kg Dogo Argentino that Holmes adopted three years ago. Kato started biting at the man's ankles.\nThe man responded by threatening to have authorities confiscate Kato because the dog was \"being aggressive\". With Kato straining at the end of his leash, the man eventually ran off.\nHolmes returned to her nearby home and called her father, Don Bain - a special adviser to British Columbia Premier John Horgan - who calmed her down. An hour later she called the police and met them back at the park.\n   Niemi said a wave of anti-Asian racism linked to the coronavirus had caught many places unprepared.\nTraditional responses to tackle racism \"do not always work effectively with Asian communities\", said Niemi, because of cultural, social and language factors \"which led many Asians not to talk openly about racism, much less reporting racist acts\".\nIn Vancouver, police have warned of a recent spike in hate crimes amid the pandemic. Before the attack on Holmes, there had been 20 anti-Asian hate crimes reported this year - 16 of them in March and April - compared with 12 in all of 2019.\nIncidents in Vancouver have included a 92-year-old man surnamed Kwong who was assaulted and thrown out of a 7-Eleven store by a customer, and an Asian woman wearing a face mask who was punched in the face by another pedestrian.\nAuthorities have also noted the phenomenon. Horgan condemned \"disturbing stories of a rise in anti-Asian racist behaviour since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic\", adding that \"racism is also a virus\".\nHenry Shuen Ngei Yu, a history professor at the University of British Columbia, said the attack on Holmes could not properly be understood as simply about \"mistaken identity\".\n\"Why do we think this is a case of mistaken identity?\" asked Yu. \"White supremacy historically has relied on defining non-white 'races' as abstract categories that generally are not coherent ... we should pause whenever we begin to think that something has gone awry in situations like this, as if, if the target had actually been 'correctly' identified as Chinese that we should be somehow less perturbed because it somehow made sense,\" Yu said.\nHolmes said she had previously been mistaken for being Asian \"but not like this\".\n\"The only reason I'm sharing this story is that racism is not OK. If anyone else experiences something like this they should speak out. We're all in this together.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GRAY'S PARK<|>GEO<|>Gray's Park is a public park located in Vancouver's Eastside where the incident involving Dakota Holmes occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANCOUVER<|>GEO<|>Vancouver is a major city in Canada where the incident of racial abuse took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAKOTA HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Dakota Holmes is a 27-year-old indigenous Canadian who experienced racial abuse while walking her dog in Vancouver.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATO<|>PERSON<|>Kato is a 45kg Dogo Argentino dog adopted by Dakota Holmes, who intervened during the attack.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUE SIMIGAK<|>PERSON<|>Sue Simigak is an Inuit woman who experienced racial abuse on the subway in Montreal.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FO NIEMI<|>PERSON<|>Fo Niemi is an anti-racism activist and co-founder of the Centre for Research Action on Race Relations in Montreal.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAND CHIEF STEWART PHILLIP<|>PERSON<|>Stewart Phillip is the president of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs who issued a statement regarding the attack on Dakota Holmes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANCOUVER POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Vancouver Police Department is responsible for investigating the hate crime incident involving Dakota Holmes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN HORGAN<|>PERSON<|>John Horgan is the Premier of British Columbia and the father of Dakota Holmes' special adviser, Don Bain.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DON BAIN<|>PERSON<|>Don Bain is a special adviser to British Columbia Premier John Horgan and the father of Dakota Holmes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is the pandemic that has been linked to a rise in anti-Asian racism and xenophobia in Canada.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAKOTA HOLMES<|>KATO<|>Kato, Dakota Holmes' dog, intervened during the attack, helping to protect her from further harm.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAKOTA HOLMES<|>VANCOUVER<|>Dakota Holmes experienced racial abuse in Vancouver, highlighting issues of racism in the city.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUE SIMIGAK<|>VANCOUVER<|>Sue Simigak's experience of racial abuse in Montreal is part of a broader pattern of racism affecting indigenous people in Canada, including those in Vancouver.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FO NIEMI<|>DAKOTA HOLMES<|>Fo Niemi commented on the incidents of racism faced by indigenous people, including Dakota Holmes, during the pandemic.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAND CHIEF STEWART PHILLIP<|>DAKOTA HOLMES<|>Stewart Phillip issued a statement in response to the attack on Dakota Holmes, showing solidarity with her experience.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANCOUVER POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>DAKOTA HOLMES<|>The Vancouver Police Department is investigating the hate crime incident involving Dakota Holmes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN HORGAN<|>DON BAIN<|>John Horgan is the Premier of British Columbia and Don Bain is his special adviser, linking them through their professional relationship.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>DAKOTA HOLMES<|>The rise in anti-Asian racism linked to COVID-19 is relevant to Dakota Holmes' experience of racial abuse.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
