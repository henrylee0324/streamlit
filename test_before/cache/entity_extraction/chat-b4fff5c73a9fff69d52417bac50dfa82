Sin’s collaborative project at Junzi Kitchen shows the global reach of his home country’s cuisine. (Jenny Huang/The New York Times)Lucas Sin was recently telling a Dominican cook about hong dou sha, a red bean soup popular as a chilled Cantonese summer dessert. “Oh, yeah,” Sin recalled the cook’s saying, “habichuelas con dulce.”The Dominican Eastertime dessert, also a cold red bean soup, is spiced with cloves, while the Chinese treat is cinnamon-driven, and the Dominican version has more milk, but the dishes are unmistakable culinary cousins.It was an aha moment, unlocking for both chefs the cuisine of China’s far-flung diaspora. “We didn’t know,” Sin said, “because how often do Chinese and Dominican chefs really talk?”As far back as the ancient Silk Road and up through the diasporas of the 19th and 20th centuries, Chinese émigrés have made their homes across the world. Wherever they did, local riffs on recipes — then riffs upon riffs — were born.Consider the halal Hui dishes of Cairo, chop suey in San Francisco, egg rolls in New York, a deep-fried shumailike beef dimmy in Sydney, Big Mac baos in Toronto or sweet-and-sour fish in the Chinês clandestinos of Lisbon, Portugal. Some, such as Kazakhstan’s laghman noodles, are national staples. There are whole cuisines — Chuka in Japan or Chifa in Peru — made up of interpreted Chinese recipes, including dishes as common as ramen or lomo saltado. All are satellite culinary provinces of mainland China.Such has been the view of Sin, 27, a wunderkind chef who first opened a restaurant at 16 in an abandoned factory in Hong Kong, then ran a diner out of his dorm room at Yale. He is now the executive chef at Junzi Kitchen, a fledgling fast-casual chain serving modern Chinese food.Because that food did not exist in the Hong Kong of his youth, Sin has an unabashed love of Chinese American fare, especially at Wo Hop, an 82-year-old classic in Manhattan’s Chinatown. “It was new to me, and so exciting that it didn’t occur to me for years that Chinese food is too simple and monolithic in the U.S.,” he said.He was disturbed, then, by how easily anti-Asian sentiment and violence surged — even in places like New York — as the coronavirus pandemic shut down the planet. Strangers tossed half-filled cans of beer at him. One threw a long, fluorescent light bulb at him like a javelin.“It took me coming to New York to start really understanding what it meant to be a minority,” he said. “It’s disappointing that people who like our food and eat our food all the time are so quick to attack and deface Chinese restaurants.”To counter the parochialism of quarantine, in March Sin started Distance Dining (“a dinner series about how Chinese food connects the world”) to highlight dishes of the Chinese emigrant population — at 10.7 million, the world’s third-largest, behind Mexico’s 11.8 million and India’s 17.5 million. They call themselves sanju, which translates to “scattered living.”The pop-up meals — which are put together at Junzi from elements prepared by Sin and collaborating chefs — are available by delivery roughly once a week and accompanied by an Instagram Live session explaining their origins and interplay.China is home to some 56 officially recognized ethnic groups, and the culinary trend for Chinese food in recent years has leaned toward Imperial recipes and hyperregional cuisines — Fujianese, Hunanese, Sichuanese, Shanghainese, Uighur, Xianese, Yunnanese. But Sin’s program, by provocative contrast, has embraced the authenticity of Chinese cuisine’s globalism while avoiding “fusion,” a term that has widely curdled into a slur among gourmands.“This is confluence, not influence,” Sin said.Andrew Doro, a Chinese American food blogger intent on eating dishes from every nation in the world, without leaving New York City, favors Guyanese Chinese dishes like fried bangamary (a fish) and crispy cha chi gai.“There are so many more types of Chinese food than even most Chinese people realize,” Doro said.Sin was suddenly partnering with celebrated restaurants left and right: Malaysian lobak and buckwheat mochi with Kopitiam, Taiwanese pineapple egg tart with Spot Dessert Bar, Thai khao soi and Yunnanese paoluda with Fish Cheeks, or Vietnamese bun bo Teochew and che bap with Madame Vo. Collaborations serve up to 200 diners, and two superfans have eaten all of the 14 meals so far.As the zeitgeist shifted from pandemic panic toward rage for racial equity, inspired by the killing of George Floyd, Sin tweaked his program: Soon he was messaging with Kia Damon and Ghetto Gastro, a collective of food lovers based in the Bronx.They discussed dishes as varied as yakamein, the Afro-Chinese soup of New Orleans — which Sin made with Damon for one dinner — or what chef Eddie Huang and others call “hood Chinese” food, like the chicken wings served in many New York neighborhoods. The Chinese diaspora, it turns out, is remarkably agile.“China is this incredible beacon in food,” said Marcus Samuelsson, the Ethiopian-Swedish host of “No Passport Required,” who has made Harlem his home. “We’re relearning about heritage, culture and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
