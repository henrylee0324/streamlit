Fueling the fire, President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as “the China virus.”\n“That old-school rhetoric that we eat bats, dogs and rats — that racism is still alive and well,\" said Clarence\nKwan, creator of the anti-racist cooking zine “Chinese Protest Recipes.” The speed with which such false\nstereotypes resurfaced during the pandemic is \"a reflection of how little progress we’ve made,” Kwan said.\nIn the Wuhan market where the virus is believed to possibly have originated, vendors also advertised wildlife for\nsale. Of the 33 samples from the market that tested positive for the coronavirus, officials say 31 were from the\narea where wildlife booths were concentrated. But wildlife and other “exotic” animals are not part of the modern\nmainstream Asian diet, either in Asian countries or in the US\nAll of the misinformation has had serious consequences.\nStop AAPI Hate, a coalition of Asian-American advocacy groups, issued a report in August stating that it had\nreceived more than 2,500 reports of hate and discrimination across the country since the group was founded in\nMarch, around the time the outbreak began to seriously worsen in the US The group said it received data from\n47 states, with 46% of the incidents taking place in California, followed by 14 percent in New York.\nIn addition, Asian-American small businesses have been among the hardest hit by the economic downturn\nduring the pandemic. While there was a 22 percent decline in all small business-owner activity nationwide from\nFebruary to April, Asian-American business-owner activity dropped by 26 percent, according to a study by the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research.\nMany businesses that survived have been subject to stigmatization, Kwan said. “Restaurants have been\nvandalized. As if the pandemic wasn’t hard enough, there’s this added threat to Asian businesses of this\nlingering hate.”\nConversations about the stigmatization of Asian food reached a crescendo this month when Philli Armitage-\nMattin, a contestant on “MasterChef: The Professionals,” used the phrase “Dirty Food Refined” and the hashtag\n#prettydirtyfood in her Instagram bio, which described her as an Asian food specialist.\n“In a year where Chinese and East Asian communities have essentially been blamed for the pandemic and\nchastised as ‘dirty,’ this type of narrative is completely unacceptable,” Kwan wrote on Instagram.\nArmitage-Mattin's bio has since been changed and the London-based chef apologized on Instagram, while also\ninsisting that she had never meant to insult anyone.\n“The way I mean food to be ‘dirty’ is indulgent street food; food that comforts you as in, ‘going out for a dirty\nburger,’” she wrote.\nBut Kwan said especially in the current climate, such phrases can be dangerous.\n“It was a very flippant, ignorant, tone-deaf way of talking about Asian food,” he said.\nRacist rhetoric referring to Asian food as dirty or disease-laden dates back to the 1850s, said Ellen Wu, a history\nprofessor at Indiana University. Wu said the false notion that Chinese people eat rat or dog meat is rooted in the\nxenophobic fears of white workers who used Chinese immigrant workers as a scapegoat for their economic\nwoes.\n“To white Americans, these new immigrants were different in a threatening way, and there is fear of the ‘other,’\nof difference,” said Wu, who is Asian-American.\nEnglish professor Anita Mannur of Miami University said the current crisis reminds her of racist cartoons from\nthe late 1800s that advertised for rat poison by picturing a Chinese man about to eat one of the rodents.\nMannur, who is Indian-American, said other persistent false narratives such as that Chinese American\nneighborhoods or Chinatowns are dens of vice send the message that Asian people are less civilized, and do\n\"very immediate damage.”\n“People have had their houses graffitied with things like ‘Dog eaters live here,’\" she said. “People are beaten up\nand spat on. People are told to go back to China.”\nBenny Yun, owner of the Yang Chow restaurant in Los Angeles’ Chinatown district and two other locations in\nSouthern California, said even though his businesses have survived the pandemic, they get prank calls almost\ndaily asking if they have dog or cat on the menu or impersonating a thick Asian accent.\n“The worst part is if they realize you speak perfect English, then they just give you a random order and we\nprepare it and they don’t even come to pick it up. Waste of time and money,” Yun said.\nFor years, health inspectors have been accused of docking points from Chinese restaurants for employing\ntraditional cooking and presentation methods, such as hanging roast duck in the front window. The common\nyet scientifically disproven claim that MSG causes illness made the Chinese food flavor enhancer highly\nunpopular in the 1970s, forcing many Asian-American restaurants to eliminate it from their kitchens.\nKwan said it is important for Asian-Americans to protest the way they are being treated; to push back against\nthe latest onslaught of bias and racism by continuing to unabashedly celebrate their food and culture.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is a city in China where the virus is believed to have possibly originated, particularly in its wet markets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is the country where Wuhan is located and has been associated with the initial outbreak of the virus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSOCIATED PRESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Associated Press is a news organization that reported on the initial evidence regarding the virus's origins.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States who referred to COVID-19 as “the China virus.”)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLARENCE KWAN<|>PERSON<|>Clarence Kwan is the creator of the anti-racist cooking zine “Chinese Protest Recipes” and has spoken out against racism related to Asian food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a coalition of Asian-American advocacy groups that tracks incidents of hate and discrimination against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHILLI ARMITAGE-MATTIN<|>PERSON<|>Philli Armitage-Mattin is a contestant on “MasterChef: The Professionals” who faced backlash for her Instagram bio referencing “Dirty Food Refined.”)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YANG CHOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yang Chow is a restaurant owned by Benny Yun located in Los Angeles’ Chinatown district.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIANA UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Indiana University is where Ellen Wu, a history professor, teaches and has commented on the historical context of racism against Asian communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIAMI UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Miami University is where Anita Mannur, an English professor, teaches and has discussed the impact of racist narratives on Asian communities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WUHAN<|>CHINA<|>Wuhan is a city located in China, which is central to the narrative of the virus's origin.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSOCIATED PRESS<|>WUHAN<|>The Associated Press reported on the initial evidence regarding the virus's origins in Wuhan.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>CHINA<|>Donald Trump referred to COVID-19 as “the China virus,” linking the virus to China in public discourse.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLARENCE KWAN<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Clarence Kwan has spoken out against racism and the stigmatization of Asian food, which is a concern addressed by Stop AAPI Hate.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHILLI ARMITAGE-MATTIN<|>CLARENCE KWAN<|>Philli Armitage-Mattin's controversial Instagram bio was criticized by Clarence Kwan, highlighting the sensitivity around Asian food narratives.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YANG CHOW<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Yang Chow, as an Asian-American restaurant, has been affected by the discrimination tracked by Stop AAPI Hate.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIANA UNIVERSITY<|>CLARENCE KWAN<|>Ellen Wu from Indiana University has discussed the historical context of racism that Clarence Kwan addresses in his activism.<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIAMI UNIVERSITY<|>CLARENCE KWAN<|>Anita Mannur from Miami University has also commented on the impact of racism that Clarence Kwan speaks against.<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ASSOCIATED PRESS<|>The Associated Press reported on Donald Trump's rhetoric regarding COVID-19, which has been linked to increased racism against Asian communities.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
