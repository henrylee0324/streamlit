And if you lose that relationship with China . it will be devastating, not only for us here.\"\nAustralian commercial media, in particular, have been drumming up anti-China sentiments in the country by repeatedly claiming that China is using its economic muscle to bully Australia, after spreading the coronavirus\nacross the globe. They are also appealing to widespread resentments among Australians of Chinese purchases of large Australian assets as well as real estate in recent years.\n\"Australia has taken the view that the purchase of Australian assets by Chinese state corporations has strategic as well as economic parameters,\" argues Professor Jakubowicz. He commented on why there is no such resentment against widespread purchases of Australian assets by the British and American companies.\n\"My sense is (that) the perceived threat of Chinese imperial power from a one-party state bent on extending its empire, is more challenging in Australia than competing corporate interests from other former or existing empires.\"\nThis resentment of Chinese economic power and the media's persistent attempts to project COVID-19 as a 'Chinese export' is reflected in a rise in racist attacks on Asian (Chinese)-Australians in recent months, where ordinary Australians have called them spreaders of coronavirus.\n\"I have been verbally racially abused several times since the arrival of COVID-19,\" says Pang. \"My wife, a third- generation Australian, was called 'coronavirus'. Her grandfather arrived in Australia from China in the late 1800s.\" Her Chinese-Australian father had served with the Australian Armoured Division in World War II (1939-1945) and her uncle in Borneo as an Infantry.\n\"My friend's daughter was spitted on, and his shoulder elbowed another friend at a supermarket by a male,\" he adds.\n[The Borneo campaign of 1945 was one of the most complex operations involving Australian land, air and sea forces in the war. It was also the last Australian campaign to be planned and undertaken. Borneo had been captured by the Japanese in early 1942.]\nTrent Zimmerman, Member of Parliament for North Sydney - an electorate that includes over 20,000 Asian- Australians - raised the issue of such public attacks in parliament in Canberra on May 18.\n\"It does disappoint me enormously to have to rise in this chamber to raise and condemn the racism experienced by some in the Australian Chinese community during this pandemic,\" he told the parliament.\nWhile admitting that most Australians would support the call for an independent international inquiry on the role of wet markets in the origins of the coronavirus, these attacks \"are not what this is about\", he noted.\nWith the Government taking a blame game strategy, there are concerns among liberal and academic circles that the community sentiments that led to the 'White Australia' policy may be re-emerging.\nBut, Ruddock argues that Australia's approach to foreign investments is not different from China's. \"All substantial proposals are reviewed through the Foreign Investment Review Board. This is not surprising. Even China takes a critical view of foreign investment in China,\" he says. He adds: \"Government policy is non-discriminatory based on race (but) restrictions on ownership by foreign nationals do exist.\"\nAs for the 'White Australia' policy resurfacing, Ruddock says, \"(it) was abandoned some 50 years ago and there is no place in Australia for any discrimination based on race, country of origin, culture or religion\".\nProfessor Jakubowicz agrees that the abolition of the 'White Australia' policy \"has worked reasonably well\". However, he thinks that racialised thinking still sits strongly within the hierarchies of political parties, in the mass media, and the public sphere. \"COVID-19 period has permitted racists to target Chinese and other Asian Australians, but there has also been widespread civil society push back,\" he points out. But, Pang has reservations.\n\"Many of my Asian Australian friends are shocked at the sudden spate of racism arising from COVID-19, despite efforts from community organisations' initiative to call on media and politicians to curtail racism, the incidence of racism continues,\" he maintains.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
