Reilly said Thursday night that the \"matter has already come to the attention of\nthe dean who is already looking into this on behalf of the student.\"\nSotzing said he has been in contact with UC's Dean of Engineering and Applied Science, John Weidner, who he\nsays is \"looking into it.\"\nWeidner said he referred the matter for review to the university's Office of Equal Opportunity and Access. That\ndepartment handles inquiries regarding discrimination, harassment or retaliation based on disability, race, color,\nreligion, national origin and other identities, according to their website.\n\"These types of xenophobic comments and stigmatizations around location or ethnicity are more than troubling.\nWe can better protect and care for all when we speak about COVID-19 with both accuracy and empathy – something we should all strive for,\" Weidner wrote to The Enquirer.\nEmails lay out incident\nSotzing received the email from John Ucker, who is listed as an adjunct instructor in UC's College of Engineering\nand Applied Science. He did not reply to an email from The Enquirer Thursday evening.\nIn emails forwarded to The Enquirer, Sotzing, a third-year engineering student, wrote to Ucker that he would not\nbe able to attend an in-person lab scheduled for Tuesday because his girlfriend tested positive for the novel\ncoronavirus at UC's University Health Services.\nSotzing was tested the same day, he said, and he received a negative COVID-19 result. However, Sotzing said\nthe university's health officials told him to quarantine for two weeks because of his proximity to a positive\npatient.\nThose tests were taken on Sept. 4, Sotzing said. The lab was scheduled for Tuesday, on Sept. 15, which would\nhave fallen in the two-week quarantine time period.\nSotzing provided photo evidence of his test results in an email to Ucker, and wrote that he had been told not to\nattend any in-person classes until Thursday. Ucker did not reply to Sotzing's email until after the in-person lab\nhad already happened.\n\"For students testing positive for the chinese (sic) virus, I will give no grade,\" the email reads. \"You can read the\ninfo I sent to the class re: the torsion test.\"\n'This kind of language is completely unacceptable'\nUC stated in its Return to Campus Guide that it encourages faculty to be flexible with students, especially in\nregards to attendance policies during the pandemic. Weidner said Ucker has a \"routine policy\" of allowing\nstudents to forego one of the lab tests so that a grade will not be recorded.\nUC has reported 321 COVID-19 cases among students as of Thursday. Hamilton County officials said this week\nthe positive rate for the new coronavirus is spiking in Cincinnati's Corryville, Mount Auburn and CUF (Clifton\nHeights/University Heights/Fairview) neighborhoods around UC.\nSotzing said he is not clear whether Ucker's message meant he was getting a zero grade or if the professor is\nmerely not grading the assignment.\n\"This kind of language is completely unacceptable. And especially from people, like, in power... it has no place in\nthis country and it contributes to Asian xenophobia,\" Sotzing said.\nSotzing posted the professor's email response on Twitter Thursday afternoon.\n\"My girlfriend tested positive for COVID and the University of Cincinnati's Health Department instructed me to\nnot attend my in-person lab. Not only did my professor give me a zero for not going, but this was his response,\"\nthe post reads, with a screenshot of the email. Within three hours, the post had over 6,000 likes and over 2,000\nretweets.\n\"He needs to apologize for the fact that he made that comment,\" Sotzing told The Enquirer Thursday.\nHarassment rising towardAsian Americans\nNews of the investigation came on the same day that the U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure\ncondemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIncreased numbers of Asian Americans have reported harassment and even physical assaults amid political\nrhetoric blaming China for the pandemic from President Donald Trump and others. The House measure, a nonbinding resolution, does not require the Senate to pass it, nor does it require the president's signature The Tangeman University Center at the University of Cincinnati's campus on March 11.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
