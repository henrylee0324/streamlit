Say the term again.\"\nTrump said he did not believe Asian Americans would be negatively affected by the use of the phrase.\nPresident Donald Trump said he did not believe the term \"kung-flu\" and other discriminatory phrases would put Asian Americans at risk of xenophobic attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe disparaging term was privately used by a White House official to CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang, a Chinese American, on Tuesday morning.\n\"Makes me wonder what they're calling it behind my back,\" Jiang said in a tweet.\nTrump pressed for more details when he was asked if he believed Asian Americans could be subjected to increased racist attacks because of similar terms. \"I wonder who said that,\" Trump said to a reporter at the White House on Wednesday. \"You know who said that? Say the term again.\"\nAfter the reporter repeated the phrase, it was still not clear if Trump understood the belittling implication and the relationship it has with Asians.\nTrump said he did not believe Asian Americans would be negatively affected by the use of the phrase, which he said had to do with coronavirus' origins in China. Trump and numerous Republican lawmakers have described the coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus,\" based on the initial cases in the country. Critics — including the Chinese government — have urged them not to use the term.\n\"No, not at all,\" Trump said. \"I think they'd probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There's nothing not to agree on.\"\nRobert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testified in a congressional hearing earlier in March that he agreed it was inappropriate to describe the virus as the \"Chinese coronavirus\" because it had spread across the world.\n\"Public health emergencies ... are stressful times for people and communities,\" the CDC wrote on its website. \"Fear and anxiety about a disease can lead to social stigma toward people, places, or things.\"\n\"For example, stigma and discrimination can occur when people associate a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population or nationality, even though not everyone in that population or from that region is specifically at risk for the disease,\" the CDC website said.\nSeveral hate crimes and acts of discriminatory behavior against Asian Americans were documented across the US in recent weeks amid the coronavirus pandemic. An Asian man who declined to be identified alleged a 44-year-old man named Raoul Ramos screamed at him on Saturday for not wearing a mask while he was walking with his 10-year-old son in New York, the New York Post reported.\n  \"The guy walked past us. That triggered him. He was screaming at us and said, 'Where the f--- is your mask?'\" the man said to the Post.\n\"You f---ing Chinese,\" Ramos said, according to the Post's police sources.\nRamos, who is accused of hitting the Asian man in the head before fleeing, was arrested.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the President of the United States who commented on the use of the term 'kung-flu' and its implications for Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEIJIA JIANG<|>PERSON<|>Weijia Jiang is a Chinese American CBS News reporter who was the recipient of the disparaging term 'kung-flu' from a White House official.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAOUL RAMOS<|>PERSON<|>Raoul Ramos is a 44-year-old man accused of verbally and physically assaulting an Asian man during the coronavirus pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The CDC is a national public health agency in the United States that provides information and guidelines regarding public health emergencies, including the coronavirus pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The coronavirus pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to widespread fear, anxiety, and discrimination against certain populations, particularly Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a state in the United States where incidents of discrimination against Asian Americans have been reported during the coronavirus pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>WEIJIA JIANG<|>Donald Trump made comments regarding the term 'kung-flu' which was directed at Weijia Jiang, a Chinese American reporter<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<|>Donald Trump referenced the CDC's stance on the terminology used for the coronavirus in relation to its origins<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEIJIA JIANG<|>CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC<|>Weijia Jiang's experience with the term 'kung-flu' is a reflection of the discrimination faced by Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAOUL RAMOS<|>NEW YORK<|>Raoul Ramos was involved in a hate crime incident against an Asian man in New York during the coronavirus pandemic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAOUL RAMOS<|>CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC<|>Raoul Ramos's actions are indicative of the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<|>CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC<|>The CDC provides guidelines and information regarding the public health implications of the coronavirus pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC<|>Donald Trump's comments about the coronavirus pandemic and its terminology have implications for public perception and discrimination<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
