We are committed to working with the US side for non-conflict,\nnon-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. At the same time, we are firmly committed to\nsafeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests. China urges the US to discard its Cold-War\nmentality and ideological bias, view the world and China-US relations in the 21st century in a correct way, and work\nwith China to move forward the bilateral relations along the track of coordination, cooperation and stability.\nChina Daily: It is reported that Côte d'Ivoire's Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly passed away on July 8. What's\nyour comment?\nZhao Lijian: We deeply mourn the passing of Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly and extend sincere condolences to\nthe government of Côte d'Ivoire and his family.\nPrime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly was friendly to China and made contributions to the development of China-Côte\nd'Ivoire relations. China stands ready to work with Côte d'Ivoire for more progress in our friendly cooperation.\nThe Paper: According to people familiar with the matter, Chinese and Indian armies are expected to carry out a joint\nverification to assess the implementation of the disengagement process once the withdrawal of troops is completed in\nthe western sector of China-India boundary. The two militaries are set to hold extensive talks on bringing back peace\nand tranquility in the region. Can you confirm that and give us some updates on the disengagement? Will there be\nmore bilateral talks between Chinese and Indian troops?\nZhao Lijian: Following the consensus reached at the commander-level talks, the Chinese and India border troops have\nbeen taking effective measures to disengage at Galwan Valley and other areas in the western sector. The overall\nsituation at the China-India boundary is stable and ameliorating. The two sides will continue to maintain dialogue and\ncommunication through military and diplomatic channels, including holding a new round of commander-level talks and\nthe meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs. We hope India\nwill work with China towards the same goal to implement consensus reached between the two sides with concrete\nactions and jointly de-escalate tensions in the border region.\nBBC: Earlier you mentioned that Australia was in breach of basic norms governing international relations with its\ncomments and moves regarding Hong Kong. Can you tell us which laws they are?\nZhao Lijian: Isn't \"non-interference in other countries' internal affairs\" a basic norm governing international\nrelations? Do I have to elaborate?\nAssociated Press of Pakistan: According to reports, Chinese and Pakistani experts held a video conference on\nCOVID-19 yesterday. Could you give us more details?Zhao Lijian: Experts from China and Pakistan held a video conference on COVID-19 on July 8.

Participants include Chinese\nAmbassador to Pakistan Yao Jing, experts of China's National Health Commission, representatives of Pakistan's\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and embassy in China, and public health experts from both countries. Chinese experts\nbriefed their Pakistani colleagues on China's prevention and control experience, practices in clinical diagnosis and\ntreatment and the progress in vaccine research and development. They also took questions raised by the Pakistani\nside.\nBoth sides spoke highly of the mutual support and close cooperation since the epidemic broke out. They believe this\nmeeting further enhances mutual understanding and agree to continuously strengthen technical exchange,\nexperience sharing and cooperation on vaccine R&D, jointly cope with the epidemics and uphold public health\nsecurity of the two countries and the world at large.\nAFP: Yesterday French foreign minister said that France was considering taking measures in response to China's\nimplementation of the law on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong. He didn't specify what these measures\ncould be, but several European countries could join the move. Do you have any comment on that?\nZhao Lijian: We noticed the reports. I'd like to stress that Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs that allow no\nforeign interference. We hope those countries can view the Law in a fair and objective manner, exercise prudence in\ntheir words and deeds, and do things that are conducive to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.\n(Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China)\nCopyright Thai News Service Group Jul 10, 2020\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country committed to working with the US for non-conflict and mutual respect while safeguarding its sovereignty and development interests.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a major country involved in strategic competition with China, which China urges to discard its Cold-War mentality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CÔTE D'IVOIRE<|>GEO<|>Côte d'Ivoire is a country whose Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly recently passed away, and it has friendly relations with China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMADOU GON COULIBALY<|>PERSON<|>Amadou Gon Coulibaly was the Prime Minister of Côte d'Ivoire, known for his contributions to the development of China-Côte d'Ivoire relations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHAO LIJIAN<|>PERSON<|>Zhao Lijian is a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry who commented on various international relations issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is a country involved in military disengagement talks with China regarding their border issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAKISTAN<|>GEO<|>Pakistan is a country that held a video conference with Chinese experts on COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YAO WEN<|>PERSON<|>Yao Wen is the Deputy Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
