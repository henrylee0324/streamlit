Pesto pasta, made from ingredients she discovered in her cupboards, would make for a flavorful, accessible meal, one her homebound audience could replicate through their computer screens.\nThe Asheville-based Campaign for Southern Equality had invited Chong to lead this free, virtual cooking tutorial for its The Front Porch series of community webinars. The 42-year-old Chong, who serves on the CSE board, had already posted a few meal demonstrations on her Instagram during the coronavirus outbreak. Doing another with CSE seemed like a perfect fit.\n\"To me, cooking is easy,\" said Chong, an executive sous chef with Katie Button Restaurants. \"But when we're stuck at home and some are homeschooling and some have kids, cooking can be very stressful. I like to offer some help to the community.\"\nMinutes before the lesson began on Zoom, a video conferencing platform, Chong received a brief warning from a CSE staff member: \"There may be some people who interrupt the class.\" Chong didn't give the caution much concern.\n  \"No biggie,\" she thought. \"If it happens then we will work through it.\"\nHeld in the afternoon of March 27, the lesson started seamlessly. Chong's wife, Danielle, filmed and CSE staff monitored the Zoom video stream, handling any technical difficulties and booting out any unwelcome guests. Around 10 attendees signed on to watch Chong turn spinach, parmesan, parsley, dill, and some almonds into a thick pesto sauce.\nAbout half an hour into the lesson, after Chong tossed the sauce with cooked penne and was preparing to take audience questions, several new accounts flooded in the video stream.\nChong's first thought: \"Cool, more people are joining.\"\nInstead, the new entrants began spewing a string of slurs toward Chong. Both verbally and on Zoom's chat feature, the intruders got off a torrent of anti-Asian and homophobic epithets before CSE staff scrambled to block off all accounts. While the entire episode lasted around 20 seconds, those listening in said it seemed much longer.\n\"It felt like forever,\" said Al Murray, CSE's director of engagement and organizational development. \"It was infuriating. It was heartbreaking. J is an incredible human and just walks through the world with so much kindness. She is the last person I'd wish this upon.\"\nChong, for her part, remained stoic. \"I am a queer Asian, and those words I've heard all my life,\" she said. \"My wife told me I didn't flinch while it was happening.\"\nWhile few words in a xenophobe's vocabulary can shake Chong, one line uttered during her cooking tutorial was new. Never before had she received the taunt: \"The coronavirus is happening because of you.\"\nAnti-Asian hate in the time of COVID-19\nThe intrusion into J Chong's pesto pasta lesson represented two broad trends of the COVID-19 outbreak: disruptive video chat \"bombings\" and growing incidents - both nationally and locally - of discrimination against Asian- Americans.\nSocial distancing, working from home, and remote schooling have bolstered the prevalence of video conferencing services like Zoom. Yet greater use has been accompanied by an uptick in \"Zoombombings,\" as internet provocateurs around the world coordinate to barge into personal conversations to stir chaos.\nAt physical and online events, CSE staff said they're always on alert for any unwanted guests wishing to protest the organization's pro-LGBTQ messages. Still, the planned interruption of Chong's lesson took the monitors by surprise.\n\"We didn't have any awareness of it,\" Murray said. \"We have been hosting webinars with open attendance processes in the past and haven't seen anything like this happen.\"\nAlongside \"Zoombombings\" many anti-Asian incidents have been reported as some accuse China for the virus's evolution into a global pandemic.\nIn late March, UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University released statements denouncing coronavirus-linked racism against Asians.\nRicky Leung of the advocacy group North Carolina Asian Americans Together said his organization has heard from Asian North Carolinians fearing discrimination. \"We've been getting inquiries about it pretty much since February,\" Leung said. \"People are just kind of concerned.\"'\nNorth Carolina is home to one of the fastest growing Asian American populations in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, no other racial or ethnicity group in the state has grown as quickly since 2010. Asian Americans now make up 3.1% of North Carolina's total population with larger communities in Greensboro, Charlotte, and Raleigh.\nIn Asheville, Calvin Chu, a self-employed entrepreneur, said his Chinese-American ethnicity still makes him unique. \"I stand out wherever it is that I go in Asheville,\" he said.\nIn an April 10 Facebook post, Chu described a recent trip to get his oil changed, revealing his thoughts that the cold, uneasy reactions he perceived from the staff may have had something to do with his ethnicity.\n\"I felt a little bit thrown off and frustrated,\" Chu said.\nJ Chong believes awareness can help diminish misinformation and fear.\n\"I think it's very, very important that people know this is happening to Asian Americans right now,\" said Chong, who is also of Chinese descent. \"All the world is suffering right now. We're all going through this together. It's a global pandemic. It's just very unfortunate right now that Asian Americans are being targeted. So, it's very important we talk about it.\"\nChong's second cooking tutorial\nAfter the CSE monitors banished the \"Zoombombers\", Chong continued the lesson by fielding culinary questions. The returning audience, she said, was supportive and shocked.\nAl Gregory and other CSE staff reg\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>J CHONG<|>PERSON<|>J Chong is an executive sous chef who led a virtual cooking tutorial for the Campaign for Southern Equality and is of Chinese descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAMPAIGN FOR SOUTHERN EQUALITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Campaign for Southern Equality is an organization that promotes LGBTQ rights and hosted a virtual cooking tutorial series called The Front Porch.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIE BUTTON RESTAURANTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Katie Button Restaurants is a culinary establishment where J Chong works as an executive sous chef.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASHEVILLE<|>GEO<|>Asheville is a city in North Carolina where J Chong and the Campaign for Southern Equality are based.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH CAROLINA<|>GEO<|>North Carolina is a state in the United States that has a growing Asian American population and is home to the Campaign for Southern Equality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has led to increased discrimination against Asian Americans and has affected the way people interact, including through virtual platforms like Zoom.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AL MURRAY<|>PERSON<|>Al Murray is the director of engagement and organizational development at the Campaign for Southern Equality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALVIN CHU<|>PERSON<|>Calvin Chu is a self-employed entrepreneur in Asheville who has expressed feelings of being unique due to his Chinese-American ethnicity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNC CHAPEL HILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UNC Chapel Hill is a university that released a statement denouncing coronavirus-linked racism against Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUKE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Duke University is a university that also released a statement denouncing coronavirus-linked racism against Asians.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>J CHONG<|>CAMPAIGN FOR SOUTHERN EQUALITY<|>J Chong led a virtual cooking tutorial for the Campaign for Southern Equality, showcasing her culinary skills and community engagement<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>J CHONG<|>KATIE BUTTON RESTAURANTS<|>J Chong works as an executive sous chef at Katie Button Restaurants, which highlights her culinary expertise<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AL MURRAY<|>CAMPAIGN FOR SOUTHERN EQUALITY<|>Al Murray is the director of engagement and organizational development at the Campaign for Southern Equality, overseeing community initiatives<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CALVIN CHU<|>ASHEVILLE<|>Calvin Chu is a self-employed entrepreneur living in Asheville, contributing to the local community<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNC CHAPEL HILL<|>NORTH CAROLINA<|>UNC Chapel Hill is a university located in North Carolina that addresses issues of racism affecting Asian Americans<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE UNIVERSITY<|>NORTH CAROLINA<|>Duke University is a university in North Carolina that has also addressed racism against Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>NORTH CAROLINA<|>COVID-19 has impacted North Carolina, leading to increased discrimination against Asian Americans in the state<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>J CHONG<|>J Chong's cooking tutorial was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to virtual events and increased discrimination<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
