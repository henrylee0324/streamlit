It was 2 a.m. and the young girl was hours into a fierce fever and a racking cough.\"Mommy, why are my eyes on fire?\" asked Amy Rong.The mother and daughter, along with Rong's parents, live in an 80-square-foot windowless single-room-occupancy Chinatown building that is a home of last resort for many impoverished Asian immigrants. Hallways are cramped, bathrooms and kitchens are communal. A ripe setting for the spread of the highly contagious novel coronavirus.That early March night felt endless. Rong, 42, repeatedly touched Amy's forehead, wondering if her child would die in the small loft that the two shared. Down below, her father slept on the floor while her mother took the lone sofa bed.In the morning, the fever had vanished, only to return a week later. Once again, the family endured a restless night. Rong made soup, but Amy wouldn't eat it.Getting tested for COVID-19 didn't seem like an option for the Rongs. The rumor was that the tests were expensive. Rong also feared the reaction from neighbors.\"If you test positive, everyone would be scared of you,\" said Rong. \"Everyone would think you are the devil.\"It is easy to mistake San Francisco for a thriving Asian American haven. The city, which is its own county, boasts a bustling Chinatown, as well as a popular Japantown. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Vietnamese, Indians and Filipinos also have made their homes here. All told, Asians in San Francisco represent upward of 20 countries.But many Asian American immigrants in the county lead a fragile existence rendered even more precarious with the arrival of COVID-19. So far, 38% of the 123 COVID-19 deaths reported by the San Francisco Department of Public Health are Asian American residents, the most of any ethnicity.Experts also are concerned that positivity rates among Asian Americans in San Francisco could be far higher than the 12% reported, a by-product of the decades-in-the-making model minority myth, which characterizes this ethnic group as financially successful, physically healthy and upwardly mobile. This belief has caused segments of the Asian American community to long be overlooked when it comes to social services for housing, employment and health.San Francisco is one of the few places in the nation tracking data on Asian Americans and COVID-19 deaths at a time when officials don't know the ethnicity of the person affected in nearly half of the nation's 7.8 million coronavirus cases. Around 17 million Americans are of Asian descent, or 5.6% of the population.In many cases, Asian Americans in this city have received imprecise or no information in their native language about testing, safety tips, housing and other critical care services during the pandemic. At the same time, the community is struggling with inadequate access to comprehensive health care, the need to keep front-line employment and growing incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes.\"This model minority thing, that's not us,\" said Judy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps area residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\"There is the language barrier and our community is small,\" Young said. \"So the city doesn't think we have any problems when we do.\"That risk of invisibility is only heightened by the pandemic. Since city health officials do not break down COVID-19 statistics beyond \"Asian American,\" many advocates for the city's various groups said they are left to speculate about coronavirus infection and death rates within their individual communities. How many people are dying, and are those people Japanese Americans? Vietnamese? Filipino?\"There's this feeling that there's excess death out there,\" said Jeffrey Caballero, executive director of the nonprofit Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations. \"That high mortality rate among Asian Americans means either there isn't enough testing or people are waiting far too long to get care.\"What is the model minority myth?For many Asian Americans in San Francisco, the high rate of COVID-19 deaths is directly linked to the corrosive and distorting effects of the model minority myth, said Dr. Tung Nguyen, a University of California, San Francisco professor of medicine.Nguyen co-authored a report in May by the Asian American Research Center on Health that called attention to the fact that 50% of San Francisco's 31 COVID-19 deaths at that time were among Asian Americans, disproportionately high considering they make up just over a third of the population.To be sure, the fortunes and contributions of many Asian Americans have skyrocketed in past decades. The median annual income of households headed by the nation's 22 million Asian Americans is $73,060, compared with $53,600 for all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center.A closer look at San Francisco's two dozen Asian ethnicities reveals many groups within this broad categorization are struggling financially and remain outside the mainstream. About 43% are non-English speakers, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. census data. About a third of San Franciscans are foreign-born, and 13% are not U.S. citizens.\"With Asian Americans, the average always is pulled way up by those doing very well, which means you miss the groups who clearly are not,\" said Margaret Simms, a nonresident fellow with The Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., who specializes in race and labor economics. The think tank found nearly 13% of Asian American senior citizens live in poverty compared to a 9% national average.Discrimination also is keeping some Asian Americans from getting tested for COVID-19. The website Stop AAPI Hate, the acronym for Asian American Pacific Islander, has logged more than 2,500 incidents of discrimination across the U.S. since mid-March\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MANDY RONG<|>PERSON<|>Mandy Rong is a mother concerned about her daughter's health during the COVID-19 pandemic, living in a cramped single-room-occupancy building in Chinatown, San Francisco.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY RONG<|>PERSON<|>Amy Rong is the 12-year-old daughter of Mandy Rong, who experienced severe symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city and county in California known for its diverse Asian American population and significant COVID-19 impact.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHEAST ASIAN DEVELOPMENT CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Southeast Asian Development Center is a nonprofit organization in San Francisco that assists residents from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEFFREY CABALLERO<|>PERSON<|>Jeffrey Caballero is the executive director of the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations, focusing on health issues in the Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TUNG NGUYEN<|>PERSON<|>Dr. Tung Nguyen is a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who has researched the health impacts of COVID-19 on Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSOCIATION OF ASIAN PACIFIC COMMUNITY HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations is a nonprofit that advocates for health issues affecting Asian Pacific communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, significantly impacting health and mortality rates in various communities, including Asian Americans in San Francisco.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDY RONG<|>AMY RONG<|>Mandy Rong is the mother of Amy Rong, who was experiencing health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>COVID-19<|>San Francisco has been significantly affected by COVID-19, with a high percentage of deaths among Asian American residents<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTHEAST ASIAN DEVELOPMENT CENTER<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>The Southeast Asian Development Center operates in San Francisco, providing support to Asian American residents<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEFFREY CABALLERO<|>ASSOCIATION OF ASIAN PACIFIC COMMUNITY HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS<|>Jeffrey Caballero is the executive director of the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations, focusing on health issues in the Asian American community<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TUNG NGUYEN<|>COVID-19<|>Dr. Tung Nguyen has researched the effects of COVID-19 on Asian Americans, highlighting health disparities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEFFREY CABALLERO<|>COVID-19<|>Jeffrey Caballero has expressed concerns about the high mortality rate of COVID-19 among Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TUNG NGUYEN<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Dr. Tung Nguyen's research on COVID-19 mortality rates is focused on the Asian American population in San Francisco<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
