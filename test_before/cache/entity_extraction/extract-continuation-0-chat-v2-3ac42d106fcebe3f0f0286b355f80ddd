I've had other healthcare professionals barging in on me in the\nmiddle of talking with patients and completely ignoring my presence in the room with the patient. I've had patients who asked me to take out\ntheir trash.\"\nMinorities in the healthcare field often have to pay the \"minority tax\" at work, Dr. Marcelin added. That is, they expend extra time and effort\ntrying to combat bias and educate others on the effects of bias, with no compensation for their work.\nMany diseases have been historically examined in male bodies, with the assumption that the same diagnoses would apply to women.\nHeart attacks, for example, can be experienced differently by women, and doctors have misdiagnosed women who've had them. \"Women can\nexperience pain in heart attacks in quite different ways that don't fit what we often think of as the classic heart attack,\" said Dr. Fitzgerald.\nMen are also affected by biases. They are less likely to be diagnosed with mental health issues since they present them differently, said Dr.\nFitzgerald.\nDepressed men may present as angry rather than sad, according to the University of Rochester Medical Center. It is also often harder for men\nwith depression to get help, due to stereotypes of sadness as weakness in men.\nCountries with low rates of obesity have biases against people who are obese.\nBiases against the obese often discount genetic and health factors that affect weight.\n\"Stereotypes against the obese may manifest in a lack of effort to make a connection with the patient, spending less time in clinical\ninteraction and ultimately less investigation of different diagnoses,'\" said Dr. Fitzgerald.\nThough the medical field shares the same biases as the general population, some specialties, like pediatrics, display somewhat lower levels,\nsaid Dr. Fitzgerald.\nA 2008 study found implicit biases in pediatrics to be slightly lower than biases towards adults. The authors cited that further research is\nrequired to assess the effect on quality of care.\nLGBTQ populations experience disparities in physical and mental health outcomes due to biases, according to Dr. Marcelin's research.\n\"Stigma and bias (both conscious and unconscious) projected by medical professionals toward the LGBTQ population play a major role in\nperpetuating these disparities,\" wrote Dr. Marcelin.\nIn the medical field, \"there's a lack of LGBTQ mentorship, poor recognition of scholarship opportunities, and noninclusive or even hostile\ninstitutional climates,\" she wrote.\nDr. Marcelin's research showed that LGBTQ junior physicians did not disclose their sexual identity on residency applications for fear of\nrejection.\nJunior physicians in the field also reported that they did not disclose that they are gay to colleagues and supervisors for fear of rejection or\npoor evaluations.\nThough the US population is relatively diverse, there is a low rate of diversity in the healthcare profession.\nAccording to Dr. Marcelin's research, although the US population is 13% African American and 18% Hispanic, only 3% of full-time medical\nschool faculty is African American and only 4% is Hispanic.\nIn medicine, high rates of diversity lead to excellence in treatment. Reducing biases is everyone's issue, said Dr. Marcelin.\n\"Diversity is better overall for everyone. So what needs to [change] is more white people, especially straight white men, who need to\nembrace the importance of diversity and inclusion and equity. Recognize why it's important to recognize the benefits and put in the effort to\n[make that change],\" said Dr. Marcelin.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DR.
