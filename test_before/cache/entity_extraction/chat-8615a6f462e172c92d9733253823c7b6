Angry. Unsafe.\nThat's how Jasmine Yuan says she felt in March when a stranger in a car yelled “corona!” at her while driving by\nin a grocery store parking lot in North Austin.\nYuan, 39, said she loves Austin and considers it a diverse, multicultural city, but lamented that she now fears\nportions of town that used to be part of her everyday life. After the incident, Yuan said she has avoided public\nplaces that she feels might put her at risk of being targeted again.\n“I feel scared and intimidated. I just don’t want to have this experience happen again,” Yuan said.\nRacist verbal and physical attacks have been reported at growing rates around the country since March,\naccording to people who have started tracking the trend nationally.\nAnd local Asian American community leaders like Hugh Li, president of the education and philanthropy group\nAustin Chinese American Network, fear anti-Asian attitudes tied to the coronavirus pandemic could stick around\nlong after the pandemic and worsen due to waning U.S.-China relations and economic hardship.\n“I think this will naturally put Asian Americans, and particularly Chinese Americans, in a really bad bind,” he\nsaid.\nLi said his organization\nrecently circulated a survey asking its hundreds of members to report incidents of racism they have witnessed\nor experienced during the pandemic, and it has so far have received two reports.\nYuan, who moved to the U.S. 13 years ago and has lived in Austin with her husband and two children since\n2011, responded to the survey. She said she did not immediately report her experience at the grocery store,\nhoping it had been an isolated incident.\n“But if more and more of this happens, this becomes a trend,” Yuan said. “That makes me think that I need to\nstand up and talk about this.”\nAustin resident Jae Kwon, 35, who is Korean American, said he was the target of several aggressions that he\nsuspects were motivated by race.\nKwon, a University of Texas sociology doctoral student who has lived in Austin since 2015, said something was\nthrown at him, a woman screamed something inaudible from a car, and a stranger yelled obscenities at him\nduring a six-day span in May while he was running for exercise. On another occasion, Kwon said a person\nsprayed him with a water gun while driving by.\n“It’s unusual in the sense that things like this had not happened other times,” said Kwon, who also served 12\nyears in the U.S. Navy. “I can only think that these are unrelated incidents, but it’s related in the sense that it\nhappened in this time period.”\nG. Michael Pendon, 43, a local DJ, reported that a group of men harassed him using anti-Chinese and\nhomophobic slurs while he was riding a bicycle through a neighborhood near the UT campus July 18.\nPendon, whose parents came to the U.S. from the Philippines in the 1960s, said he could not sleep that night.\n“I was pissed off. I was tired. I felt like I needed to go down there. I was kind of obsessed about trying to figure\nthis out,” he said.\nAustin police have confirmed that they are investigating the matter. Pendon said he has also spoken to the UT\nPolice Department.\n\"I just want to identify these perpetrators,\" Pendon said.\nResurfacing biases\nExperts in the field of Asian American history say racial violence and tensions during events like a pandemic are\nnot a new phenomenon.\nRussell Jeung, chair of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, said the pandemic has\nreignited old, yet lingering anti-Asian sentiments in the West.\n“There is a historical stereotype on Asians — the yellow peril — that they are a threat that would come dominate\nthe West with their hordes and their diseases,” Jeung said.\nJeung helped start Stop AAPI Hate, an online system in which people across the country can report racially\ncharged incidents against Asian Americans through a form translated into more than 10 languages.\n“We launched it, and immediately we got flooded with responses, and using the data we’ve been sharing it\nwith local jurisdictions,” Jeung said.\nJeung said that, from March 19 through July 1, the organization received more than 2,120 reports of racially\nmotivated attacks against Asian Americans from across the country.\nIn more than 500 cases, Jeung said people reported being told to go back to China. One respondent from\nAustin said they were told to go back to their country by a person who used a racial epithet to describe the\ncoronavirus.\nA relatively small number of cases — 63 incidents — were from Texas, but reports came from every major\nTexas city. About 22% of those reports involved physical attacks, more than double the national rate, Jeung\nsaid. About 63% of reported attacks in Texas were verbal.\nPeople of Chinese descent are not the only segment of the Asian American population targeted since the\npandemic started. On March 14, three people of Burmese descent, including 2- and 6-year-old children, were\nattacked in the West Texas city of Midland by a man with a knife.\nJeung said Trump's rhetoric on China makes Asian Americans more vulnerable to racist attacks.\nAccording to Factba.se, an independent online database of words from Trump’s speeches, media interviews\nand tweets, the president used the term “China Virus” or “Chinese Virus” a total of eight times between\nMarch and April, not including instances in which he blamed China for the pandemic without using those\nterms.\nIn July alone, the database showed that Trump used different variations of the phrase at least 32 times.\n\"Trump makes the connection that the virus\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
