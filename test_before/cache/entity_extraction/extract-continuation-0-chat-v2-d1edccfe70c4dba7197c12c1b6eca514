They don’t speak out. They don’t press charges.\nThey don’t speak English well in some cases,” said Cheng, who is Chinese American.\nThe 48-year-old cancer epidemiologist had just delivered a Christmas gift in late December when a group of\npreteens tackled her to the ground, punched and robbed her. Police believe the same group stomped on an\nAsian woman in her 60s later that night, breaking her kneecap.\n“I can’t walk outside the door of my house and feel safe,” said Cheng, who added that someone called her\n“coronavirus” while she was jogging last March in Oakland. “I just feel like that was taken from me.”\nGun ownership has become a solution for some. David Liu, owner of Arcadia Firearm and Safety in the\npredominantly Asian city of Arcadia, Calif., said his 2020 sales soared four times higher than in a typical year.\nLiu said he saw an uptick in Asian Americans interested in purchasing firearms, but interest has been\nskyrocketing among “basically everybody.”\nNational gun sales are not tracked by race or ethnicity, but in a survey by the National Shooting Sports\nFoundation last year, gun retailers estimated a nearly 43 percent average increase in sales to Asian customers\nin the first half of 2020 — the smallest jump among the four reported racial or ethnic groups. By comparison,\nthe survey estimated an average sales increase of 52 percent to White customers and 58 percent to Black\ncustomers.\nSan Francisco social worker Jason Gee decided to buy a handgun in the spring after a series of incidents that\nincluded an assault, a home invasion and the breaking of his car windows. And on his way to buy the gun, in\nthe parking lot, four White men called him and his friend “the coronavirus” and “c----s.”\nWhile in line to buy the firearm, Gee said, he noticed that most of the customers were also Asian.\nBut he soon started to worry that his purchase was “playing to fear” and ultimately making his community\nless safe, and decided to sell the firearm back.\n“If you show up here . . . expecting violence, that may put you in a certain mind frame where you may\nmisread a situation and respond to it with violence.”\nLocal leaders have made similar pleas, including Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong, who expressed\nconcern about civilian gun owners creating “unintended victims.”\nHe held a news conference on Feb. 16 after a Chinatown shopkeeper was jailed for allegedly firing his weapon\nat a man he believed was robbing a woman on the street. “We don’t want people to fire weapons into our\ncommunity,” he said. “While we appreciated people’s interest in keeping our community safe, we want them\nto observe and report.”\nThat sentiment makes San Francisco gun owner Chris Cheng furious. Cheng, who describes himself as a\nSecond Amendment advocate, has owned a gun since 2008 and said friends and strangers have been\nreaching out to him about gun ownership in response to the attacks.\n“I think a lot of Asian Americans are realizing that the police can only do so much and that the police are not\nalways there to protect us,” Cheng said. “They’re only there to take the report.”\nSome law enforcement agencies have been trying to do more. Police departments in San Francisco and New\nYork City have set up task forces to focus on the issue and increased police presence in predominantly Asian\nneighborhoods.\nThe 25 detectives on the NYPD’s all-Asian task force speak 11 languages among them. In July, when an\n89-year-old woman whose face had been slapped and shirt set on fire didn’t initially cooperate with the\ninvestigation, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, commanding officer of the task force, sent a detective who\nspeaks Cantonese to talk to her.\n“She saw him, and it was like seeing her grandkids or something like that. She opened up,” Loo said. “The\ndetails [she gave] were very precise, very clear. And from that interview, she was able to ID the people\nthat tried lighting her on fire, which led to an arrest.”\nAt least 18 people have been arrested in suspected hate crimes against Asian Americans in New York since\nthe attacks began in 2020, Loo said.\nMany have placed blame for anti-Asian violence on former president Donald Trump, who repeatedly called\nthe coronavirus the “China virus” and “kung flu” during his time in office. The Anti-Defamation League\nfound that anti-Asian sentiment on Twitter spiked after Trump’s October covid-19 diagnosis. Even before\nthat, about a third of Americans in a survey released in April reported witnessing someone blame Asian\npeople for the pandemic.\nBut Rep. Mark Takano (DCalif.) says the problem runs deeper than the former president. During House\nDemocrats’ roundtable discussion on Feb. 19 about the attacks, Takano noted that “this sort of bias is\nlatent throughout American society, and it gets worse or less worse depending on the moment.”\nAs far back as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese laborers from immigrating to the\nUnited States, insidious ideas about Asian people’s influence have fueled racist sentiments in the country.\nThe act was a product of the “yellow peril,” a paranoia that Chinese immigrants were a threat to White\nAmericans’ jobs and other aspects of Western life.\nThese ideas carried into the 20th century, when Chinese American Vincent Chin was fatally beaten in\nDetroit in 1982 after two men allegedly mistook him for Japanese, a group that was being blamed for the\ndecline of U.S. automakers. Chin’s assailants received a fine and probation for his death.\nTensions between\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHENG<|>PERSON<|>Cheng is a Chinese American cancer epidemiologist who has experienced violence and discrimination, including being called \"coronavirus\" while jogging.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVID LIU<|>PERSON<|>David Liu is the owner of Arcadia Firearm and Safety, a firearm retailer in Arcadia, California, who reported a significant increase in sales to Asian Americans in 2020.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JASON GEE<|>PERSON<|>Jason Gee is a San Francisco social worker who decided to buy a handgun after experiencing a series of violent incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LERONNE ARMSTRONG<|>PERSON<|>LeRonne Armstrong is the Oakland Police Chief who expressed concerns about civilian gun ownership and its potential to create unintended victims.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRIS CHENG<|>PERSON<|>Chris Cheng is a San Francisco gun owner and Second Amendment advocate who has owned a gun since 2008 and is concerned about community safety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City has set up task forces to address hate crimes against Asian Americans and increased police presence in Asian neighborhoods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco has implemented measures to increase police presence in predominantly Asian neighborhoods to combat hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Anti-Defamation League is an organization that monitors and reports on anti-Asian sentiment, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARK TAKANO<|>PERSON<|>Mark Takano is a U.S. Representative from California who discussed the deeper societal issues of bias against Asian Americans during a roundtable discussion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former president of the United States who has been blamed for fueling anti-Asian sentiment by referring to COVID-19 using derogatory terms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT<|>EVENT<|>The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was a significant piece of legislation that banned Chinese laborers from immigrating to the United States, reflecting deep-seated racial biases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>PERSON<|>Vincent Chin was a Chinese American who was fatally beaten in 1982, an incident that highlighted racial tensions and violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHENG<|>JASON GEE<|>Both Cheng and Gee have experienced violence and discrimination related to their Asian American identity and have taken steps to address their safety concerns.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVID LIU<|>CHRIS CHENG<|>David Liu's firearm sales increased due to rising interest in gun ownership among Asian Americans, including Chris Cheng.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LERONNE ARMSTRONG<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>LeRonne Armstrong, as Oakland Police Chief, is involved in discussions about community safety in the context of rising violence in the San Francisco area.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRIS CHENG<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Chris Cheng is a gun owner in San Francisco, reflecting the local community's response to safety concerns amid rising violence.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARK TAKANO<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Mark Takano has criticized Donald Trump's rhetoric for exacerbating anti-Asian sentiment in the U.S.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT<|>The Chinese Exclusion Act set a historical precedent for racial violence against Asian Americans, exemplified by the murder of Vincent Chin.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>The Anti-Defamation League has reported on the increase in anti-Asian sentiment linked to Donald Trump's comments during his presidency.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
