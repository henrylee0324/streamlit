Houston\nSt. and pointed a canister at her, the more frightened she felt.\n\"When it first happened, I felt helpless. And as I was walking home ... I was crying because it burned, but\n[because] I was also feeling bullied,\" 30-year-old Kim, a pharmacist and professor who grew up in South Korea,\ntold the Daily News on Thursday.\n\"I tried to downplay it ... I wasn't even going to report it. But I think I am more traumatized than I thought,\"\nshe said. \"It's hard for me to walk down Houston Street ... and whenever I'm on the subway I'm really tense,\nand [have] a panic attack.\"\n\"I feel targeted,\" she continued. \"I wish I didn't feel this [way]. I wish it didn't affect me as much as it has.\"\nKim, who reported the attack to police on Feb. 18, said she did not recognize the passenger who pepper-sprayed her or the driver of the sedan, both of whom she claims were white men in their 20s or 30s.\nThe attack has not yet been ruled a hate crime, though Kim said she has been in close contact with the NYPD\nAsian Hate Crimes Task Force. There have been no arrests.\nThe incident is the latest in a string of random attacks on Asian-Americans across the city.\nPolice have made 18 arrests in 28 incidents of \"COVID-related\" hate crimes against Asians since the start of the\npandemic, though the commanding officer of the task force acknowledged many more incidents have likely gone\nunreported.\nCity officials have responded by directing the 500 additional officers deployed to the subway system to help\ncombat bias, and Mayor de Blasio has vowed to meet with community leaders about the issue.\nYet for Kim, an HIV pharmacist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University and a professor at Touro College\nof Pharmacy, the lingering fear of another unexpected ambush has left her on edge.\n\"As an Asian woman I have experienced racism but not [to] this extent ... I don't think we were expecting this\nkind of hate towards us,\" said Kim. \"Now we are worried about going outside and taking the train and doing\nnormal things.\n\"If there was logic to this, I think it would be easier to solve,\" she said. \"But I don't think there's logic to this\nright now. It's just chaotic.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
