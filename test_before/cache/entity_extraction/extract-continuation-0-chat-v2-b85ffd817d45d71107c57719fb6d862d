The secretary of state referred to it as the Wuhan virus. Florida Sen. Rick Scott has repeatedly referred to it as the Chinese coronavirus.\nCoronavirus, also known as COVID-19, was first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. As the virus infiltrates Tampa Bay, some members of the Asian community say they are feeling the impacts of such rhetoric. Chinese restaurants, in particular, have suffered financial hits. Many Chinese-owned restaurants in the Tampa Bay area reported a sudden and steep drop in sales while other restaurants said they were still experiencing a steady flow of customers.\nSimilar backlashes against Chinese- and Asian-owned restaurants have been reported across the country, most notably in New York City and San Francisco, both places with historic Chinatowns.\nThe events have spurred catastrophic hits in sales, prompting dozens of restaurants to resort to takeout only or shutter completely.\nPeter Chen, who owns China Yuan in Tampa, said his business began dropping about 10 days ago, a few days after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Florida.\nAll the business at Asian restaurants is dropping, Chen said. The last 10 days weve dropped 30 to 40 percent. Chens family has run the Cantonese-style restaurant on N Armenia Avenue for 15 years. While the recent dip in sales has hurt, Chen said he and his family members will take a pay cut if necessary to float the business.\nWe just have to make enough to pay our employees, he said. I have some money saved, but when your (sales) drop 50 percent or more, you can make it maybe one month\nmore. Longer? No way. People have to realize this isnt just in China anymore its the world.\nAt Liangs Bistro in New Tampa, general manager Jason David said business began declining the same day the first positive case of the coronavirus was reported.\nThe owners are Chinese, he said. The cooks are Chinese. We have a lot of regulars that know this and there were a lot of phone calls that day asking if we were getting our meats and seafood from China, David said. I think I got maybe 12 calls in one day.\nDavid said that while the restaurants in-house business has dropped 10 to 20 percent, the takeout business has stayed about the same.\nWe havent hit pandemonium yet, and hopefully we wont.\nBeyond the immediate business impact, Sam Obeid, program director for Community Tampa Bay, said the rhetoric could have a harmful impact on perpetuating stereotypes. Its especially true under the guidance of social distancing, a term used by public health officials to discourage close contact between people in an effort to curb the spread of disease.\nChoosing to add stereotypes to an already stereotyped community is breeding new racism or adding to existing racism, Obeid said. We need to be living and surviving this in the spirit of community more than anything else.\nIn the weeks following the initial outbreak, accounts of racist comments were shared on Twitter and the hashtags #IAmNotAVirus and #JeNeSuis PasUnVirus in France began trending. Reports of a Singaporean man attacked on a London subway and accounts of racial profiling were shared on social media.\nMichelle Phan, a makeup artist, YouTube personality and founder of Ipsy who grew up in Tampa and is of Vietnamese heritage, responded on Twitter to the racist comments on her Instagram account and YouTube videos. People told her to to go back to eating bats and accused Asians of starting diseases.\nId like remind the people whove been racist towards Asians because of the coronavirus, she wrote. 90% of everything you own was made in China including your phone. Bye.\nA letter from a member of the Greater Orlando Chinese Professional Society to Scott calling his words offensive and discriminative made its way through WeChat circles, dividing many in the Tampa Chinese community who did not support the message or wish to sign the letter.\nWei Xue, A Chinese-American Tampa resident, said protesting terminology only served to further divide people.\nAt this critical moment, I think its unacceptable to confuse or cause fights just between parties or for political reasons, she said. The majority of us come here, we work hard, we know this country gave us opportunities and freedom, so we love this country.\nXue, who has lived in the U.S. for the past 27 years, considers herself American but still has family in China and was filled with worry when she first heard about the outbreak in Wuhan. The response she found from her community here was uplifting. The downturn in Chinese restaurant business isnt racist, Xue said, but a byproduct of people not wishing to go into any crowded public space.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises fighting stigma by communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups.\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council has called for a fight against racism and the director general of the World Health Organization advised against discrimination and stigma.\nCenters for Disease Control director Robert Redfield said it was wrong to refer to COVID-19 as Chinese coronavirus.\nScotts office said the senator, who has been self-quarantined after coming into contact with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaros press secretary Fabio Wajngarten, stands by his terminology and called it a sad propaganda campaign from the Chinese Community Party to call it otherwise.\nThe virus originated in China, Chris Hartline, Scotts communications director, said in an email statement. The Chinese Communist Party lied about the virus. They lied about the numbers. They silenced critics and doctors who were raising red flags (one of the first doctors to warn about the virus subsequently died from it). They sacrificed their own people to try to prevent a PR problem. And the result was that the virus was allowed to spread further and quicker around the world.\nDonna McGill, executive director of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus, is a global pandemic that originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and has led to significant health and economic impacts worldwide.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN CITY<|>GEO<|>Wuhan City is the location in Hubei Province, China, where COVID-19 was first identified.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUBEI PROVINCE<|>GEO<|>Hubei Province is a province in China where Wuhan City is located and where the COVID-19 outbreak began.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMPA BAY<|>GEO<|>Tampa Bay is a region in Florida that has experienced impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly affecting local Asian-owned businesses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is a major city in the United States that has reported similar backlashes against Asian-owned restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is another major city in the United States with a historic Chinatown that has faced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETER CHEN<|>PERSON<|>Peter Chen is the owner of China Yuan, a Chinese restaurant in Tampa, who reported a significant drop in business due to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIANG'S BISTRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Liang's Bistro is a Chinese restaurant in New Tampa that has experienced a decline in business following the COVID-19 outbreak.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JASON DAVID<|>PERSON<|>Jason David is the general manager of Liang's Bistro, who noted a decline in business due to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAM OBEID<|>PERSON<|>Sam Obeid is the program director for Community Tampa Bay, who commented on the harmful impact of rhetoric related to COVID-19 on stereotypes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICHELLE PHAN<|>PERSON<|>Michelle Phan is a makeup artist and YouTube personality who responded to racist comments related to COVID-19 on social media.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREATER ORLANDO CHINESE PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Greater Orlando Chinese Professional Society is a community organization that addressed offensive terminology used regarding COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEI XUE<|>PERSON<|>Wei Xue is a Chinese-American resident of Tampa who expressed concerns about the divisive nature of protests against terminology related to COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a national public health agency that advises against stigma related to COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization is an international public health agency that has called for a fight against racism and discrimination related to COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>WUHAN CITY<|>COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan City, marking the beginning of the pandemic<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>TAMPA BAY<|>COVID-19 has impacted businesses in the Tampa Bay area, particularly Asian-owned restaurants<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>COVID-19 has led to similar backlashes against Asian-owned restaurants in New York City<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>COVID-19 has affected Asian-owned restaurants in San Francisco, similar to other cities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETER CHEN<|>LIANG'S BISTRO<|>Peter Chen's restaurant, China Yuan, and Liang's Bistro both experienced declines in business due to COVID-19<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JASON DAVID<|>LIANG'S BISTRO<|>Jason David is the general manager of Liang's Bistro, which has seen a decline in business due to COVID-19<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAM OBEID<|>COVID-19<|>Sam Obeid commented on the harmful impact of COVID-19-related rhetoric on stereotypes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHELLE PHAN<|>COVID-19<|>Michelle Phan responded to racist comments related to COVID-19, highlighting the impact on the Asian community<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREATER ORLANDO CHINESE PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY<|>COVID-19<|>The Greater Orlando Chinese Professional Society addressed offensive terminology related to COVID-19<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEI XUE<|>COVID-19<|>Wei Xue expressed concerns about the divisive nature of protests against terminology related to COVID-19<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<|>COVID-19<|>The CDC advises against stigma related to COVID-19<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>COVID-19<|>The WHO has called for a fight against racism and discrimination related to COVID-19<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
