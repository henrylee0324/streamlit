It's happening among weary Filipino nurses in Queens, Hmong refugee families in\nMinneapolis and in Silicon Valley's Asian American community.\nAs school buildings start to reopen, Asian and Asian American families are choosing to keep their children\nlearning from home at disproportionately high rates. They say they are worried about elderly parents in\ncramped, multigenerational households, distrustful of promised safety measures and afraid their children will\nface racist harassment at school. On the flip side, some are pleased with online learning and see no reason to\nrisk the health of their family.\nIn New York City, Asian American children make up the smallest share of children back in classrooms - just\nunder 12 percent - even though they represent 18 percent of all students. In Tennessee, less than half of Asian\nfamilies enrolled in Metro Nashville Public Schools opted for in-person learning, compared with nearly two-thirds\nof White children.\nIn Chicago, two-thirds of White students chose in-person learning, while just a third of Asian, Black and Latino\nstudents decided to head back. And in Fairfax County Public Schools, the largest district in Virginia, just over 30\npercent of Asian families selected face-to-face instruction this spring, by far the smallest return rate reported\namong any racial group.\nThe academic consequences could be devastating, warned Mya Baker of education nonprofit TNTP, which works\nwith school districts across the country to boost achievement among low-income and minority students. This is\nespecially true in communities of immigrant and refugee Asian families, she said, who are often overlooked due\nto the pervasiveness of the \"model minority myth.\"\nIn reality, many Asian communities face the same kinds of challenges that hold back Black and Latino students,\nincluding poverty, language barriers and under-resourced schools. In New York City, more than 1 in 5 Asians live\nin poverty, the second highest of any racial or ethnic group, according to city data.\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, nearly 30 percent of Asians in the United States live in intergenerational\nhouseholds, almost double the percentage of White households. And Asian Americans represent the most\neconomically divided racial group in the nation, with the success of the affluent obscuring the plight of the least\nfortunate.\n\"Everyone makes assumptions that, 'Oh, Asian kids are doing better with virtual learning,' \" Baker said. \"The\nreality is we're talking about families living in multigenerational households, families where English is not spoken\nat home, so we're increasing barriers for those students who are already not performing well.\"\nBaker said that is why it is essential for schools to work doubly hard to reach Asian families - about a third of\nAsians in the United States have limited English proficiency - and to reassure them that their children will not be\ntargeted.\nIn Virginia and Maryland, Asian American students seem to be suffering smaller academic losses than their\nBlack and Latino classmates. But in other places, like Minneapolis, where the Southeast Asian refugee\ncommunity faces steep rates of poverty, students appear to be losing ground as fast or even faster than other\nstudents of color. In fall 2019, about 7 percent of grades given to Asian students were F's. That percentage\nmore than quadrupled - to 30 percent - in the fall of 2020, according to the Sahan Journal, which reports on\nMinneasota's immigrant communities.\nAnxiety about being targeted\nMany Asian Americans have been anxious of being targeted after President Donald Trump used racist language\nto describe the coronavirus. Critics warned his repeated use of phrases like \"Chinese virus\" and \"kung flu\" could\nescalate attacks on Asian Americans, who reported rising instances of harassment. Now, a spate of high-profile\nattacks on Asian Americans has many in the community on edge.\nIn New York City, a Filipino man was slashed with a box cutter on the subway, an Asian woman was punched in\nthe face on a subway platform, and another woman was shoved to the ground in Flushing, a predominantly\nAsian community in Queens. In Los Angeles, a man at a bus stop was beaten with his own cane, and a Thai\ngrandfather died after being pushed to the ground in San Francisco. It's unclear whether race motivated all the\ncrimes, but the incidents, combined with increasing reports of harassment and bullying, have heightened\nanxiety in many communities.\nThe ripple effects among families weighing whether to send their children back are far-reaching.\nIn New York City, Liz OuYang, a Columbia University adjunct professor and civil rights attorney who specializes\nin combating hate crimes, said some Asian American families are fearful about setting foot outside their homes.\nOuYang, who directs an annual hate crime prevention art project for the nonprofit OCA-NY Asian Pacific American Advocates, said parents and kids have shared stories of strangers harassing them, yelling at them\nto \"speak English\" or \"go back to your home country.\"\nIt has made some families fearful of sending their children on solo commutes to school. So instead, they keep\nthem home, learning remotely.\nIn New York City's Chinatown, a school principal said one mother moved her child from in-person learning to\nremote learning after she and her child were harassed on the subway. Some families are so worried about\nleaving their apartments that the school has shelled out funds to ship or hand-deliver supplies and packets to\nthem.\nParents have relayed the same fears in Philadelphia. Anna Perng, co-founder of the Chinatown Disability\nAdvocacy Project, said parents reported their children were being harassed on city buses. Then, over the\nsummer, police arrested a homeless\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
