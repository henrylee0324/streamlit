Some families are so worried about\nleaving their apartments that the school has shelled out funds to ship or hand-deliver supplies and packets to\nthem.\nParents have relayed the same fears in Philadelphia. Anna Perng, co-founder of the Chinatown Disability\nAdvocacy Project, said parents reported their children were being harassed on city buses. Then, over the\nsummer, police arrested a homeless woman for attacking a pregnant woman in Chinatown, calling her a slur\nand punching her in the face.\nThat sent the anxiety in Philadelphia's Asian American communities into overdrive, Perng said, and now\nthreatens to deprive them of access to school-provided resources they badly need.\n\"Families have told me they're afraid to go to the school district to get things like worksheets, learning\nsupplies and the free meals the school district has been handing out since the pandemic started,\" Perng said.\nLisa Liu, whose two children attend Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland, said she saw little reason\nto send them back to classrooms when virtual learning seemed to be working well for them. But fear that\nthey would face harassment also played into her decision.\n\"Maybe if they go back, the other kids will say, 'You're the reason we didn't go to school for a year,' \" Liu said.\n\"I don't want my kids to experience hatred.\"\nMany in medical fields\nBut it is not just harassment that families worry about. Asian Americans are overrepresented in medical\nfields, making up 6 percent of the population but 18 percent of the nation's doctors and 10 percent of its\nnurse practitioners. It means they are more likely to have had firsthand experience with the virus.\nSuzanne Lirazan, a 30-year-old nurse from the Philippines who lives in Queens, has seen the devastation of\nthe pandemic firsthand. She works as a private nurse, and in April the patient she was caring for fell ill after\ncontracting the coronavirus. She was at his bedside as he took his final breaths. Then she and the rest of the\nhousehold fell ill. She was unable to see her 9-year-old son, Gabriel De La Cruz, for an entire month as she\nrecovered and quarantined.\nLirazan worries her son could bring home the virus from school, a prospect that would not only be dangerous\nfor her, but for her patients, too.\n\"It's the fear of him getting sick, and transmission-wise, I don't want to get sick and transmit it with my\npatients,\" Lirazan said. \"My son, he's very social, he likes to study in school. But I just can't bring myself to\nbring him there.\"\nLirazan said that sentiment is common in Filipino communities in New York and New Jersey, where many work\nin health-care in jobs that put them in close contact with patients.\nPreexisting conditions\nFor Nancy Lin, a Philadelphia mother of two who was laid off from her restaurant job when the pandemic\nstruck, the decision to keep her children remote was driven by something else: the school building. According to her dispatches with other parents over the messaging app WeChat, many other Chinese families are\nmaking the same decision.\nThey had complaints about the condition of the school even before the pandemic, of mold in the basement,\nthat bathrooms were dirty, and that heating and cooling systems were not in working order. They are the\nsame factors that are keeping other families of color - and teachers - out of school buildings.\nTheir concerns are not unfounded. An investigative series in 2017 by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily\nNews found widespread issues with asbestos and paint laced with lead. When the teachers union pushed\nthe school system to delay the start date of in-person classes, its leader cited the district's \"absolutely\nabysmal track record when it comes to addressing health and safety.\"\nAt Hmong International Academy in Minneapolis, Principal Jamil Payton said only a third of students in\nprekindergarten through fifth grade have come back to the school building since they reopened last month.\nThe school serves a mix of students from the city's refugee communities - Hmong, Laotian, Cambodian and\nSudanese students. There were fewer than 100 students in the building the last week of February, a group\nwhose demographics roughly matched the school's.\nThe Hmong community has been hard-hit by the coronavirus. In June, Marny Xiong, a Hmong woman who\nchaired of the St. Paul Board of Education, succumbed to the virus at the age of 31, devastating the\nHmong community. Xiong had worked as an administrator at Hmong International Academy and her loss\nwas felt deeply.\n\"We were hit like a ton of bricks by the passing of this staff member who was so beloved in our building\nand our community,\" Payton said. He believes it is contributing to the reluctance of Hmong families to send\ntheir children back to school buildings.\nSwapping information\nThe decision for almost any family to send their children back to school can be wrenching, as they attempt\nto balance the benefits of sending their children back to school with the risks - all while the death toll from\nthe pandemic mounts. So many are relying on parents from their own communities, swapping information\nin group chats to make decisions.\nMehvish Ali, who is Pakistani American, had a lot to weigh when trying to decide whether to send her two\nsons back to school in Loudoun County, a Northern Virginia suburb. Her oldest son, a seventh-grader, was\neager to get back to school to see his friends. But he also has a medical condition that makes him\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
