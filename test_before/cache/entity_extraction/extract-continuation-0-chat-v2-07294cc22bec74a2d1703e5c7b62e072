If he sees someone look at him, or talking on the phone\nand look at him, he thinks they're talking about him,\" 26-year-old Montaser told the Daily News on Sunday. \"We did\neverything we could for him. ... He's always in trouble.\"\nThe stabbing incident is one of the latest in a series of random attacks on Asian-Americans across the city.\nPolice have made 18 arrests in 28 incidents of \"COVID-related\" hate crimes against Asians since the start of the\npandemic, though the commanding officer of the NYPD Asian Hate Crimes Task Force acknowledged many more incidents have likely gone unreported.\nMuflehi was charged Saturday with attempted murder, two counts of assault and criminal possession of a weapon,\nofficials said.\nYet the wife of the 36-year-old victim, who asked that her name not be used, says she still hasn't ruled out the\npossibility that the stabbing was racially motivated.\n\"I'm torn about this being a hate crime. ... Why would he attack an Asian man in Chinatown at this time?\" she told\nThe News, referring to the recent string of attacks. \"Even a mentally ill person can commit a hate crime.\"\nMuflehi first showed signs he was struggling with mental health issues at age 17, around the time he moved to New\nYork from Yemen, his family said. He later went back to Yemen, where his health seemed to improve - but began to\nunravel again when he returned to New York.\n\"When he came back home ... maybe [for] a month or two months [he was] good. Then he flipped,\" said Montaser.\nMuflehi was charged with assault in September 2019 for throwing a bottle that struck Montaser in the head, police\nsaid.\n\"He gets mad so fast,\" Montaser said, recalling the incident.\nMontaser said his sibling received mental health help while behind bars, and he appeared to improve while on\nprescription drugs.\n\"He gave him some medication, the doctor, and he became a normal guy,\" Montaser said. \"For four, five, six months\nhe was nice and quiet, he was really a completely different person.\"\nBut it didn't take long for Muflehi take another dark turn. On Jan. 12 he allegedly punched a 28-year-old man in the\nhead inside a Sunset Park deli, knocking him to the ground .\n\"He just came up behind me and hit me. I said 'I think you have the wrong dude, I don't even know you,' \" said the\nvictim, who asked that his name not be used.\n\"He said I looked at him wrong. I was talking on the phone when I walked in and he said I was talking about him.\"\n\"I think that guy just has anger issues and is out there to hurt people,\" said the victim, who got a restraining order\nagainst Muflehi. \"He said I want to go get a knife to stab you.\"\nMuflehi's mother, Safia Saeed, had heard her son make similar threats in recent years.\n\"He'd say, 'I want to kill you, I want to kill myself,' \" Saeed, 63, told The News in Arabic.\n\"We tried to take him to the doctor and he said no.\"\n\"He's got no mind,\" she added with a sullen look as she tapped the top of her head. \"He needs help.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SALMAN MUFLEHI<|>PERSON<|>Salman Muflehi is a 23-year-old accused attacker with a history of violence and mental illness, charged with stabbing a man in Chinatown, Manhattan.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONTASER MUFLEHI<|>PERSON<|>Montaser Muflehi is the brother of Salman Muflehi, who has expressed concern about his brother's mental health and violent behavior.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in Manhattan where the stabbing incident involving Salman Muflehi occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is the city where Salman Muflehi moved from Yemen and where he has been involved in multiple violent incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YEMEN<|>GEO<|>Yemen is the country from which Salman Muflehi emigrated to New York and where he reportedly showed signs of improved mental health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNSET PARK<|>GEO<|>Sunset Park is a neighborhood in Brooklyn where Salman Muflehi was previously charged with assaulting another man.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAILY NEWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Daily News is a newspaper that reported on the stabbing incident and the background of Salman Muflehi.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NYPD ASIAN HATE CRIMES TASK FORCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The NYPD Asian Hate Crimes Task Force is a police unit that acknowledged a rise in hate crimes against Asians during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAFEIA SAEED<|>PERSON<|>Safia Saeed is the mother of Salman Muflehi, who has expressed concern about her son's mental health and violent tendencies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICTIM<|>PERSON<|>The 36-year-old victim of the stabbing incident in Chinatown, whose name has not been disclosed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATTEMPTED MURDER<|>EVENT<|>Salman Muflehi was charged with attempted murder following the stabbing incident in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALMAN MUFLEHI<|>MONTASER MUFLEHI<|>Montaser Muflehi is the brother of Salman Muflehi and has expressed concern about his brother's mental health and violent behavior.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALMAN MUFLEHI<|>VICTIM<|>Salman Muflehi is accused of stabbing the 36-year-old victim in Chinatown, leading to serious injuries.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALMAN MUFLEHI<|>SUNSET PARK<|>Salman Muflehi was previously charged with assaulting another man in Sunset Park, indicating a pattern of violent behavior.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALMAN MUFLEHI<|>NEW YORK<|>Salman Muflehi moved to New York from Yemen, where he has been involved in multiple violent incidents.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALMAN MUFLEHI<|>YEMEN<|>Salman Muflehi emigrated from Yemen to New York, where he has struggled with mental health issues.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONTASER MUFLEHI<|>SALMAN MUFLEHI<|>Montaser Muflehi has been vocal about his brother's mental health struggles and violent tendencies.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAFEIA SAEED<|>SALMAN MUFLEHI<|>Safia Saeed is the mother of Salman Muflehi and has expressed concern about her son's mental health and violent behavior.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NYPD ASIAN HATE CRIMES TASK FORCE<|>CHINATOWN<|>The NYPD Asian Hate Crimes Task Force is involved in addressing the rise of hate crimes, including the stabbing incident in Chinatown.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAILY NEWS<|>SALMAN MUFLEHI<|>The Daily News reported on the stabbing incident involving Salman Muflehi and his background.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTIM<|>CHINATOWN<|>The victim was attacked in Chinatown, where the stabbing incident occurred.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
