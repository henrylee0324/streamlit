Though the\norganization has not yet received any local reports, Executive Director Hailey Easley said she believes the tool\nwill be useful in tracking racism well after the pandemic.\n“I actually see this opening up,” Easley said. “I imagine that this could be helpful beyond COVID-19, and it\ncould be helpful for people of all ethnicities and all races.”\nLocal response\nAmy Wong Mok, an established activist in the local Asian community, has been informing Mayor Steve Adler\nand Austin Police Chief Brian Manley about racist incidents she has heard about.\nhomophobic slurs while he was riding a bicycle through a neighborhood near the UT campus July 18.\nPendon, whose parents came to the U.S. from the Philippines in the 1960s, said he could not sleep that\nnight.\n“I was pissed off. I was tired. I felt like I needed to go down there. I was kind of obsessed about trying\nto figure this out,” he said.\nAustin police have confirmed that they are investigating the matter. Pendon said he has also spoken to\nthe UT Police Department.\n\"I just want to identify these perpetrators,\" Pendon said.\nResurfacing biases\nExperts in the field of Asian American history say racial violence and tensions during events like a\npandemic are not a new phenomenon.\nRussell Jeung, chair of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, said the pandemic has\nreignited old, yet lingering anti-Asian sentiments in the West.\n“There is a historical stereotype on Asians — the yellow peril — that they are a threat that would come\ndominate the West with their hordes and their diseases,” Jeung said.\nJeung helped start Stop AAPI Hate, an online system in which people across the country can report\nracially charged incidents against Asian Americans through a form translated into more than 10\nlanguages.\n“We launched it, and immediately we got flooded with responses, and using the data we’ve been sharing\nit with local jurisdictions,” Jeung said.\nJeung said that, from March 19 through July 1, the organization received more than 2,120 reports of\nracially motivated attacks against Asian Americans from across the country.\nIn more than 500 cases, Jeung said people reported being told to go back to China. One respondent\nfrom Austin said they were told to go back to their country by a person who used a racial epithet to\ndescribe the coronavirus.\nA relatively small number of cases — 63 incidents — were from Texas, but reports came from every\nmajor Texas city. About 22% of those reports involved physical attacks, more than double the national\nrate, Jeung said. About 63% of reported attacks in Texas were verbal.\nPeople of Chinese descent are not the only segment of the Asian American population targeted since the\npandemic started. On March 14, three people of Burmese descent, including 2- and 6-year-old children,\nwere attacked in the West Texas city of Midland by a man with a knife.\nJeung said Trump's rhetoric on China makes Asian Americans more vulnerable to racist attacks.\nAccording to Factba.se, an independent online database of words from Trump’s speeches, media\ninterviews and tweets, the president used the term “China Virus” or “Chinese Virus” a total of eight\ntimes between March and April, not including instances in which he blamed China for the pandemic\nwithout using those terms.\nIn July alone, the database showed that Trump used different variations of the phrase at least 32 times.\n\"Trump makes the connection that the virus is Chinese, but he also normalizes the hate,\" Jeung said.\nJeung said the news media's framing of discussions and depictions of the pandemic, especially in its\nearly days, also has eroded the image of the Asian community in the country.\nIn addition to referring to the pathogen as the “Wuhan Virus,” many news organizations frequently\nran clips and images of people of East Asian descent wearing face masks, Jeung said.\n“We all have implicit biases, and we have fight or flight responses,” Jeung said. “During the pandemic\npeople are fearful, and when they’re fearful, they automatically respond.”\nA local group called the Austin Asian Community Health Initiative in May started a reporting system\nfor pandemic-related racist aggressions, and is working with Austin Public Health to track the data.\nThough the organization has not yet received any local reports, Executive Director Hailey Easley said\nshe believes the tool will be useful in tracking racism well after the pandemic\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the President of the United States who used terms like \"China Virus\" and \"Chinese Virus\" in his speeches, contributing to anti-Asian sentiments during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTIN ASIAN COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A local group that started a reporting system for pandemic-related racist aggressions and is working with Austin Public Health to track data on these incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAILEY EASLEY<|>PERSON<|>Hailey Easley is the Executive Director of the Austin Asian Community Health Initiative, advocating for tracking racism related to the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RACIST ATTACKS<|>EVENT<|>Racist attacks against Asian Americans that have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, fueled by rhetoric and media framing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An online system created to report racially charged incidents against Asian Americans, which received over 2,120 reports of such incidents during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>PERSON<|>Russell Jeung is the chair of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, addressing anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTIN<|>GEO<|>Austin is a city in Texas where reports of racist incidents against Asian Americans have been documented during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEXAS<|>GEO<|>Texas is a state in the U.S. where reports of racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans have been recorded, including incidents in major cities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUMP<|>RACIST ATTACKS<|>Trump's rhetoric normalizes hate and contributes to the vulnerability of Asian Americans to racist attacks during the pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAILEY EASLEY<|>AUSTIN ASIAN COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVE<|>Hailey Easley leads the Austin Asian Community Health Initiative, which is focused on addressing and tracking racist incidents<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Russell Jeung co-founded Stop AAPI Hate to address and report incidents of anti-Asian violence during the pandemic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTIN ASIAN COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVE<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The Austin Asian Community Health Initiative collaborates with Stop AAPI Hate to track and report incidents of racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTIN<|>TEXAS<|>Austin is a city within Texas where incidents of racist attacks against Asian Americans have been reported<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RACIST ATTACKS<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Stop AAPI Hate received reports of racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans, highlighting the increase in such incidents<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
