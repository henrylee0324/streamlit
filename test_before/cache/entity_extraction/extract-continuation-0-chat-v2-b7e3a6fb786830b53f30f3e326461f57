The website Stop AAPI Hate, the acronym for Asian American Pacific Islander, has logged more than 2,500 incidents of discrimination across the U.S. since mid-March, from verbal assaults to acts of physical violence.Decades of racist policiesChinese citizens began passing through San Francisco's then bridgeless Golden Gate en masse during the Gold Rush of 1849. By the late 1800s, the Chinese were not just vilified but outright barred from the country, with few exceptions, by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. White officials charged they were taking jobs from other Americans, despite having been integral to the Gold Rush's boom and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad.At the height of World War II, Japanese Americans around the country were rounded up and sent to internment camps, feared as the traitorous \"yellow peril\" after years of citizenship. Despite painful and humiliating treatment at the hands of the U.S. government, many Asians resolved to ingrain themselves in the society at large with an image of themselves as patriotic, hardworking Americans.The model minority image gained momentum during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Asian American success stories were highlighted by white U.S. officials both as a way of signaling to other nations, namely the Soviet Union, that America was not racist, but also to shame other ethnic groups, notably Black Americans.Then came the Vietnam War, a quagmire that resulted in a U.S.-sponsored evacuation of 125,000 refugees followed by countless others who escaped in rickety boats. Many landed in San Francisco.California Assembly member David Chiu, a Democrat who represents the eastern half of San Francisco and chairs the California Asian & Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, said lawmakers must recognize that Asian Americans are a loosely linked group of immigrants with distinct challenges and needs.\"The attention being paid to the disparities endured during the pandemic by Black and Latinos is important, but our issue hasn't gotten the attention it deserves,\" he said.A COVID-19 information gapAsian American communities in San Francisco speak a range of languages including Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Laotian, Samoan, Tongan, Vietnamese, and Hindi. The city's website notes that COVID-19 information is available in English, Chinese, Filipino, and Spanish.Efforts by city health officials to inform Asian residents about COVID-19 safety precautions and testing in their native languages have sometimes resulted in confusing or alienating translations. For example, information about pop-up virus testing sites sometimes can come across as demands, while in other cases the language is just plain confusing.No end in sightRong never found out whether her daughter had COVID-19. But her days remain filled with dread. For the past few months, the family has had little money for food or rent.Rong doesn't know anyone who has contracted the virus. For her neighbors in the building, getting tested remains a common fear.Mostly, Rong waits for the day when the pandemic is over. For a day when it will feel safe to venture outside. For a day when her American dream can resume.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that tracks incidents of discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the U.S., logging over 2,500 incidents since mid-March.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DAVID CHIU<|>PERSON<|>David Chiu is a California Assembly member and Democrat who represents the eastern half of San Francisco and chairs the California Asian & Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California known for its diverse Asian American communities and historical significance during the Gold Rush and the Vietnam War.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has significantly impacted communities, including Asian Americans, leading to discrimination and health disparities.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT<|>EVENT<|>The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was a federal law that prohibited Chinese laborers from entering the United States, reflecting the racial discrimination of the time.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>VIETNAM WAR<|>EVENT<|>The Vietnam War was a conflict that led to the U.S.-sponsored evacuation of 125,000 refugees, many of whom settled in San Francisco.)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVID CHIU<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>David Chiu advocates for the recognition of the challenges faced by Asian Americans, which aligns with the mission of Stop AAPI Hate to address discrimination against this community.<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>San Francisco is a city where Stop AAPI Hate operates and tracks incidents of discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased discrimination against Asian Americans, which Stop AAPI Hate is actively tracking and addressing.<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>COVID-19<|>San Francisco has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting its diverse communities, including Asian Americans.<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>The Chinese Exclusion Act historically affected Chinese immigrants in San Francisco, leading to discrimination and exclusion from society.<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>VIETNAM WAR<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>The Vietnam War resulted in a significant influx of refugees to San Francisco, shaping the city's demographic and cultural landscape.<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
