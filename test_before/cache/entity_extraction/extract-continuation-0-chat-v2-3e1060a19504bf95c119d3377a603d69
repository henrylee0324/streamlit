many coughed at and spat upon - because the coronavirus originated in China.\nA gun-store owner in Los Angeles County - home to the largest population of Asians in the United States at 1.5 million - told The Straits Times he has seen a surge in Asian customers in recent months, many of them first-time buyers.\nThere are certainly compelling reasons for Asian Americans to be fearful these days.\nA Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) analysis, obtained by ABC News, \"assesses that hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the US... based on the assumption that a portion of the US public will associate Covid-19 with China and Asian-American populations\".\nAt a Texas supermarket last month, a man stabbed a Chinese-American family, including children aged two and six, because he thought the family was infecting people with the virus.\nHundreds of news reports about similar incidents this year prompted Dr Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, to set up an online reporting centre for personal accounts of such experiences.\nLaunched on March 19 with the help of two California-based advocacy groups - the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council, and Chinese for Affirmative Action - the Stop AAPI Hate website (www.a3pcon.org/stopaapihate) has amassed more than 1,000 reports, or about 100 a day, as of March 30.\n\"On a political level, we need to document what's going on,\" Dr Jeung explains.\n\"And track trends so we can have appropriate interventions at the community or policy level.\"\nAnd the initiative offers guidance for those who submit stories, \"like what to do when your kid is bullied or you face workplace discrimination\". Some striking trends are emerging from the submissions.\nNOT AN ABSTRACTION\nI was waiting at a grocery store when an older white woman wearing a mask shouted a profanity at me, pulled off her mask and theatrically coughed in my direction. I was the only non-white person in the line. I think we've reached that point where (Asians) are no longer feeling this as an abstraction.\nMR JEFF YANG, a Taiwanese-American journalist and author who recently tweeted about an encounter and got a flood of responses about similar experiences.\nDREAD AND STRESS\nMy wife got coughed at a park, and my son and I were shunned at a sporting goods store; it was a small incident but it was noticeable. Like a lot of Asian Americans, we're now hyper aware of how people perceive us. And it just adds to the dread and stress over the upcoming surge of cases and deaths from the disease itself.\nDR RUSSELL JEUNG, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, who set up an online reporting centre - the Stop AAPI Hate website - for personal accounts of such experiences.\nAlmost 90 per cent cite \"race\" as the reason for discrimination, with two-thirds of incidents involving verbal harassment. Three times more women than men have filed reports, and only 40 per cent of victims are Chinese.\nOther Asian ethnicities, or \"anybody who looks Chinese\", can be targeted too, says Dr Jeung.\nSifting through these accounts has been \"harrowing and depressing\", he admits. Those who write in speak of being called names, having bottles thrown at them and Uber drivers refusing to pick them up.\n\"It's been hard to see how much hate there is and how virulent people's prejudices are,\" says the professor. And the bigotry, he believes, has not been helped by US President Donald Trump, who \"insisted on calling it 'the Chinese virus'\".\nThe identities of those who write in are kept confidential, but Dr Jeung, who is Chinese American, shares that he, his Korean-American wife and their son have experienced discrimination too.\n\"My wife got coughed at a park, and my son and I were shunned at a sporting goods store; it was a small incident but it was noticeable,\" says the 57-year-old.\n\"Like a lot of Asian Americans, we're now hyper aware of how people perceive us. And it just adds to the dread and stress over the upcoming surge of cases and deaths from the disease itself.\"\nOther Asian Americans feel the same.\nMs Kristine Villanueva, a Filipino American in Washington DC, had an ugly experience a month ago.\nThe 26-year-old editor for a non-profit news organisation was returning to her apartment when a stranger began yelling at her.\nThe African-American man followed her inside and \"asked our concierge why she was talking to me, and kept calling me 'a dirty b***h with the flu'\" before he was asked to leave.\nMr Jeff Yang, a Taiwanese-American journalist and author, recently tweeted about an encounter of his own and got a flood of responses about similar experiences.\n\"I was waiting at a grocery store when an older white woman wearing a mask shouted a profanity at me, pulled off her mask and theatrically coughed in my direction.\n\"I was the only non-white person in the line.\"\n\"I think we've reached that point where (Asians) are no longer feeling this as an abstraction,\" says the 52-year-old.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an online reporting center for personal accounts of discrimination against Asian Americans, launched to document hate incidents and provide guidance for victims.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR RUSSELL JEUNG<|>PERSON<|>Dr. Russell Jeung is a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University and the founder of the Stop AAPI Hate website.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC PLANNING AND POLICY COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council is one of the advocacy groups that helped launch the Stop AAPI Hate website.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action is an advocacy group that collaborated in the establishment of the Stop AAPI Hate website.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles County is home to the largest population of Asians in the United States, with a significant Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR JEFF YANG<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Jeff Yang is a Taiwanese-American journalist and author who has shared his experiences of discrimination and has engaged with the community through social media.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISTINE VILLANUEVA<|>PERSON<|>Ms. Kristine Villanueva is a Filipino American editor for a non-profit news organization who experienced discrimination in Washington DC.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is the pandemic that has led to increased discrimination and hate crimes against Asian Americans, as it originated in China.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DR RUSSELL JEUNG<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Dr. Russell Jeung founded the Stop AAPI Hate website to document hate incidents against Asian Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC PLANNING AND POLICY COUNCIL<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council helped launch the Stop AAPI Hate website<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action collaborated in the establishment of the Stop AAPI Hate website<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES COUNTY<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Los Angeles County has a significant Asian American population that is affected by the issues documented by Stop AAPI Hate<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MR JEFF YANG<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Mr. Jeff Yang has shared his experiences related to the discrimination documented by Stop AAPI Hate<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISTINE VILLANUEVA<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Kristine Villanueva's experiences of discrimination are part of the reports collected by Stop AAPI Hate<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The rise in hate incidents against Asian Americans is linked to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
