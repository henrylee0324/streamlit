Physical assaults make up 9% of these incidents, while potential civil rights violations,\nsuch as workplace discrimination, made up 8% of these incidents, according to the center's website.\nThe resolution states: \"The Monterey County Board of Supervisors, on behalf of the County and all residents\nthereof, denounce hate crimes, hateful rhetoric and hateful acts against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,\nand reaffirm our commitment to ensure that API Americans feel safe and welcome, both during this COVID-19\npandemic and beyond.\"\nRecent attacks were reported in Oakland and San Francisco, not far from Monterey County.\nOn Jan. 30, 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee died after he was attacked while walking in San Francisco. The\nincident was deemed a hate crime. On Jan. 31, three elderly Asian Americans were assaulted in Oakland's\nChinatown District.\nJeff Uchida, who is a part of the Japanese American Citizens League of Monterey Peninsula, thanked the board\nfor being early in taking a stand in California, noting that people must work together to prevent any more\nviolence and racism in Monterey County.\n\"We've seen some of the videos of the horrendous attacks against Asian Americans that have occurred, but we\nneed to have leaders step forward and truly denounce just the terribleness and how it affects our communities,\"\nUchida said.\nA county clerk will send copies of the resolution to Gov. Gavin Newsom, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne\nFeinstein and other elected officials.\nSupervisor Luis Alejo also noted that Feb. 19 was the Day of Remembrance for Executive Order 9066, which\nordered the imprisonment of over 120,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II.\n\"It's important to be proactive, to not forget the lessons of the past and teach our youth these lessons and\nthese important messages that we stand united,\" he said. \"I think as elected officials, we send a strong\nmessage throughout the county that these [incidents] are unacceptable.\"\nSupervisor Mary Adams said she has friends who were sent to the internment camps during World War II,\nincluding one who was born there.\n\"That it even existed is such a scar on our entire country,\" Adams said. \"I think it's really important for us to\nhave the opportunity to think about those things specifically at times like this when the possibility of similar\ncrimes happening again is just horrendous.\"\nIn January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order condemning the attacks and criticizing federal officials\nwho referred to the pandemic as the \"China virus\" or the \"Kung flu.\" The order called for better data collection\nabout hateful incidents.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
