No, you don't deserve this because you're human.\"\nBeing a front-line worker didn't help Li - and when she texted her colleagues to warn them before they left work, one of them responded with her own story of being harassed\njust a week earlier.\nGem Manalo, a Mass General anesthesiology resident who is of Chinese and Filipino descent, was riding the \"T,\" as the subway is called in Boston, across the river to Cambridge\nfor a yoga class in early March when she said a man starting yelling: \"F--- China! F--- the Chinese!\"\n\"I was too scared to look at him,\" said Manalo, 29. A stranger recorded the incident with her phone and assured Manalo that she would defend her if the man tried to physically\nharm her.\n\"He kept saying things like: 'You people eat bats! Watch my YouTube channel tonight, and I'll tell the real story.' He kept saying: 'F--- China. F--- the Chinese,' over and over,\"\nManalo said.\n\"Here I am in the hospital, working in all these makeshift ICUs,\" Manalo said. \"We're all at a loss, too, trying to come up with new protocols to keep everybody safe, and this\nguy is telling me that I am terrible.\"\nAudrey Li, an internal-medicine resident at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who plans to specialize in infectious diseases, said she was repeatedly told by a\nfrustrated patient at another hospital to \"go back to your country.\"\nLi, who was born in New Jersey to Chinese immigrant parents, was too shocked to respond and immediately wondered if she had done something wrong. But a white intern told\nthe patient that her comments were unacceptable.\n\"Part of the unsettling piece of racism is you're never sure if it's something you as an individual did or if it's something that's immutable and larger than yourself,\" said Li, 28.\n\"There was a sense of a little bit of guilt and shame for having forgotten what it was like to be marginalized in that way.\"\nIn Los Angeles County, Hengky Lim, a 44-year-old nurse practitioner from Indonesia, said he approached an ER patient who had a fever and a cough to show him how to put on\na mask one night in March. The patient yelled at him and coughed in his face, spit splattering on his plastic face shield. \"You know where coronavirus is from? It's from you\npeople! I don't want to be seen by you,\" Lim recalled the patient shouting. Then the patient walked out of the ER.\nIn April, when Lim, dressed in a hazmat suit, was treating patients with covid-19 symptoms in a tent outside the main hospital, he said a man who had chest pain, difficulty\nbreathing and a persistent cough declined Lim's assistance and returned to see the nurse who had taken his vitals. That nurse, who was white, later told Lim that the patient\nsaid he did not want to be seen by an Asian provider because he thought he had contracted the coronavirus from a Chinese man coughing near him at a store, Lim recalled.\n\"I asked the nurse, 'Are you sure it was a Chinese man?' It's just stereotyping, assuming everyone who is Asian is Chinese and has coronavirus,\" Lim said. He tried to treat the\npatient anyway, telling him that he was his only choice and that he would take care of him. But the man left after spitting into a cup for the coronavirus test - and did not bother\ngetting the X-ray or EKG that Lim had ordered for him.\nLim said he had never before encountered such discrimination during his 10 years in nursing, but it has become such a common experience among his Asian colleagues that he\nthought about quitting.\n\"Everybody is scared. I'm putting myself out there only to be treated this way. It's very disheartening,\" he said. \"We're not sick. You're the one who is sick, which is why you are\nhere. And you are exposing us as the health-care provider taking care of you, and we are treated as though we are the ones carrying the coronavirus.\"\nThis spring in Seattle, Amy Zhang was wearing scrubs, walking to her 13-hour night shift as an anesthesiology resident, when a man began cursing at her a block away from\nthe hospital.\n\"F--- you, China, for giving us smallpox,\" the man shouted at Zhang, the 29-year-old Chinese American doctor recalled. He followed her and continued yelling racial epithets.\nZhang said the encounter shook her, affecting her ability to focus on her work at the start of her shift. \"I was not in the best state of mind to help out with patient care,\" she\nsaid.\nAnd in Southern California, Audrey Sue Cruz, an internal-medicine doctor in Loma Linda, was conducting a telephone visit with a new patient recently when, 15 minutes into the\nappointment, the woman began grilling the physician on her medical education, work history and ethnicity.\nCruz told the patient that she is Filipina, to which she said the patient replied: \"Wow. I can't believe what your people did. I usually wouldn't choose an Asian doctor, but you\nseem nice.\"\nCruz quickly ended the visit. The incident inspired her to join more than a dozen other doctors in producing an #iamnotavirus video to help combat the wave of bigotry against\nAsians.\n\"We wanted to use our voices as physicians to remove the stigma that's occurring right now about Asian people being virus carriers,\" said Cruz, 30.\nShe posted the video on Instagram. Then came the comments: \"Bat eater.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
