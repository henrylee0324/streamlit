Many other economies, such as the European Union,\nhave effectively flattened, even lowered the curve after suffering a heavy blow. Yet the world's only superpower\ncontinues to set single-day records - it registered more than 60,000 new cases on Tuesday.\nThat's why US politicians have intensified their attacks against China, often using racist language, in campaign rallies, on TV and social media, in a bid to deflect public criticism.\nSadly, resorting to such racist rhetoric is regarded as a good strategy by some Republicans to appeal to the\nvoters. The fact that many supporters in campaign rallies cheered the leaders who used racist language should\nshock the world, especially after worldwide anti-racism protests sparked by the death of African American\nGeorge Floyd due to police brutality in Minnesota on May 25.\nThe racist slurs relished by top US officials are also partly responsible for the increasing discrimination and\nattacks against Asian Americans. A Pew survey released on July 1 showed that about four in 10 US adults say it\nhas become more common for people to express racist views against Asians since the pandemic broke out.\nHowever, the condemnation of such racist language against Asian Americans is more muted than during the\nrecent Black Lives Matter movement. Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser with a track record of hate\nspeech against China, has frequently used lies and racist language in his interviews with US media outlets lately,\nbut he has often gone unchecked and unchallenged. Which speaks volumes of how media outlets sometimes,\nintentionally and unintentionally, spread racism.\nMSNBC host Ali Velshi set a good example by quickly contesting Navarro who was peddling his conspiracy theory\nlast Saturday on a program saying China \"spawned the virus\" and \"they hid the virus. They sent hundreds of\nthousands of Chinese nationals over here to seed and spread the virus before we knew\". Velshi was quick to\nquestion Navarro: \"What are you talking about?\"\nAnd in reply to the US president's tweet on Monday that \"China has caused great damage to the United States\nand the rest of the World!\", I tweeted that the whole world knows how incompetent and anti-science he has\nbeen in his response to the outbreak. The tweet received more than half a million views and has been quoted by\nseveral news outlets.\nThose US politicians may not stop using xenophobia and racism to advance their political agenda, but at least\nsane people across the world should speak out more forcefully against such hate rhetoric, so as to not become\ntheir accomplices.\nThe author is chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels.\nchenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn\nCredit: Chen Weihua\nCopyright China Daily Jul 11, 2020\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>US PRESIDENT<|>PERSON<|>The US president is a political leader who has been criticized for using racist language and deflecting attention from the administration's pandemic response.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country that has been blamed by US politicians for the COVID-19 pandemic, often using racist rhetoric.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN UNION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Union is a political and economic union of member states that has effectively managed the pandemic response compared to the US.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>PERSON<|>George Floyd was an African American whose death due to police brutality sparked worldwide anti-racism protests.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETER NAVARRO<|>PERSON<|>Peter Navarro is a White House trade adviser known for his use of hate speech against China and promoting conspiracy theories.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALI VELSHI<|>PERSON<|>Ali Velshi is a host on MSNBC who challenged Peter Navarro's claims regarding the origins of the coronavirus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to millions of cases and deaths, significantly impacting the US and the world.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA DAILY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>China Daily is a media outlet that published the article discussing the US president's rhetoric and the impact of racism during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRUSSELS<|>GEO<|>Brussels is the capital of Belgium and the location of the China Daily EU Bureau.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US PRESIDENT<|>CHINA<|>The US president has used racist language to blame China for the COVID-19 pandemic, deflecting criticism from his administration's response.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN UNION<|>US PRESIDENT<|>The European Union has been contrasted with the US president's handling of the pandemic, highlighting differences in response effectiveness.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>US PRESIDENT<|>The death of George Floyd sparked anti-racism protests, which are relevant to the context of the US president's use of racist language.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETER NAVARRO<|>US PRESIDENT<|>Peter Navarro, as a White House adviser, supports the US president's narrative against China, often using racist language.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALI VELSHI<|>PETER NAVARRO<|>Ali Velshi challenged Peter Navarro's claims about the coronavirus, representing a counter-narrative to the US administration's rhetoric.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>US PRESIDENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is central to the US president's political strategy and rhetoric, particularly in the context of blame towards China.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA DAILY<|>US PRESIDENT<|>China Daily published an article criticizing the US president's use of racist language and his handling of the pandemic.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRUSSELS<|>CHINA DAILY<|>Brussels is the location of the China Daily EU Bureau, where the author of the article is based.<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
