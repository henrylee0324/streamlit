The synthetic rubber is used to make wetsuits and laptop cases, and the emissions from the production process\nare so harmful that the EPA lists the predominantly Black neighborhood next door to the plant as having the highest risk of cancer in the entire country. In September, St. John the Baptist Parish had the 27th highest\ndeath rate from COVID-19 in the nation, according to a USA TODAY analysis.\nThe Rev. Lionel Murphy of the Tchoupitoulas Chapel, which sits 2 miles from the chloroprene plant, has counseled many Black families over the years as they've come down with diabetes, respiratory illnesses and rare\ncancers. Now, he's seeing his neighbors die from COVID-19.\n\"People get sick, people die, you go bury them,\" Murphy said. \"But there's no fight to erase the problem.\"\nHealth care missing when needed\nIn McKinley County, New Mexico, many local residents struggle to find health care.\nYear after year, Congress has failed to allocate enough money to fulfill its legal obligation to provide health care to Indigenous tribes, including the Navajo, Hopi and Zuni people who make up the majority of McKinley\nCounty's population.\nA 2018 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights titled \"Broken Promises\" found the federal government spends nearly four times as much on health per person through government programs than it spends for\neach Indigenous person.\nThat helps explain why McKinley County has the nation's sixth-highest death rate from COVID-19, according to USA TODAY data, with more than 240 people dying in the isolated corner of the state.\nAnna Marie Rondon, executive director of the New Mexico Social Justice and Equity Institute in McKinley County (who is Diné, as the Navajo people call themselves), said the ravages of COVID-19 are not an isolated\ntragedy but the latest chapter in Indigenous people's long history of abuse and neglect from the U.S. government.\nOn the Navajo Nation, inadequate resources have resulted in widespread water poverty, food insecurity and high rates of illness. These daily realities were devastating long before the pandemic, but they've also helped\nfuel a high COVID-19 death rate.\n\"It's really an unbelievable chain of oppression – it's still squeezing us, it still has its grip,\" Rondon said. \"And it's still killing us.\"\nFood deserts make people vulnerable\nIn California, Imperial Valley is considered the nation's winter breadbasket, producing 80% of the country's fresh vegetables during the cold months. But the predominantly Hispanic workers who pick alfalfa, lettuce,\nsugar beets and carrots can rarely afford to buy them.\nNearly 75% of adults and 13% of children are obese or overweight for their age, according to state data. On the other end of the spectrum, 31% of kids in Imperial County don't get enough to eat each day, according\nto a 2018 report by Feeding America, a national anti-hunger organization based in Washington, D.C.\n\"If they're already on food stamps, to spend the extra money to get fruits and vegetables, it's expensive,\" said Jessica Solorio, executive director of Spread the Love, a local food bank.\nThose figures show why COVID-19 has been so fatal in the county, with 16 deaths per 10,000, nearly three times the national average, according to the USA TODAY analysis.\nCultural barriers complicate response\nIn San Francisco, community activists are worried that the number of Asian Americans getting COVID-19 is being vastly underreported.\nOf the county's nearly 12,000 positive test results, only 12% are Asian American, yet Asian Americans have made up 38% of the death count. Experts attribute that alarming disconnect to a number of factors, including\nthe fear of losing a job after a positive test, language barriers, lack of health care, growing anti-Asian hate crimes, and what's called the \"model-minority myth\" – an assumption that education and financial successes\nenjoyed by some Asian Americans apply to all 20-some Asian ethnicities.\nJudy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a nonprofit that helps residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, said her community suffers from an average household income a quarter\nof the city's average, low high school graduation rates and obstacles to health care. Add a COVID-19 testing regime tailored to those proficient in English and an often fatalistic attitude toward the pandemic in the\ncommunity, and Young said the virus has been painful to the Asian American community.\n\"I've asked our clients why they're not getting tested,\" she said. \"Often the reaction I get is, 'I'm going to die anyway, and if I test positive, then I can't go to work.\"\n'We become invisible'\nAsk Beverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, why so many people of color across the U.S. are dying from COVID-19 and she goes back 400 years to the arrival of the first\nenslaved Africans to colonial U.S. shores.\nRacism is so entrenched in the American way of life, she said, that it's impossible to separate the high death rates of marginalized communities from the nation's historic treatment of each of them. From the broken\npromises of reparations to the terrible treatment of immigrants, from redlining practices that excluded Black Americans from homeownership to the GI Bill money that went mostly to white service members returning\nfrom World War II, Wright says\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ST.
