That being said, going back to work also creates a challenging dilemma for some workers: If you’re going back to work on a reduced schedule (with reduced pay), this part-time work can result in your UI benefits being either denied or reduced.\nAnd, of course, there’s still ongoing safety concerns for workers around COVID-19, as well as childcare issues for working parents.\nQ: The brief shows how an increasing number of people are getting denied unemployment because of partial income. Is there a minimum people can earn before they’re cut off from unemployment or is it based on percentage reduction of your usual income?\nWhen you file for unemployment insurance, EDD (The division which handles Unemployment Insurance) takes a look at your earnings history, and determines a weekly benefit amount, which is the maximum you can be paid in benefits each week.\nFor claimants whose amount is below the cap of $450, they can typically earn up to 75% of their prior average weekly earnings. If they earn more than that in a given week, they aren’t eligible for any benefits. But it’s week by week, so if they earn less in the next week, then they could be eligible to receive unemployment again.\nQ: Your findings show one in four women, as opposed to one in five men, are affected by the crisis. Why are women impacted so much more?\nSome of this, though not all, can be explained by the nature of the crisis: We’ve seen that several of the industries hardest hit by the pandemic are often the ones where more women tend to work. In particular, women make up a disproportionate share of the labor force employed in accommodation, food services and sales, industries hit especially hard by the shutdowns.\nQ: I’ve heard from a lot of people that they’re making more in unemployment than working because of the extra $600 federal unemployment assistance. So should people go back to work if they can?\nA: Generally speaking, yes, the Unemployment Insurance system in the U.S. is structured in such a way as to encourage people to go back to work because you’ll make more money.\nThat being said, policymakers created the $600 FPUC payment because they recognized the unique circumstances created by the COVID-19 crisis and all of the social distancing challenges it created, especially for the labor market.\nWhile earning a bit of extra money during the shutdown helps many workers, the $600 payment is set to expire next month, and hence workers may return to work when they can since the risk of being unemployed and uninsured again in July may outweigh the benefits of a few weeks of extra cash now.\nQ: The report suggests a program like work sharing could help workers. How does it work?\nA: Work sharing programs allow firms to avoid layoffs by instead reducing hours for a group of employees. For these employees, a portion of their lost pay is replaced with prorated UI benefits. Importantly, for companies re-opening at reduced hours, work sharing allows some employees who would otherwise earn too much money in a week to remain eligible for partial UI, to instead receive these benefits, and also receive the $600 weekly FPUC payment.\nQ: What else could be done to help workers and/or business owners who have been hit so hard because of this pandemic?\nA: The $600 FPUC payments are a lifeline for many workers. Even with these payments, the median weekly benefit amount for initial claimants in California is just above 50% of median family income in the state. Without these additional payments, many families out of work would be facing even more severe income shocks, which will have repercussions throughout the economy as they’re forced to further reduce spending.\nTying such benefits to a meaningful economic trigger as opposed to an arbitrary calendar date should be a high priority.\nQ: Anything I didn’t ask or you want to add?\nA: The report also finds that close to 80% of workers who filed unemployment insurance benefits during the crisis could have received a payment. The typical UI claimant could have been paid within two weeks of filing benefits. While this may not have been true for every claimant, overall it seems the system was able to provide support for unemployed workers in a timely fashion!\nIn California is a roundup of news from across USA TODAY Network newsrooms.
