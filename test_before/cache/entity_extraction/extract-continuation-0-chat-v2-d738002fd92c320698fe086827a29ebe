(The vast majority of cases are in China.) There have been at least 11 reported deaths in the US so far. But the disease isn't the only thing spreading.\nMany Americans are already dealing with another kind of flare-up: xenophobia and racism. There have been reports of blatant verbal and physical attacks around the world, from men trying to push a woman off her bike in the Netherlands, to a man in London being punched and kicked as he walked down the street. But what's impacting thousands more people of Asian descent are microaggressions, or indirect expressions of intolerance.\nIn general, microaggressions are common. A recent survey by Glassdoor of 1,100 US employees found that 61% had witnessed or experienced workplace discrimination based on age, race, gender, or LGBTQ identity. Add into the mix fear, rumors, and misinformation about a deadly, contagious disease, and the results are grim.\nAlthough microaggressions can be subtle, their effects are real. Research published in the US National Library of Medicine from 2015 of 405 young adults of color found that experiencing microaggressions increased incidence of depression and suicidal ideation.\nUnfortunately, I didn't have to look any further than my colleagues to find examples of racism and xenophobia in recent weeks.\nBryan Pietsch, an editorial fellow at Business Insider who's Korean-American, got on the subway in Brooklyn Thursday morning. As soon as he boarded, a middle-aged woman covered her mouth, glared at him, and then moved away.\n\"Her obviously covering her face and shooting me a dirty look just because I was standing near her made me feel disappointed,\" Pietsch said. \"It did make me concerned about how other people were interpreting the situation. If they saw her doing that, did that make them more concerned about my presence in the crowded car?\"\nEmily Park, an animation fellow at Business Insider who's Korean-American, was on the subway in Manhattan on Monday when she cleared her throat. A woman stared at her for several moments and then promptly got up and moved seats farther away.\n\"I'd heard of other Asian people experiencing something like this, but I hadn't yet, so it just felt kinda bad,\" Park said.\nAlana Yzola, a senior producer at Business Insider, said she was recently in an Uber driving through Flushing, when her driver locked the doors and said \"there are a lot of Chinese here, you have to be careful,\" apparently referring to catching the coronavirus, which they had been discussing. Uber is investigating the incident.\nJennifer Hernandez, a customer success specialist at Business Insider, was getting off the PATH train from New Jersey to New York City and boarding an elevator when, she said, she witnessed a troubling interaction. She was on the elevator with 3 white males and one woman of Asian descent, all of them apparently strangers. The 3 men started talking about the coronavirus, with one commenting about how the spread was likely related to \"all the disgusting food Chinese people eat.\" The Asian woman became visibly uncomfortable and upset, Hernandez said, eventually speaking up and defending Chinese food and culture.\nMicroaggressions toward people of Asian descent are becoming more common nationwide in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. A woman in South San Francisco sneezed into her elbow in a hallway in a hospital, where she was getting a flu shot, when a middle-aged white woman yelled a racist slur at her, NPR reported. Kids in Ontario thought it would be fun to play a game of testing one of their Asian peers for coronavirus, TIME reported. Some parents in Melbourne refused to let Asian doctors at one hospital treat their kids. Across France, the hashtag \"#JeNeSuisPasUnVirus\" or \"I am not a virus\" has gained traction in response to a slew of racist comments and attacks. A similar hashtag, \"#NoSoyUnVirus\" has taken off in Spain.\nRacism and xenophobia spreads with infectious diseases\nWhat is it about the rise of an infectious disease that makes for the spread of xenophobia or racism? Josue David Cisneros, professor at University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, has studied this phenomenon.\n\"It is not surprising that a new disease leads to public fear, stigma, and the scapegoating of certain kinds of people because we tend to understand these events through our past disease rhetoric, which is rooted in fear, stigma, scapegoating,\" Cisneros told Business Insider.\n\"Some of the US' first immigration laws were targeting Chinese immigrants because they were seen as racial, cultural, and biological threats, for example the Chinese Exclusion Act,\" Cisneros said. \"Perceived biological threat is tied to a perceived cultural threat.\"\nA recent example is President Trump's 2018 speech where he said undocumented immigrants \"infest\" the US. Cisneros added that anti-Chinese rhetoric, in particular, dates back to the 19th century, and has continued even as recently as the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the swine flu outbreak of 2009.\nLehigh University researchers found, for example, that media coverage of the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is a city in China where the novel coronavirus first emerged in December 2019)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is the country where the coronavirus outbreak began and has been significantly affected by the virus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOSUE DAVID CISNEROS<|>PERSON<|>Josue David Cisneros is a professor at the University of Illinois who studies the link between racism and disease)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Illinois is an educational institution where Josue David Cisneros conducts his research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS INSIDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Business Insider is a media organization that reported on the experiences of its employees regarding microaggressions during the coronavirus outbreak)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRYAN PIETSCH<|>PERSON<|>Bryan Pietsch is an editorial fellow at Business Insider who experienced a microaggression on the subway in Brooklyn)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMILY PARK<|>PERSON<|>Emily Park is an animation fellow at Business Insider who experienced a microaggression on the subway in Manhattan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALANA YZOLA<|>PERSON<|>Alana Yzola is a senior producer at Business Insider who reported an incident with her Uber driver regarding the coronavirus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENNIFER HERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Jennifer Hernandez is a customer success specialist at Business Insider who witnessed a troubling interaction on the PATH train)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLUSHING<|>GEO<|>Flushing is a neighborhood in New York City where Alana Yzola had an incident with her Uber driver)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is a major city in the United States where Jennifer Hernandez witnessed a troubling interaction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONTARIO<|>GEO<|>Ontario is a region where kids played a game testing an Asian peer for coronavirus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MELBOURNE<|>GEO<|>Melbourne is a city in Australia where some parents refused to let Asian doctors treat their kids)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>France is a country where the hashtag \"#JeNeSuisPasUnVirus\" gained traction in response to racist comments and attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPAIN<|>GEO<|>Spain is a country where the hashtag \"#NoSoyUnVirus\" has taken off in response to racism during the coronavirus outbreak)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WUHAN<|>CHINA<|>Wuhan is a city in China where the coronavirus outbreak began<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOSUE DAVID CISNEROS<|>UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS<|>Josue David Cisneros is a professor at the University of Illinois<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRYAN PIETSCH<|>BUSINESS INSIDER<|>Bryan Pietsch is an employee of Business Insider who reported experiencing a microaggression<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMILY PARK<|>BUSINESS INSIDER<|>Emily Park is an employee of Business Insider who reported experiencing a microaggression<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALANA YZOLA<|>BUSINESS INSIDER<|>Alana Yzola is an employee of Business Insider who reported an incident with her Uber driver<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JENNIFER HERNANDEZ<|>BUSINESS INSIDER<|>Jennifer Hernandez is an employee of Business Insider who witnessed a troubling interaction<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLUSHING<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>Flushing is a neighborhood in New York City where Alana Yzola had an incident<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ONTARIO<|>MICROAGGRESSIONS<|>Kids in Ontario played a game testing an Asian peer for coronavirus, reflecting microaggressions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MELBOURNE<|>MICROAGGRESSIONS<|>In Melbourne, some parents refused to let Asian doctors treat their kids, reflecting microaggressions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>MICROAGGRESSIONS<|>In France, the hashtag \"#JeNeSuisPasUnVirus\" reflects the rise of microaggressions during the coronavirus outbreak<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPAIN<|>MICROAGGRESSIONS<|>In Spain, the hashtag \"#NoSoyUnVirus\" reflects the rise of microaggressions during the coronavirus outbreak<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
