[Trump frequently calls the cause of the spreading illness known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a \"China virus\" or a \"Chinese virus.\"]\nFauci: Ever.\nQuestion: And you never will, will you?\nFauci: No.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has urged against referring to the novel coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus,\" particularly as Asian Americans have reported instances of discrimination and public harassment as the virus spreads in the US.\nRobert Redfield, the director of the CDC, earlier this month said it is \"absolutely wrong and inappropriate\" to call COVID-19 the \"Chinese coronavirus.\"\nMoreover, the CDC's website states: \"People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine...Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.\"\nCOVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, originated in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government has been broadly criticized for suppressing information on the spread of the virus, particularly early on. But it's also taken measures that have seemingly been successful in slowing the rate of new infections.\nIn January, Trump praised China's response to the novel coronavirus, but he's shifted to blaming China for the global spread while referring to it as the \"Chinese virus.\"\nTrump on January 24:\n—Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020\nTrump on March 19:\n—Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 19, 2020\nMeanwhile, Fauci, a public health hero who's led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for over 30 years, has emerged as one of the most trusted voices in the US amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut as coronavirus has spread acrosss the US, Fauci has had to walk a very fine line between keeping the public informed and calm, and not angering a president with a history of lashing out at aides and officials who are seen as undermining him.\nWith that said, Trump has a tendency to embellish or spread outright false information, which can be dangerous during a pandemic. On more than one occasion, Fauci has stepped up and contradicted or corrected statements made by the president.\n   https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345 1/2\n%\n6/24/2021 https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345\nAddressing the difficulty of this in the Science Insider interview, Fauci said: \"I can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down. OK, he said it. Let's try and get it corrected for the next time.\"\nWhen Fauci didn't appear at one of the White House's daily press briefings on the coronavirus response last week, it raised alarm bells that he'd been sidelined for being too honest and embarrassing a president with an aversion to facts.\nIn a separate interview with the New York Times, published on Saturday, Fauci said his straightforward style of talking is a \"risky business.\"\n\"I say it the way it is, and if he's gonna get pissed off, he's gonna get pissed off. Thankfully, he is not. Interestingly,\" Fauci said, referring to Trump.\n\"I don't want to embarrass him,\" Fauci added. \"I don't want to act like a tough guy, like I stood up to the president. I just want to get the facts out. And instead of saying, 'You're wrong,' all you need to do is continually talk about what the data are and what the evidence is.\"\nFauci said Trump \"gets that\" and \"takes it in a good way,\" calling him a \"smart guy.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the President of the United States who has referred to the novel coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus\" and has been criticized for his handling of the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTHONY FAUCI<|>PERSON<|>Dr. Anthony Fauci is the top expert on infectious disease in the US and has publicly opposed the term \"Chinese virus\" to describe the novel coronavirus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The CDC is a national public health institute in the US that has advised against using the term \"Chinese virus\" due to concerns about discrimination against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, and has led to a global pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is a city in China where the novel coronavirus is believed to have originated.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ANTHONY FAUCI<|>Donald Trump and Anthony Fauci have had a contentious relationship regarding the public messaging about the coronavirus pandemic.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTHONY FAUCI<|>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<|>Anthony Fauci's statements align with the CDC's guidance against using the term \"Chinese virus\" to prevent stigma.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<|>Donald Trump has publicly contradicted the CDC's recommendations regarding the terminology for the coronavirus.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>WUHAN<|>COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, making the city significant in the context of the pandemic.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>COVID-19<|>Donald Trump has referred to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus,\" which has been a point of controversy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTHONY FAUCI<|>COVID-19<|>Anthony Fauci has been a leading voice in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and correcting misinformation.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
