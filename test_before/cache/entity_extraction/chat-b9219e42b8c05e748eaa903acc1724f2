The move has been welcomed by advocacy groups as \"a promising\nstep\".\nThe executive order, one of four addressing racial equity, directs the Department of Health and Human Services\nand the COVID-19 health equity task force to issue guidance on cultural competency, language access and\nsensitivity.\nIt also directs the Department of Justice to engage with the Asian American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI,\ncommunity on issues related to hate crimes, hate incidents and harassment.\n\"The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments\nthrough the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic\nlocation of its origin,\" reads the executive order.\n\"Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific\nIslanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI\npersons.\"\nThe executive order \"sends a powerful message to the AAPI community that the Biden administration is\ncommitted to addressing racial injustice\", said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative\nAction. \"Specifically, the executive order disavowing discrimination against the AAPI community is a promising\nstep in recognizing the harm done to the AAPI community.\"\nWave of attacks\nSince the start of the pandemic, Asian Americans have experienced a wave of racist attacks and harassment.\nMore than 2,800 people reported incidents of racism and discrimination targeting Asian Americans across the USbetween March 19 and Dec 31, 2020, according to Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition aimed at addressing pandemic-\nrelated racism.Former president Donald Trump and his Republican allies are accused of purposely calling COVID-19 the \"China\nvirus\" in an effort to blame China for the pandemic.\nAccording to Stop AAPI's research, there have been at least 46 racial attacks in which Trump was actively\ninvoked, and Trump is \"the greatest spreader\" among politicians of anti-Asian-American rhetoric related to the\npandemic.\nThe research also found his racist or stigmatizing tweets have by far the greatest reach and were retweeted\nover 1.2 million times in the first eight months of last year.\n\"Calling the coronavirus 'China virus' is racist, hurtful, fake information, unscientific, and without basis. Yet it\ninflamed racist attacks and harassment against Chinese Americans throughout the US,\" said Lillian Sing, a\nretired judge in San Francisco.\nHer grandson Logan was a victim. The 18-year-old high school senior was born and raised in Pennsylvania and\nhad never experienced discrimination until recently in a soccer game, said Sing. The incident happened when he\nwas in the restroom, where one player said to the other players: \"Let's get out ... a Chinese who spreads\ncoronavirus.\"\nLogan's story isn't an isolated one. A study by the Stop AAPI Hate Youth Campaign found one in four young\nAsian Americans have experienced a form of anti-Asian hatred.\n\"Asian Americans are suffering from more racial attacks and harassments than ever before. In scientific,\nbusiness, political, academic and government circles,\" said Sing.\nAccording to the White House, Biden plans to retain Christopher Wray as FBI director and has confidence in the\njob Wray is doing.\nSing said: \"His (Wray's) characterization of China as posing a 'whole of society' threat to the US implies that all\nindividuals of Chinese descent are to be distrusted.\n\"Hopefully, Christopher Wray will also abide by President Biden's executive order to demonstrate cultural\ncompetency, language access, and sensitivity toward AAPI.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
