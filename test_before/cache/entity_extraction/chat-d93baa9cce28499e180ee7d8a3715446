I\nhave thought twice about spending time in public on days when allergies to cats, pollen, or wildfire smoke might\nmake me susceptible to the hazards of \"coughing while Asian.\" The anti-Asian violence was spurred on by\nwidespread rhetoric projecting blame for the COVID-19 pandemic onto China and people of Asian descent. But\nthe stigmatization of Chinese immigrants as a threat to public health and safety has a long history in the United\nStates. It emerges from an entrenched mode of racism that targets not only Chinese bodies, but Chinese air.\nWhat do I mean by \"Chinese air\"?\nAnswering that requires returning to the epidemic of violence that swept the West after Chinese immigrants\nbegan settling in the U.S. in the 19th century. White Americans refused to live in proximity with Chinese\nsettlements — literally, they refused to breathe the same air. The consequences were deadly. A mob massacred\n19 Chinese men in Los Angeles in 1871, and anti-Chinese race riots erupted in cities such as San Francisco,\nVancouver, and Seattle. Living on the periphery was no protection. As urban travelers in the West rode railroads\nbuilt by Chinese migrants to take in the pure air of nature resorts, more than 100 violent purges forced Chinese\nimmigrants out of rural settlements and into overcrowded, poorly ventilated accommodations in urban\nChinatowns.\nAt the time, many scientists didn't understand that microbes spread disease. Instead, they believed that illness was transmitted through poisonous air or miasma and endorsed changes to urban planning and sanitation in\ntheir efforts to sustain public health. Anti-Chinese agitators quickly adapted miasma theory as a tool in their\ncampaign.\nEven after germ theory gained acceptance in the 1880s, they stigmatized Chinese air and smells, associating\novercrowded spaces, laboring bodies, opium smoke, culinary odors, and incense in several urban Chinatowns\nwith disease.\nAs the historian Nayan Shah has documented, 19th-century San Francisco public health officials regularly\nblamed Chinatown for the city's recurring outbreaks of diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, and\nbubonic plague.\nIn response to the 1868 smallpox epidemic and working-class agitation against the Chinese, the city's Board of\nSupervisors passed the Cubic Air Ordinance in 1870, requiring that dwellings contain at least 500 \"cubic feet of\nair\" per adult resident.\nThis law was enforced exclusively against Chinese people, and critics noted that the city detained Chinese\nimmigrants in jails that were much more overcrowded than their homes. The Cubic Air Ordinance thus targeted\nChinese people not only as foreign bodies, but as deviant assemblages of bodies and air.\nSanitation became a common pretext for disciplining and displacing Chinese residents. In 1903, the physician\nWoods Hutchinson praised San Francisco's health officials for adopting aggressive cleaning methods: \"The seven\nand thirty separate smells of Chinatown have all been drowned in one grand olfactory delirium of chloride of\nlime and carbolic acid. Never was Chinatown so free from vermin.\"\nNevertheless, Hutchinson went on to declare that Chinatown \"can never be cleaned except by fire.\" He may\nhave had in mind a fire that burned down 4,000 homes in Honolulu's Chinatown, permanently displacing many\nresidents — a conflagration that started when Honolulu's Board of Health burned down buildings to control an\noutbreak of bubonic plague.\nHutchinson's fantasy for San Francisco nearly came true in 1906. In the wake of the city's devastating\nearthquake and fire, officials proposed relocating its Chinese community from the burned-out but centrally\nlocated Chinatown to far-flung Hunter's Point. This plan, which was eventually stopped after intervention from\nChina's consul-general, presumed that the Chinese community would not be out of place amid the latter\nneighborhood's slaughterhouses and industrial fumes.\nOn a smaller scale, American nuisance charges have also posited Chinese air as an offense to public well-being.\nIn the 1880s, complaints about the smell of drying squid shut down a thriving Chinese community of squid\nfishermen in Monterey, California. More recently, similar protests have been lodged against Asian restaurants\nand food manufacturers, including the Sriracha sauce factory in Irwindale, California.\nIn a 1999 case in Pennsylvania, grease smells from Wok's Chinese Restaurant were deemed \"noxious\" even\nthough, the defendant noted, they were comparable to the smell of burning wood from a nearby pizza\nrestaurant.\nThe notion of Chinese miasmas has had support from respected academics. In the 1890 essay \"Mongolianism in\nAmerica,\" the historian and ethnologist Hubert Howe Bancroft (for whom UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library is\nnamed) wrote that he found it difficult to breathe when he walked through the crowded alleys of San Francisco's\nChinatown. \"Faces swarm at every door, inhaling poison, exhaling worse,\" he claimed. Bancroft never considered\nthat he might be experiencing anxiety, triggered by his own discomfort with something unfamiliar.\nInstead, he speculated \"whether a Chinaman's lungs are not formed on a different principle from ours ... He\ncertainly seems to thrive in stench where others would suffocate.\" Attributing Chin\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
