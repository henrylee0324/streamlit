But when she tested for influenza, it came back negative.\nSmith had no reason to think much of it.\n\"It was just a matter of, 'Well, gee, there's people that are sick, and it's a variant of the flu that doesn't show up on\nthe flu test,'\" the county executive later said.\nBy mid-January, the novel coronavirus was still just a slightly ominous curiosity to most Americans.\nThe first U.S. news reports about the virus, published earlier that month, were full of unanswered questions and\nmistaken reports from China, including the initial belief that the virus could not be passed between humans.\nLife proceeded as normal. San Francisco's international airport was one of two in the United States that had direct\nflights to and from Wuhan. But members of the San Francisco Airport Commission, which oversees its operations,\nshowed no concern throughout January that it was an open portal for travelers from the viral epicenter.\nA review of the commission's meetings that month showed that its members never discussed the novel coronavirus.\nThe government body was instead immersed in its own drama: A restaurateur had been charged with attempting to\ngive one of the commission members a $5,000 bribe to open a rotisserie chicken joint in the airport.\nIn the meantime, during the month of January, more than 2,400 passengers flew direct from Wuhan to San Francisco\non China Southern Airlines Flight CZ659, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data on the VariFlight app.\nWhen a member of the airport commission finally did address the virus in early February, it was to urge travelers not\nto change their plans for Chinese New Year, a holiday during which people often traveled abroad to visit their families.\n\"I think it's important for us to continue these celebrations knowing that professionals and government are really\ntaking the right precautions,\" commissioner Malcolm Yeung said at the time.\nThe dynamics make the Bay Area a good case study for how the virus was allowed in unchecked.\nOn Jan. 19, tens of thousands of fans packed Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara for a major sports event: The NFL's\nconference championship game between the hometown San Francisco 49ers and the Green Bay Packers. The winner\nwould go to the Super Bowl.\nAt the time, most Americans knew relatively little about the novel coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention hadn't announced any cases in the United States.\nFans flew in from all over the country to attend the game. Masks and social distancing were not yet part of everyday\nlife.\nBesides the few hours spent in the open-air stadium, fans stayed at hotels, ate at restaurants and shopped at\nstores in the surrounding Santa Clara County, population 1.8 million.\nIt's impossible to draw a straight line from an event like this to a coronavirus outbreak without contact tracing, a\nnon-factor at the time. But around the area, there were deaths unattributed to COVID-19 that seem suspicious in\nhindsight. Like a senior living home resident — stricken with symptoms including a persistent fever — whose\nfamily was stunned by her sudden decline.\nOr the previously healthy 57-year-old woman who collapsed in her kitchen.\nCounty health officials assured residents they had no reason to worry about COVID-19, even as coroners listed\ncauses of deaths as \"pending,\" sometimes for months.\nOn the same day as the championship game, a 98-year-old woman named Marjorie Waggoner lay in a hospice bed\nat a senior living center 14 miles away in San Jose, with a cold towel folded over her forehead as a measure\nagainst the fever that had plagued her for more than a week.When her daughter Darryl Ospring took a photo of her that day, Waggoner was unconscious, scrawny and hollow-\neyed. It was a dramatic change from how she looked less than two months earlier, in a photo Ospring took aroundChristmas.\nWaggoner, who her kids said always seemed decades younger than she was, wore carefully coiffed short curly hair,\na cheesy holiday sweater, a necklace made of bells, and a big, childlike grin. She suffered from Alzheimer's and\nhad been in hospice for a year following a series of falls, but she was faring so well that administrators were\nconsidering returning her to normal care.\nBut on Jan. 8, Waggoner was tired and had no appetite. Within a few days, she had developed a cough, and then a\nfever, and her condition rapidly spiraled from there. She died on Jan. 22.\nOspring was surprised by the cause listed on the death certificate – \"complications from neurodegenerative\ndisease\" – given that her mother's nurse had told her before she died that her chief ailment was her persistent\nfever.\nWaggoner was not autopsied, and Ospring honored her request to be cremated, even if it ruined her chance at\never getting clear answers.\n\"I was trying to understand what happened to my mother in this small window of time,\" she said. \"It was as if the\nAngel of Death just came in and ushered her out.\"\nUnbeknownst to Ospring, she was not alone among residents of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
