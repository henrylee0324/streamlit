These biases can be conscious (explicit) or\nunconscious (implicit).\nBusiness Insider spoke to Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, a doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, a researcher of\nimplicit bias, to gain a greater understanding of bias in medicine.\nBoth explicit and implicit bias are prevalent in the medical field, and they can affect how patients of different races, genders, faiths, and\nsexualities are treated.\nDue in part to biases, black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to\nthe CDC.\nThough there has been great progress in reducing explicit biases, implicit biases are much harder to tackle, and they take active participation\nto identify and eliminate.\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\nBiases are present in many human interactions. These typically unfair assumptions, which can encompass entire groups of people, affect how\nwe feel about and treat members of other races, genders, faiths, weights, sexualities, and abilities. In healthcare, the effect of biases on\npatients can lead to dangerous consequences.\nExplicit biases, or conscious biases, are easier to detect because they are overt, according to Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, who co-authored Implicit\nbias in healthcare professionals: a systematic review, which was published in BMC Medical Ethics.\n\"If someone had explicit bias, they might say, 'Oh, you know, obese people just don't work as hard, or they're lazy,'\" Dr. Fitzgerald told\nBusiness Insider. However, \"if it was implicit, they might choose someone else over an obese person to do a task because they'll assume the\nobese person will be slower to do it,\" she said.\nDr. Jasmine Marcelin, who co-authored The Impact of Unconscious Bias in Healthcare: How to Recognize and Mitigate It in The Journal of\nInfectious Diseases, said a lower presence of minorities in the medical field perpetuates bias.\nDr. Fitzgerald and Dr. Marcelin identified ways biases affect the healthcare industry.\nExplicit bias against diverse groups has led to extreme abuse within the medical profession, like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted\nbetween 1932 and 1972.\nThe Tuskegee Syphilis Study was an experiment that spanned 40 years, starting in 1932. It involved 600 black men, 399 with syphilis, and\n201 without the disease, to test the effects of untreated syphilis. The study was carried out without their consent, as researchers told the men that they were being treated for \"bad blood,\" a term used to describe several ailments, including syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. (In 1974, a $10\nmillion settlement was reached out of court with the participants and their families, and in 1997, President Bill Clinton apologized to them on\nbehalf of the country.)\n\"The Tuskegee study demonstrated how conscious bias, in this case manifested in the form of racism, led to the unethical treatment of black\nmen that continues to have long-lasting effects on health equity and justice in today's society,\" Dr. Marcelin said.\nDue in part to biases, black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to\nthe CDC.\nDr. Fitzgerald said black women were historically abused by white doctors performing gynecological procedures on them without their consent.\nThese doctors held the false belief that black women somehow experienced less pain.\nThe field of infectious diseases is also affected by implicit bias, according to Dr. Marcelin.\nShe is passionate about reducing biases in the field of infectious disease.\n\"I definitely think from a pandemic standpoint there is a huge risk for minority groups who are affected. We have a lot of data that shows that\nthe effects of systemic racism and bias on minority groups has led to worse outcomes in those groups,\" she said.\nBlack people are 2.4 times more likely to die from the coronavirus.\nData from AMP Research Lab revealed that there were 54.5 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 in America's black population, while there\nwere 22.7 per 100,000 for America's white population.\nThough these deaths can be attributed in part to the way systemic racism makes black people less likely to have access to healthy food, green\nspaces, and livable wages, they could also be a result of the biases black people experience in healthcare.\nA review published in Academic Emergency Medicine compiled studies on implicit bias in healthcare professionals and found that a in a\nmajority of studies, physicians showed an implicit preference for white patients.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even released guidelines for healthcare professionals to ensure they are not allowing bias to\ninfluence their treatment of patients during the pandemic.\nBiases can also affect how medical professionals treat their colleagues, and minority medical professionals face microaggressions.\nMicroagressions are brief but common negative verbal or non-verbal behaviors against minorities.\nAn example Dr. Marcelin gave of a microagression is from a YouTube video in which an Asian woman is running on a trail in California, and\nanother jogger stops her and asks her where she's from. The woman responds that she is from California, but the other person says, \"No, but\nwhere are you from, from?\" This assumes that just because the woman is of Asian heritage, that she cannot be from the United States.\nDr. Marcelin shared that she herself has experienced bias in the workplace — from both patients and colleagues — as an African American\nfemale doctor.\nDr. Marcelin, not pictured, said, \"There are many times that I have walked into patient situations and they have assumed that I am not the one\nthat's in charge, even after I have\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
