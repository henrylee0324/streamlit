The GOP-controlled Senate refused to vote on it.\nThe legislation is named after Khalid Jabara, a man of Lebanese descent shot to death by a White neighbor in\nOklahoma in 2016, and Heather Heyer, a counterprotester killed at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville\nin 2017. Neither of their killings was included in the FBI's hate crime reports.\nWith Democrats in control of both chambers, Chu said she hoped to revive the legislative effort. Rep. Ted Lieu\n(D-Calif.) said he expects to gain bipartisan support for a letter to the Justice Department's new leadership\nteam similar to the one he sent last year with 150 co-signers from both parties asking then-Attorney General\nWilliam P. Barr to \"forcefully condemn anti-Asian bias.\" Barr did not respond to that letter, Lieu's office said.\nAdvocacy groups have sought to fill the breach through websites and hotlines that allow Asian Americans to\nself-report hate incidents, projects that share similarities to efforts from Muslim American groups to\ndocument bias crimes after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.\nStop AAPI Hate, a West Coast-based collective founded last spring in response to the pandemic, reported\n2,808 \"hate incidents\" nationwide aimed at Asian Americans from March through December 2020. For months\nleading to the November election, Trump sought to deflect blame over his management of the pandemic\nresponse by blaming China and using xenophobic and racist language to describe the virus on social media, in\ntelevised interviews and at campaign rallies and White House coronavirus task force briefings.\nThe group said verbal harassment made up 71 percent of the incidents, while physical assaults made up\nabout 9 percent. Organizers said the effort has helped raise media awareness and drawn celebrities to amplify\nthe message, but some experts cautioned that the data is largely unvetted.\n\"It's incredibly important for organizations to provide those kinds of narratives about the impact of hate, but\nat the end of the day it's anecdotal and cannot displace the onus on our government to provide accurate\ndata,\" said Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute, which helped draft early versions of\nthe No Hate legislation.\nJohn C. Yang, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC, which has collected self-reported incidents of anti-Asian bias since 2017, said his group also has tallied a spike in the past year. But he acknowledged that it is difficult for advocacy organizations to adequately analyze such information.\n\"Some recent incidents, whether they are anti-Asian or something else, is hard to tell,\" Yang said. \"As the\npandemic has worn on, the economic disparity has really played out and the physical and mental anxieties\nare playing out as well, and it's probably all contributing.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
