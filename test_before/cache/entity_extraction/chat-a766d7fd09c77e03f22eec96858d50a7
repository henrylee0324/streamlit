While working from home,\npeople are also eating meals at erratic hours, which further confuses the body and messes up the circadian rhythm,\" she adds. 76663953Sonali Malaviya, early 40s Tech marketing professional, Gurgaon\n\"Typically when you wake up in the night, you go back to sleep soon enough. These days that is not happening\"\nBefore Covid: Went to bed by 10:30\npm, out of bed by 6 am\nSince Covid: Wide awake by 3 am\nCause: Latent stress about the uncertain future\nWorkaround: Reading books - the paper version - and leaving all devices aside\nSome are more susceptible to sleep anxiety than others. \"Ethnic minorities like African Americans in the US and the Asians in the UK are more likely to have sleep problems,\" says Browning. Joshua Tal, a New York-based sleep and health psychologist, agrees. \"Due to systemic racism paired with the general distress around medical facilities at the moment, people of colour are likely to have more sleep-related anxieties during these times. They prefer going to practitioners of colour but there aren't a lot of insomnia experts of colour in the country, which leaves them feeling they are left alone,\" says Tal.\nAt MindPeers, 18-25-year-olds complain about sleep the most, citing concerns around uncertain career prospects. In the UK, Browning sees parents whose children are being home-schooled now suffering from lack of sleep. These parents care for kids during the day and tackle their work during late hours. \"Children are struggling with sleep, too,\" she says. \"In London, the Covid briefing happens at 5 pm. The kids watch the news along with parents and it affects them as well.\" As if lack of sleep wasn't enough, many are now having recurring nightmares.\n76663895\"Our online classes have moved to evenings because a lot of people have better internet connectivity during the second half of the day in their hometowns. We're studying from evening to morning now. Families have understood this is our new normal\"\nRavi Kant, 27, student at IIM-Shillong, lives in Patna Before Covid: Slept for 6-7 hours in the night\nSince Covid: Sleeps only for 2-3 hours early morning Cause: Disruption in college routine\nWorkaround: Embraced the new sleep cycle for the time being\nPeople in major Covid-hit cities like New York, Mumbai and London complain of vivid dreams that often align with the impact of the pandemic on their respective city. In New York, for instance, \"many talk about having disaster-related dreams where they see the city crumbling down in an Armageddon-like scenario,\" says Tal.\nIn Mumbai, Pateria's clients have spoken about dreaming of not being able to run away from an incoming threat. \"One of them said they saw someone coming to harm them but their legs were tied to each other so they couldn't escape.\" In the UK, people have had emotionally unsettling dreams connected to their family, says Browning.\nAs minds are on high alert almost all the time, these nightmares also wake them up in the wee hours of the night.\nWorries around sleep are valid. Therapists say a good sleep releases motivational hormones and charges up the mind and the body. A lack thereof makes way for stress hormones that result in physical and mental fatigue. Mumbai-based advert ising professional Omkar Joshi, 27, is worried his erratic sleep cycle during the lockdown period is turning into a habit that will be hard to come out of \"once normalcy returns\". However, Browning says this is likely to be a temporary issue and our bodies will be able to recover from this. \"Short-term sleep problems aren't going to kill anybody or every new set of parents would be dead,\" she says, reinforcing her point. Besides, losing sleep over sleeplessness may just make things worse. \"Embracing an erratic sleep cycle is the ideal approach at the moment, as sleep pressure compounds the issue,\" says Tal from New York.\nTherapists also ask their clients to build a sleep routine instead of worrying about not getting enough sleep. This routine involves visualising their sleeping environment - the bed, the bedsheet, the pillow - to ease them into the act of sleeping. Mobiles should be kept away from the bed and fragrant lotions and music should be used. Rajkumari Daga, a 57-year-old homemaker from Mumbai is following a \"no coffee after 7 and dinner by 8\" routine to revert to her normal sleep cycle of 11 pm to 7 am which has gone for a toss in the last three months, she says. Shalini L, a Mumbai-based marketing professional, listens to music from meditation apps like Calm and Headspace to quell her sleeping anxiety. \"Since mid-March, as news of the global health crisis steadily increased, Headspace saw a 33% increase in its sleep music usage over the last 30 days of usage,\" says Rich Pierson, the CEO & cofounder of Headspace. The app has over 10 million downloads on Android at present.\n76663913\nBrowning guides her clients on different breathing techniques to help them calm down. She also suggests people allocate some time during the day to process their worries, perhaps via expressive writing in journals.\n\"That way some of the tension is released during the day itself.\" At MindPeers, Agarwal's team of psychologists often ask their clients to draw their palm on a paper and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
