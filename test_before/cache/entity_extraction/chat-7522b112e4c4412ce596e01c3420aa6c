Now, they are donating supplies locally to help protect medical personnel who are treating infected patients.\nFalcon finds reports of assaults on Chinese-Americans troubling and says everyone is facing the same frustrations and uncertainty.\n\"There's so much negativity here, because people are in fear,\" she said. \"The market is dropping, they're losing a lot of money, they are losing their jobs, and there is a tremendous amount of anger over death and illness.\"\nBut instead of division, Falcon said now is the time for all Americans to work together to fight coronavirus.\n\"We're one of you,\" she said. \"We're all in this together. That is my main message. We all must work together -- we're a team.\" Palm Beach Post staff reporter Tom D'Angelo contributed to this story.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
