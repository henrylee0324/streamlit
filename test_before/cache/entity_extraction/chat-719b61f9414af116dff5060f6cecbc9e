including several in Northern California over the past month that attracted national attention -\nfollowed months of warnings from advocates that anti-China rhetoric from former president Donald Trump over\nthe coronavirus pandemic was contributing to a surge in anti-Asian slurs and violence.\nAlthough President Biden last month signed an executive action banning the federal government from employing\nthe sort of \"inflammatory and xenophobic\" language Trump used to describe the virus - such as \"China plague\"\nand \"kung flu\" - Asian American leaders said the recent attacks demonstrate a need for greater urgency in\ndealing with such threats.\nAmong other incidents, Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old San Francisco resident who had emigrated from\nThailand, was killed in late January, in a brazen attack captured on a video that went viral on social media.\nAntoine Watson, a 19-year-old African American man, was charged in connection with Ratanapakdee's death\nand has pleaded not guilty.\nBiden administration officials said they are working to address the problem, pointing to a section in the\nexecutive memo that instructed the Justice Department to expand its reporting, tracking and prosecutions of\n\"hate incidents.\" Officials said those efforts could go beyond hate crimes to include episodes of harassment and\ndiscrimination.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing Monday, Merrick Garland, Biden's nominee for attorney general, pledged\nto support such efforts.\n\"Hate crimes tear at the fabric of our society. They make our citizens worried about walking the streets and\nexercising even the most normal rights,\" Garland said. \"The role of the [Justice Department's] Civil Rights\nDivision is to prosecute those cases vigorously, and I can ensure you that it will if I am confirmed.\"\nA 1990 federal law mandates that the FBI collect data specifically on hate crimes each year, but the effort has\nlong been plagued by incomplete and inconsistent data provided by the nation's estimated 18,000 state,\nmunicipal and tribal law enforcement agencies.\nThe administration is in the early stages of identifying strategies to compel broader participation. Among the\nideas advocates have pushed for is tying federal funding from the Justice Department's extensive grant\nprograms to increased training and reporting on hate crimes.\nIn 2019, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report recommending Congress adopt legislation to\nprovide funding for incentives and calling on local police to establish dedicated hate-crime units. Catherine E.\nLhamon, who chaired that commission, now serves as deputy director for racial justice and equity on the White\nHouse domestic policy council.\nAt a news conference last week, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Asian Pacific American Caucus, said she is\nrequesting a meeting with Justice Department leaders to discuss what she called a \"crisis point\" for the Asian\nAmerican community in dealing with \"an alarming surge of anti-Asian bigotry across the nation.\"\nChu added that the 1990 law on reporting of hate crime data \"doesn't have any teeth\" because it does not\ncompel localities to comply or to do so in a consistent and thorough manner.\nLast fall, the FBI reported 7,314 hate crimes nationwide in 2019, the most in a decade - but experts said the\nstatistics were woefully inadequate because too few local law enforcement agencies fully participate in federal\ndata collection efforts.\nThe FBI said that 15,588 law enforcement organizations participated in the 2019 hate crimes study, but just\n2,172 agencies reported the total number of incidents contained in the report. Civil rights advocates called that\nscenario implausible, pointing out that the entire state of Alabama reported no hate crimes to the FBI in both\n2018 and 2019.\n\"The FBI reports help us identify trends, but their data is so woefully inadequate that it can't be relied on for\nmuch,\" said civil rights lawyer Arjun Singh Sethi, author of \"American Hate: Survivors Speak Out.\"\nSome big-city law enforcement agencies have publicly reported an increase in bias attacks against Asian\nAmericans. For example, New York City's hate crimes task force investigated 27 incidents in 2020, including 24\ntied to the coronavirus, a ninefold increase from the previous year.\nBut experts said local police agencies lack training and funding to properly investigate hate crimes, and many treat it as a low priority. Some conservative Republicans have opposed more stringent reporting requirements\nto determine whether crimes are motivated by hate, arguing that such measures are redundant.\nYet advocates have pointed to a 2013 study from the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics that\nfound an average of 259,700 violent and property-related hate crimes from 2003 through 2011 after\nassessing data from the annual National Crime Victimization Survey of American households.\nIn a statement, the FBI said participation in its data program is \"voluntary.\" The agency added that it\nanticipates the reporting methods would improve in the coming years as a greater percentage of local police\nagencies transitions into the National Incident Based Reporting System, which requires more detailed and\nconsistent data.\nIn a bipartisan vote last year, the House approved the Jabara-Heyer No Hate Act, which aimed to bolster\nfederal aid to localities for hate-crime training and reporting. The GOP-controlled Senate refused to vote on it.\nThe legislation is named after Khalid Jabara, a man of Lebanese descent shot to death by a White neighbor in\nOklahoma in 2016, and Heather Heyer, a counterpro\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
