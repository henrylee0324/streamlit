He will talk people out of surgeries,\" she says.\nI ask about her own list of regular treatments. \"Ironically I'm very needlephobic,\" she admits. Her husband had to hire an anaesthesiologist to sedate her just\nso she could have Botox. Now, though, they have a machine called a Pro-Nox. \"It's nitrous oxide,\" she says ? laughing gas ? \"and I breathe into it, then he [Gabriel] puts in some Botox and filler.\"\nInstagram is her playground. On it she leads, by her own admission, a \"frivolous, materialistic\" lifestyle. As a child she was not allowed dolls, only books ? \"just black and white and ink for me\" ? because her\nparents wanted her to focus on her studies. In traditional Asian culture, she says, when a woman gets married she leaves her old family and joins a new one. \"My late twenties were like a new chapter for me. It\nwas my chance to relive all these suppressed little girl fantasies I had. And I really went for it.\"\nShe began bingeing on couture and today tries to buy one piece from every fashion show she attends ? sometimes costing six figures apiece. However, although she looked as if she were living the Californian\ndream on Instagram, behind the scenes she was going through increasingly invasive IVF treatment, \"burning out\" her body.\n\"I can see how [my husband's parents] were looking at my life from the outside and thinking, this girl doesn't want to be a mom, she just wants to wear her designer clothing and travel.\" The pressure was building\non her to have a son, with her in-laws blaming her body and health. \"In the eastern Asian culture you don't talk back [to elders]. It's just how it goes. So I would say, 'I'm sorry, I'm trying, I will do better, I\npromise.' \" Didn't she mind carrying the can for her husband's infertility ? an issue that she says stemmed from \"a medical problem he had from when he was very young\" ? for 11 years? \"I really don't know what\nmy in-laws' response would have been if I'd said it wasn't me. I don't know if they would have accepted it. It's a very east Asian expectation for the wife to protect the husband and to protect the family. It was my\nduty and my role. I wasn't OK with it, but I knew that's what I had to do.\"\nAt one point the couple considered using a sperm donor and smuggling a biologically illegitimate heir past Gabriel's family. \"I remember looking at these photos of donors and thinking, could this pass off[as\nGabriel]? Then I remember thinking, they would DNA the baby, there's no way we could pull this off.\"\nChristine thought she was going to take the secret of her husband's fertility issues with her to the grave, until it \"blurted\" out of her mouth as the Bling Empire cameras were rolling. Her husband discusses it on\ncamera too. She says she is talking about it now in order to push against Asian expectations of privacy and, as a result, ease\nthe shame. Huge numbers of people have got in touch with her as a result.\n\"I didn't realise that so many Asian women were undergoing IVF ? whether it's because of male or female infertility.\nWe're in the same boat, feeling the pain and pressure from in-laws and parents.\" She hasn't spoken to her own in-laws about whether they have seen the show. She's hoping they have not.\nNow two and a half, Baby G is their \"miracle\" child and Christine is out of \"the doghouse\" with the Chiu family. Still, she wants to make sure that her son retains his Chinese and Taiwanese identity and the intimacy\nwith his grandparents' culture, while embracing the Californian values that resonate with her. \"I still feel confined by tougher eastern expectations. I don't think I get to enjoy the casual vulnerability of a typical\nCalifornian. But I want Baby G to grow up knowing it's OK to be mad and struggle and talk about things openly.\"\nNaturally Baby G has a trust fund, but Christine says he must \"build his own\nlegacy and not measure success by money\". The naming of the two lodges at the Prince's Foundation Health & Wellbeing Centre in his honour was their seven-month birthday present to him. (\"I have to say we\nhave been longtime supporters and fans of Prince Charles for his commitment and dedication to his people and his country,\"\nshe gushes. \"He's just a really remarkable man, and so funny too! Really witty ? he has the best sense of humour.\") For Baby G's first birthday, the couple made a $1 million donation in his name to the Cayton\nChildren's Museum in Santa Monica. It was announced at a birthday party that boasted circus performers, a ten-course meal and an arcade claw machine that picked out Gucci presents.\nAccording to Christine, Baby G spoke sign language before he was a year old, and today is learning Mandarin, French and English. During the recent Covid lockdowns the Chius have converted a portion of their\nguesthouse into a school and hired a tutor. Baby G is taught a broad curriculum that includes drawing, painting, global music, drumming, sound healing\nand yoga. In the afternoons they tend to the vegetable patch in order to teach him about sustainability or hang out with the llamas, borrowed from a rescue programme after Baby G was \"naturally drawn to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
