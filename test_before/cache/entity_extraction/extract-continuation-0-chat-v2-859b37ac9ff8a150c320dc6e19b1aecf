A few weeks earlier in Texas, a man targeted and stabbed a Burmese-American man and his two children, ages 2 and 6, at a Sam's Club. He said he had attempted to kill the family because he believed they were Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus. One of the children had a laceration wound from his ear across his eye.\nThese are among the worst examples of thousands of anti-Asian incidents that have been reported since the Covid-19 crisis began. Two weeks after launching its Coronavirus Anti-AAPI Racism Incident Report platform in mid-March, a coalition of Asian-American groups has received over 1,100 reports of incidents of coronavirus-related attacks and racial discrimination. Many more cases likely go unreported.\nUnited States President Donald Trump's use of the term Chinese virus may have fanned the flames, but although he has stepped back from using the term and issued a tweet in support of our Asian-American community, he has not directed a strong governmental response towards protecting Asians and people of Asian heritage. (Notably, although the US is a party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Trump hasn't nominated a representative to the treaty's monitoring body.)\nStill, federal government agencies can act on their own to address this upsurge in racism. The US Commission on Civil Rights has recently raised concerns about the new racism and violence. Additionally, the Department of Education has issued guidance to educators, directing them to protect students at risk of anti-Asian harassment, after a 16-year-old Asian-American boy was attacked by his classmates and hospitalized. And the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has stated that during Covid-19, protecting civil rights and investigating hate crimes remain a high priority. But the FBI should also set up a task force to focus on the specific new problems associated with Covid-19 and better coordinate with local and state officials.\nFederal agencies that have stayed silent should also work to protect people from Covid-19 related bigotry. Racism against Asian-Americans is real, and it is dangerous. The US government needs to take it more seriously.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BROOKLYN<|>GEO<|>Brooklyn is a borough of New York City where an Asian woman suffered an acid attack.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a state in the United States where Brooklyn is located.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEXAS<|>GEO<|>Texas is a state in the United States where a man targeted a Burmese-American family.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAM'S CLUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sam's Club is a retail warehouse club where a stabbing incident occurred involving a Burmese-American family.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the President of the United States who used the term \"Chinese virus\" and has been criticized for his response to anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country where incidents of anti-Asian racism have been reported during the Covid-19 crisis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The US Commission on Civil Rights is a federal agency that has raised concerns about racism and violence against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Department of Education is a federal agency that issued guidance to protect students from anti-Asian harassment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The FBI is a federal agency that prioritizes protecting civil rights and investigating hate crimes during the Covid-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORONAVIRUS ANTI-AAPI RACISM INCIDENT REPORT<|>EVENT<|>The Coronavirus Anti-AAPI Racism Incident Report platform was launched to document incidents of racism against Asian-Americans during the Covid-19 crisis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>16-YEAR-OLD ASIAN-AMERICAN BOY<|>PERSON<|>A 16-year-old Asian-American boy who was attacked by classmates and hospitalized.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROOKLYN<|>NEW YORK<|>Brooklyn is a borough located within the state of New York<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEXAS<|>SAM'S CLUB<|>A stabbing incident involving a Burmese-American family occurred at Sam's Club in Texas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>UNITED STATES<|>Donald Trump is the President of the United States and has been involved in the discourse surrounding anti-Asian racism<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>US COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS<|>The US Commission on Civil Rights is a federal agency operating within the United States<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION<|>The Department of Education is a federal agency within the United States<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION<|>The FBI is a federal agency that operates within the United States<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORONAVIRUS ANTI-AAPI RACISM INCIDENT REPORT<|>UNITED STATES<|>The report platform was launched in the United States to document anti-Asian incidents<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>16-YEAR-OLD ASIAN-AMERICAN BOY<|>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION<|>The Department of Education issued guidance to protect students like the 16-year-old Asian-American boy from harassment<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
