Still, business was down 70% in New York's Chinatown, the trade magazine Restaurant Hospitality reported in March.\nBut no one reported a comparable downtick in Italian restaurants. Not even in late March, when Italy's death toll surpassed China's, with as many as 250 people dying in a day. No one worried about whether Mario, at the pizzeria, might have just returned from Naples.\nScapegoats — particularly in an epidemic — can also be useful.\nCOVID has been branded \"Chinese Virus\" and even \"Kung Flu\" by politicians who want to make sure we never forget which ethnic group is to \"blame.\" Gays and Haitians were stigmatized for AIDS — labeled a \"gay disease\" even though in some parts of the world, like sub-Saharan Africa, it's largely heterosexual. The English called syphilis \"the French Disease.\" The Dutch called rickets \"the English Disease.\" The \"Spanish Flu\" — the last modern pandemic comparable to COVID-19 — didn't originate in Spain. It just happened that Spain, being neutral during World War I, was the first to report the disease; other countries suppressed the news for propaganda reasons.\nIn the early 1900s, the career of \"Typhoid Mary\" Mallon, an Irish cook who infected 51 people in seven families, led to an upswing in anti-Irish prejudice. Irish immigrants were dirty, unsanitary — what more proof did you need than this one bizarre case? You certainly didn't want them cooking your soup or washing your bed linens.\nAnd, of course, the \"Black Death\" pandemic of the 14th century led to hate crimes galore — particularly against Jews, who were burned in large numbers.\nWho's afraid?\n\"The dominant thing is fear of the unknown,\" said Lisa Lyons, a clinical psychologist practicing in Teaneck and New York. \"It's all about the terror of what they don't know. So they blame the outsider: the Asian woman, the Irish cook, the Orthodox Jew.\"\nThe plague-bringer — the invader from somewhere else, bringing contagion — is a very old cultural memory.\nYou can see it vividly enacted in the classic 1922 silent film \"Nosferatu\" — an early \"Dracula\" movie that taps into medieval ideas about disease. In the film, a ghost ship sails into the town harbor at night. A gaunt stranger — the vampire — disembarks, followed by hundreds of plague rats. A few days later, the streets are full of funerals.\n\"Nosferatu! Was it he who brought the plague to Bremen in 1838?\" reads a title card.\nThe Other might be personified as vampires — a tuberculosis epidemic in 19th-century New England was, in fact, blamed on them. Or it might be any ethnic, social or religious group that is considered out of the mainstream.\n\"You can tell people that, and they will even say themselves that this is ridiculous,\" Rockland said. \"But there's a part of them that still believes it. Things don't happen without some sort of conspiracy.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is a city in China that has been associated with the outbreak of COVID-19)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOCKHOLM<|>GEO<|>Stockholm is the capital city of Sweden)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a major city in the United States, known for its diverse population and significant cultural influence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in New York City known for its Chinese cultural heritage and businesses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALY<|>GEO<|>Italy is a country in Europe that experienced a significant death toll during the COVID-19 pandemic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARIO<|>PERSON<|>Mario is a fictional character representing a pizzeria owner in New York's Italian community)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAPLES<|>GEO<|>Naples is a city in Italy, known for its rich history and as the birthplace of pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, leading to widespread illness and death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYPHOID MARY<|>PERSON<|>Typhoid Mary, also known as Mary Mallon, was an Irish cook who was a carrier of typhoid fever and became a symbol of public health fears)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK DEATH<|>EVENT<|>The Black Death was a devastating pandemic in the 14th century that resulted in the deaths of millions and led to widespread social and cultural changes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LISA LYONS<|>PERSON<|>Lisa Lyons is a clinical psychologist practicing in Teaneck and New York, providing insights into societal fears and prejudices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOSFERATU<|>EVENT<|>Nosferatu is a classic 1922 silent film that depicts themes of disease and fear associated with outsiders)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WUHAN<|>NEW YORK<|>Wuhan is associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, which significantly impacted New York's Chinatown<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITALY<|>NEW YORK<|>Italy's death toll during the pandemic was a concern for the Italian restaurants in New York<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARIO<|>NAPLES<|>Mario represents the Italian restaurant culture in New York, which is linked to Naples as the birthplace of pizza<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>NEW YORK<|>COVID-19 has led to significant changes and challenges for businesses in New York, including Chinatown<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYPHOID MARY<|>NEW YORK<|>Typhoid Mary is an example of how public health fears can lead to prejudice against certain ethnic groups, similar to the situation in New York<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLACK DEATH<|>NEW YORK<|>The Black Death serves as a historical example of how pandemics can lead to scapegoating and prejudice, relevant to current events in New York<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LISA LYONS<|>NEW YORK<|>Lisa Lyons provides psychological insights into the fears and prejudices that arise in New York during health crises<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOSFERATU<|>BLACK DEATH<|>Nosferatu reflects cultural fears of disease and outsiders, similar to the societal reactions during the Black Death<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
