\"alarming level\" amid the COVID-19 pandemic, United Nations officials said.\nIn a report made public this week, UN officials expressed \"serious concern over the rising wave of racist and xenophobic attacks,\" which they said President Trump is\n\"seemingly legitimizing.\"\nAsian-American groups have asked public officials such as Trump to refrain from using terms such as \"China virus\" to refer to COVID-19.\n\"Our data and evidence of the real-life stories confirm that Asian-Americans are facing increasing racist and xenophobic attacks, catalyzed by rhetoric from the\npresident and other government leadership,\" said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council.\nHate crimes against Asian-Americans have reached an \"alarming level\" across the United States, in part because President Donald Trump appears to validate the\nperpetrators' bigotry, according to a report by United Nations officials made public this week.\nCiting more than 1,800 racist incidents against Asian Americans from March to May 2020, the report — signed by the UN's special rapporteurs on racism and migrant\nrights, as well as the head of the international body's working group on discrimination against women — expresses \"serious concern over the rising wave of racist and\nxenophobic attacks,\" particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\nUS authorities, it said, have \"utterly failed to take the steps required to detect, monitor, and prevent racist and xenophobic incidents,\" resulting in a \"state of impunity\"\nfor hateful chauvinists.\nIn April, Senate Democrats sent a letter to Trump noting guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advising against terms, such as \"Chinese\nvirus\" and \"Wuhan virus,\" that \"exacerbate prejudice and discrimination in ways that place lives at risk of violence.\"\nTrump has disregarded that advice, telling Fox News just this past Sunday that he had \"beat this crazy horrible China virus.\"\nAsian-Americans, in turn, have reported ever more incidents of bigotry. Between March and August 2020, there were more such incidents — over 2,500 — than at the\nstart of the pandemic, according to researchers at Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition formed to combat racism during the pandemic.\nIn one reported incident, a Japanese-American woman walking in Los Angeles, California, with her two-year-old son said a white man rolled down his window and\nsaid, \"Tell your kid when he grows up that China did this all.\" On the other side of the country, at a grocery store outside Scranton, Pennsylvania, a man yelled, \"This\npandemic wouldn't have happened if you stayed in your country where you belong,\" punctuated with a racial slur.\n\"We are further concerned by the documented increase in hate and misogynist speech, including incitement to hatred and racial discrimination in public places and\nonline, and the contribution of the President of the United States in seemingly legitimizing these violations,\" the report said.\nPrevious research has suggested there is a link between the president's rhetoric and the skyrocketing incidence of hate crimes that has accompanied his presidency.\nIn 2017, for example, researchers at Tufts University found that, among test subjects, \"exposure to Trump's prejudiced statements made people more likely to write\noffensive things.\"\n\"Our data and evidence of the real-life stories confirm that Asian-Americans are facing increasing racist and xenophobic attacks, catalyzed by rhetoric from the\npresident and other government leadership,\" Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, and a leader of Stop AAPI Hate,\nsaid in a statement on Wednesday.\nIn September, House Democrats passed a resolution calling on public officials to condemn anti-Asian racism and refrain from using terms such as \"Chinese virus\" and\n\"Kung flu.\" But Republicans have resisted such pleas. Rep. Jim Jordan, of Ohio, a close Trump ally, dismissed the resolution as \"just another opportunity to attack the\npresident,\" while Rep. Andy Biggs, of Arizona, deemed it \"woke culture on steroids.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations is an international organization that addresses global issues, including human rights and discrimination, and has expressed concern over rising hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States, whose rhetoric has been linked to an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANJUSHA KULKARNI<|>PERSON<|>Manjusha Kulkarni is the executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and a leader of Stop AAPI Hate, advocating against racism during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC POLICY AND PLANNING COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council is an organization focused on issues affecting Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a coalition formed to combat racism and xenophobia against Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to increased hate crimes and discrimination against Asian-Americans, exacerbated by political rhetoric.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles is a city in California where incidents of hate crimes against Asian-Americans have been reported during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PENNSYLVANIA<|>GEO<|>Pennsylvania is a state in the United States where incidents of hate crimes against Asian-Americans have been reported during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUMP<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>The United Nations has expressed concern that Trump's rhetoric is legitimizing hate crimes against Asian-Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANJUSHA KULKARNI<|>ASIAN PACIFIC POLICY AND PLANNING COUNCIL<|>Manjusha Kulkarni is the executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, leading efforts against racism<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANJUSHA KULKARNI<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Manjusha Kulkarni is a leader of Stop AAPI Hate, advocating against racism during the pandemic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>TRUMP<|>Trump's rhetoric during the COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Stop AAPI Hate was formed in response to the rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Los Angeles has seen an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PENNSYLVANIA<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Pennsylvania has reported incidents of hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
