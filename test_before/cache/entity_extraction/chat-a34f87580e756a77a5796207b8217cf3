It also noted that an Instagram post last week called for shooting \"every Asian we meet in Chinatown, that's the only way\nwe can destroy the epidemic of coronavirus in NYC!\" (Instagram removed the post as a violation of its policies.)\nA second research group, featuring an international team of scholars from China, Cyprus, Italy, Germany and the United States, published separate research\nshowing that anti-Chinese slurs on 4chan grew sharply at key moments in the pandemic. It also found less pronounced rises in hostile references to China and\nChinese people on Twitter.\nThe title of that paper highlighted one of the many anti-Asian comments the team captured from 4chan, \" 'Go eat a bat, Chang!': An Early Look on the\nEmergence of Sinophobic Behavior on Web Communities in the Face of COVID-19.\" Another 4chan post was even blunter, saying \"THIS IS BIOTERRORISM\nNUKE CHINA NOW.\" (The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed, a process that typically takes months.)\nBoth research groups, which include some overlapping members, charted rises in these slurs near the peak of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, where the\npandemic began, and again last month when President Trump used the term \"Chinese Virus\" on Twitter.\nThe research does not seek to evaluate whether Trump's comments caused the surge of ethnic slurs on 4chan, but \"that was a legitimizing moment,\" said\nJeremy Blackburn, an assistant professor of computer science at Binghamton University who studies online hate. He was a co-author for both papers.\nBeyond the Internet, anti-Chinese rhetoric already has had real-life implications in the United States, despite warnings from experts that prolific use of such\nlanguage could endanger millions of Asian Americans.\n\"When it becomes normalized . . . it dehumanizes Chinese and Asians,\" said Russell Jeung, chair of San Francisco State University's Asian American studies\ndepartment. \"It's like equating them to a face mask and equating them to the disease, so it's easy to scapegoat and attack them.\"\nPeople who look Chinese, particularly those wearing masks, are at increased risk of experiencing the same discrimination faced by people wearing turbans in\nthe aftermath of the 9/11, attacks, said Jeung, who recently started tracking bias incidents against Asian Americans amid the ongoing pandemic.\nAt first, Jeung's work consisted of analyzing news articles about the coronavirus, xenophobia and racism. It didn't take long, he said, for a \"clear pattern\" to\nemerge.\n\"Following xenophobic policies or statements, the next week we would see boycotts of Asian businesses and then the following week more interpersonal\nattacks on Asian individuals,\" he said.\nA website, \"Stop AAPI Hate\" started by Jeung and two community groups, has documented more than 1,100 incidents targeting Asian Americans in at least 36\nstates since launching last month. (AAPI refers to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\nThe incidents have ranged from verbal harassment and shunning to physical assault.\nOn March 9, a woman in San Francisco said she was spat on by a man yelling expletives about China, the New York Times reported. Later that month, an\nAsian woman riding a New York City bus was targeted by several other passengers who called her a racial slur and accused her of causing the coronavirus,\nWPIX reported. One of the attackers then struck the woman on the head with an umbrella, resulting in an injury that needed stitches, according to the news\nstation.\nYang Zhang, a Chinese co-author on the paper written by the international coalition of scholars, said he grew interested in the subject after a Chinese student\nhe knows had an unpleasant encounter on a bus in Germany. One passenger said to another that the student was a \"Chinese virus,\" said Zhang, a computer\nscientist at the Helmholtz Center for Information Security, in Saarbrücken, Germany.\nZhang said that \"even as a man who is used to hearing racial slurs about Chinese people,\" he was startled to discover the range and intensity of hateful\nlanguage he found on social media once he began research for the paper. Like the others, he worried that the hostility already had spilled out in the offline\nworld.\n\"I always treat social media data as a good sensor of the real world,\" said Zhang.\nCharissa Cheah, a psychology professor at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County who is leading another study examining discrimination against\nChinese Americans during the pandemic, said anti-Chinese language such as \"kungflu\" and \"batsoup\" have their\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
