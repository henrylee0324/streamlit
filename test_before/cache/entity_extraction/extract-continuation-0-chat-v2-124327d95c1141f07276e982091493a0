The man was short, stocky, roughly my father's age. Suddenly he was standing before me as I sat having a drink on a bench. He pointed at the face mask crumpled in his other fist.\n\"This is shit,\" he informed me. I blinked out of confusion.\n\"Corona comes from China,\" he clarified. \"It's shit, what you brought here.\"\nMy first thought was the image on the cover of German news magazine Der Spiegel, in late January. It was a photo of an Asian person in a red hazmat suit, captioned with an alarming yellow font \"Made in China: When Globalization Becomes a Deadly Threat.\nI stared at the man. He seemed like a meek, ordinary retiree. I tried to see what he saw in me-and I could, because I'd ingested those same images my whole life. Looking at my face is to look at centuries of Eastern bodies in the white imagination: the silent, \"almond-eyed masseuse; the replicated worker manufacturing replicas; the sun-dried slave born in a bamboo forest, who built your railroads but will nonetheless steal your social security. There's the buck-toothed cook, and small-footed prostitute.\nFaces like mine have freakishly adorned magazines, movies, books, and posters since Marco Polo galloped home in the 13th century. As an Asian woman who spent her life in the West, I can assure you that the pain of understanding yourself through the gaze of whites is double-edged: it kills you, then shows you how to survive.\nBut the title of pandemic creator was a first. Racism is dynamic; it morphs to fit political expediency. And it is exposing a harrowing crack in the European project. Amidst the global reckoning about race ignited by the death of George Floyd, I want to make one thing clear: that Western Europe touts a vile relativism when it comes to facing its own racism. It points its finger at the US as if to say, we're not as bad as that.\nI'd like to remind them, in my red hazmat suit, of just one detail: that the adolescent nation internally combusting from racial pain was the brainchild of European colonialism. That is to say: it is, and always was, a project founded on the vision of white supremacy.\nA matter of bad manners\nLet's address the curiosity before it gets in the way: I am Chinese. I grew up in the US, studied in Europe, and have been living in Berlin for six years. It goes without saying that the racism I endure in the West is persistent, quotidian, and mind-numbingly unoriginal. But because I am not getting knifed by Nazis, most Germans diminish my experiences to a matter of bad manners by bad people.\n\"He's just a racist nut,\" a German friend said of the vitriolic pensioner (as if that were ever a source of comfort.) \"Most people aren't like that.\"\nWhen she said \"most people,\" I didn't know if she included her own sister, who imitated the Chinese language in front of me at the dinner table. (A resounding performance akin to, as the old joke goes, throwing a fork down the stairs.) Or my former water polo coach, who referred to the slits in\na kickboard as my eyes. Or the French boutique owner who approached me at a bar to continue the Olympic pastime of verifying \"what kind of Asian\" I was-just so she could win a bet with her friend.\nAnd lest we forget those self-congratulating liberals who actually work in the name of human rights and journalistic diversity-whose insistence on their non-racism is so dogged and shameless that on my first day at work, they invited me to an editorial conference during which I realized I was the only person of color at a table of twenty.\nI certainly don't consider any of the above people nuts. They just seem to equate poor manners with systemic oppression and othering rooted in the racial hierarchy their ancestors created at the beginning of their conquest of Earth. And this is something Germans seem to know little about: not a single German I've met knew that a part of China was once their colonial project-Qingdao, my grandparents' ancestral home, where the Kaiser blew through with his Navy and set up shop to brew his beloved pilsner, still widely exported today.\nAnd thus I find it distasteful to have to remind Germans, in their own country, about what Hannah Arendt meant when she wrote about the banality of evil. It is not murderous, diabolic scheming - but rather the \"inability to think, namely, to think from the standpoint of somebody else, that leads us to unfathomable chambers.\nHow bad is 'bad'?\nI got ahead of myself when I said I wasn't getting knifed by Nazis. A few months ago, a woman of East Asian descent living in the Netherlands woke up to a swastika scratched into the hallway outside her flat. In Munich, a German woman from China was assaulted by a neighbor, who sprayed her with disinfectant, screamed \"corona,\" and threatened to cut off her head.\nThe morning after my incident, my Vietnamese neighbor posted a notice on our building door that for over a month, someone had been stuffing trash and used tissues in his mailbox. \"I don't know what your mailboxes look like,\" he wrote, \"but mine looks like corona racism.\" Getting harassed on the street is close, but at home is closer.\nTo live in a place is to continue its history. What I felt in this moment was a cold-s\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DW is a German international broadcaster that provides news and information in multiple languages, including English, and often addresses social issues such as racism and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEINA XU<|>PERSON<|>Beina Xu is a writer and journalist for DW who reflects on personal experiences with racism and societal issues related to race in Europe.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Germany is a country in Western Europe where the events described in the essay take place, particularly regarding racism and societal attitudes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE<|>GEO<|>Europe is a continent that is discussed in the context of race and racism, particularly in relation to the experiences of individuals of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is referenced as the country associated with the coronavirus and the source of racist sentiments expressed by individuals in Europe.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETHERLANDS<|>GEO<|>The Netherlands is mentioned as a location where an incident of racism occurred against a woman of East Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUNICH<|>GEO<|>Munich is a city in Germany where a racist attack against a Chinese woman took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QINGDAO<|>GEO<|>Qingdao is a city in China that was once a German colonial project, mentioned in the context of historical racism and colonialism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Hannah Arendt<|>PERSON<|>Hannah Arendt was a political theorist known for her works on the nature of evil and totalitarianism, referenced in the context of understanding systemic oppression.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEINA XU<|>DW<|>Beina Xu is a journalist for DW, contributing to discussions on race and societal issues through her personal essays<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEINA XU<|>GERMANY<|>Beina Xu's experiences with racism are situated within the context of living in Germany<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEINA XU<|>EUROPE<|>Beina Xu's reflections on race and racism are relevant to broader discussions about these issues in Europe<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEINA XU<|>CHINA<|>Beina Xu discusses her Chinese heritage and the impact of racism related to the coronavirus<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEINA XU<|>NETHERLANDS<|>Beina Xu references incidents of racism occurring in the Netherlands, highlighting a broader issue of racism in Europe<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEINA XU<|>MUNICH<|>Beina Xu mentions a specific incident of racism that occurred in Munich, connecting her experiences to that location<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEINA XU<|>QINGDAO<|>Beina Xu references Qingdao in the context of historical colonialism and its impact on perceptions of race<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Hannah Arendt<|>BEINA XU<|>Hannah Arendt's ideas about the banality of evil are invoked by Beina Xu to discuss systemic racism<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
