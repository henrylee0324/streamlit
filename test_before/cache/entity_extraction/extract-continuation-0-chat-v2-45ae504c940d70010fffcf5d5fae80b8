Oh, an attorney, was on her guard.The two men drew closer.“Infected and disgusting,” one called out as they passed, she said.Heart racing, she ducked into a drugstore.“I didn't think to say anything back when I heard it,\" she said. \"It really only sunk in as I was walking away.\"Stepping back onto the street, Oh, 30, walked toward her car as an older couple approached. The woman made a show of detouring around her, she said.“The woman literally walked off the sidewalk to be as far from me as possible,” Oh said. “There was no one else around and it was so obnoxious.”One incident, she might have written off as the kind of casual racism she has encountered all her life as the daughter of Korean immigrants. But two, in such a short time? It was clear, she said, that she was being targeted because she is Asian.“You could feel the sense of hatred and scapegoating that was being built,” Oh said. “I avoided going out by myself for a while.\"Asian Americans across the United States are reporting a significant increase in hate crimes, harassment and discrimination tied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a year after these attacks began, the pandemic has galvanized Asian Americans, many of whom have long felt invisible, to speak out about the hatred and racism being directed their way.Community leaders are calling for greater enforcement of existing hate-crime laws, better connections with local police departments charged with investigating hateful incidents, and other Americans to consider the impact of their words and actions on the country’s estimated 21 million Asian Americans. Asian American entertainers are using their platforms to highlight the issues, Asian American journalists are sharing their own stories of discrimination on social media and a growing chorus of federal lawmakers are demanding action.The pandemic has especially “struck a nerve” for the Asian American community, which has forced many to realize that simple discrimination can turn violent, said Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who is a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. The fight against the “bamboo ceiling” is now also about physical safety, he said.“For a large number of Asian Americans, especially the young generation, they’re now seeing for the first time actual violence directed at them or their grandparents,” Lieu said. “It’s highly disturbing.”In January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order condemning the attacks – and without naming them, criticizing former President Donald Trump and other federal officials who repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the “China virus” or the “Kung flu.” The order calls for better data collection about hateful incidents, and mandates federal agencies to fight “racism, xenophobia, and intolerance” directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, or AAPI.“The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin,” Biden said in his order. “Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.”Among recent incidents: In January, an 84-year-old Thai American man was brutally shoved in San Francisco and later died. That same month, police in Oakland, California, said a young man shoved three elderly people to the ground from behind in the city's Chinatown neighborhood, knocking out one. And this week, a 36-year old Asian man in New York’s Chinatown neighborhood was stabbed and taken to a hospital in critical condition. The suspect in that assault faces charges that include attempted murder as a hate crime and assault as a hate crime, among other charges, the New York Police Department said.The surge in hate incidents against the Asian American community since the start of the pandemic was set aflame last winter when Trump began scapegoating Chinese people for the explosion of coronavirus in the United States.“It gave a lot of people permission (to act on) their prejudice,” said Mabel Menard, president of OCA Chicago, a chapter of OCA, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for civil rights of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.The racism and discrimination accompanying the pandemic comes atop the devastation the disease has had on some portions of the Asian and Pacific Islander community, including health-related business closures and the deaths of at least 67 Filipino registered nurses – a staggering 31% of all nursing deaths, even though Filipinos make up only 4% of registered nurses in the United States, according to National Nurses United. Pacific Islanders rank third in terms of coronavirus deaths, behind Native Americans and Black Americans.More data on Asian hate crimes neededThe San Francisco-based group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks anti-Asian American and Pacific Islander attacks, and other community groups, such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice, based in Washington, D.C., have collectively recorded more than 3,000 anti-Asian attacks nationwide since March, when the COVID-19 pandemic exploded onto U.S. shores. That’s compared to about 100 such incidents that community trackers have recorded annually in the years prior, said Cynthia Choi, 54, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.Because communities of color are often scapegoated during national crises, “we knew it was going to get bad very quickly,” Choi said, “and we wanted to document it in order to understand the severity of it, who was being\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HELEN OH<|>PERSON<|>Helen Oh is an attorney who experienced racism during the COVID-19 pandemic while walking in downtown Denver.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to increased hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TED LIEU<|>PERSON<|>Ted Lieu is a Democratic Representative from California and a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, advocating for the Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States who issued an executive order condemning hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States whose rhetoric during the pandemic has been criticized for inciting racism against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OCA is a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization advocating for the civil rights of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a San Francisco-based group that tracks anti-Asian American and Pacific Islander attacks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL NURSES UNITED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>National Nurses United is an organization that represents registered nurses and has reported on the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Filipino nurses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California where a significant number of anti-Asian incidents have been reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where incidents of violence against Asian Americans have occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in various cities, including San Francisco and New York, where many incidents of anti-Asian violence have been reported.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HELEN OH<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Helen Oh experienced racism linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the impact of the event on individuals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TED LIEU<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Ted Lieu has spoken out about the violence and discrimination faced by Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Joe Biden condemned the hate crimes against Asian Americans that surged during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric during the COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to increased racism against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCA<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>OCA advocates for the civil rights of Asian Americans, particularly in response to the discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Stop AAPI Hate tracks the rise in anti-Asian incidents that have occurred since the COVID-19 pandemic began<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL NURSES UNITED<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>National Nurses United reported on the impact of COVID-19 on Filipino nurses, highlighting the pandemic's effects on the community<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>San Francisco has seen a rise in anti-Asian incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OAKLAND<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Oakland has reported incidents of violence against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Chinatown neighborhoods have been sites of increased violence against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
