As a Korean American, I was used to microaggressions - being\ncomplimented on my English (though I was born and raised in the States), being asked where I really came\nfrom - but this felt different. For the first time in my life, I feared for my physical safety. I feared becoming a\ntarget of violence because of my race.\nSometimes my eyes would well up with tears as I read reports from across the country of Asians and Asian\nAmericans being assaulted, spat on, stabbed and even burned with chemicals by people who associated them\nwith the virus. In early March, only a block away from my Manhattan workplace, a Korean woman was punched\nin the face by a stranger who said \"You've got coronavirus\" and cursed at her; the woman was taken to the\nhospital with a possible dislocated jaw. As the spring went on, I heard about two Asians being stabbed and\nanother getting severely beaten in racially motivated incidents in my Queens neighborhood.\nThe pandemic has made me more aware of racism - how it bubbles beneath the surface of everyday life and can\nerupt at any time, even in a cosmopolitan place like New York. It also has given me a new sense of some of the anxiety that black people face on a regular basis. One mother recently told NPR about how, upon spotting two\nwhite men laughing with one another, her son commented: \"It must be nice to wake up in the morning and feel\nsafe, to not be afraid to go out and do what you have to do for the day, to hang out with your friends, not be\nafraid of the police. I wonder what that is like.\" Though in my case I was more afraid of racist civilians than of\nlaw enforcement, such accounts resonated with me more deeply than before.\nI felt nervous going to my local pharmacy or grocery store, afraid that some malicious stranger might accost me\non the sidewalk and harass or harm me. Before stepping outside to run an errand, I would always weigh the\npotential trade-offs: Do I really need a new jug of milk? Is it worth the risk? When I did venture out, I became\npainfully aware of people's wary glances and nasty stares, or how they walked away when they saw me headed\nin their direction. After only a few months of this, I felt exhausted. What would it feel like to deal with it for a\nlifetime? And what would it feel like to endure not only random, individual confrontations but systemic\ndiscrimination? Anti-black racism influences matters from housing to the air quality in your neighborhood, from\naccess to health care to whether your doctor treats you well. It shapes how you are viewed in professional\nsettings and by police, teachers and bankers. Though the glimpse I got into black people's experience of racism\nwas eye-opening, my understanding of it was still limited.\nAs protests against racial inequality and police brutality gathered in New York and nationwide, I received text\nmessages from some of my Asian friends urging me to stay inside, where it's safe. They told me that Asians\nshould not get involved in these struggles - that these matters didn't concern us. That if violence were to break\nout during the protests, we would end up becoming \"collateral damage.\"\nI understand where they may have been coming from. Asian Americans occupy a murky space in America's\nracial hierarchy: We can't claim white privilege, but we're not consistently or definitively considered people of\ncolor, either, and so sometimes we don't know if we even have the right to raise our voices; we don't know what\nour role in the conversation should be. Some people in my community believe that it's natural for us to stay\ndetached and uninvolved. We're used to being invisible, and that invisibility has often felt safe.\nBut America's racial narrative does involve us. It created the model-minority myth - the notion that Asian\nAmericans are successful because we're hard-working, obedient and don't complain - which many within our\ncommunity bought into over the years. But that myth is not an honest compliment: The U.S. government used\nit to discredit the civil rights movement and to win allies in the Cold War. It's also been wielded against us to\nkeep Asian Americans in line, to prevent us from entering certain professions, and to pit us against black people\nand other people of color. Meanwhile, it was largely because of black activists' efforts during the civil rights\nmovement that the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 was passed, removing immigration quotas based\non national origin and ushering in a wave of Asian immigrants. The Black Power Movement also helped spark\nAsian American advocacy - in fact, the term \"Asian American\" was coined in 1968 by University of California at\nBerkeley students Emma Gee and Yuji Ichioka, who drew inspiration from the Black Power Movement.\nAs sociology professor Anthony C. Ocampo recently told Time magazine, by taking a stand against anti-black\nracism, Asian Americans send an urgent message: \"The same racist logic schemes that are keeping our\ncommunities down might look different in Black communities than they look in Asian American communities, but\nit's still the same system\" - one that puts Asian Americans \"in a position where we can't write our own stories in\nthis country.\" For some Asian Americans, taking a stand has meant attending protests. Others have organized\nfundraisers for racial justice organizations and bail funds. And many have grappled with how to educate our\nrelatives and friends, asking\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KOREAN AMERICAN<|>PERSON<|>A Korean American individual who has experienced microaggressions and fears violence due to rising anti-Asian hate crimes during the coronavirus pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>A cosmopolitan city in the United States where protests against racial inequality and police brutality have occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NPR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>National Public Radio, a media organization that reported on the experiences of a mother regarding her son's feelings of safety in relation to race.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK POWER MOVEMENT<|>EVENT<|>A social movement that inspired Asian American advocacy and the coining of the term \"Asian American\" in 1968.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION ACT OF 1965<|>EVENT<|>A significant piece of legislation that removed immigration quotas based on national origin, allowing a wave of Asian immigrants to enter the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMMA GEE<|>PERSON<|>One of the University of California at Berkeley students who coined the term \"Asian American\" in 1968.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YUJI ICHIOKA<|>PERSON<|>One of the University of California at Berkeley students who coined the term \"Asian American\" in 1968.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTHONY C.
