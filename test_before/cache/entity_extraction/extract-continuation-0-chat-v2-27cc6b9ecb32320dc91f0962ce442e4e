Only 17% of the people polled in October disagreed. The polling also showed 44% of ethnic\nminorities felt BLM increased racial tensions.\nThe findings, which BLM organisers said showed the movement has exposed existing fault lines, comes\nalongside parallel research indicating sharp rises in the number of black people saying they faced discrimination\nin the last year rising from 74% in 2019 to 81%. In a possible sign of racism arising from the origin of Covid-19\nin Wuhan, the proportion of Chinese people saying they faced discrimination over the same period rose from\n68% to 76%, according to polling carried out in June.\nOpinium’s annual survey of multicultural Britain also found that 71% of Asian people had suffered discrimination\nor abuse because of their ethnicity rising to 81% among black people.\n“A particularly worrying find is that the majority of BAME people have faced discrimination because of their race and ethnicity,” said Mete Coban, the director of My Life My Say, a youth-led charity aimed at increasing\nengagement with democracy. “Another saddening finding is that 46% of BAME people have faced discrimination\non multiple occasions, which is an increase from last year.”\nWhite people were more likely to believe the BLM movement, which was given fresh momentum by global\noutrage at the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, had increased racial tensions, Opinium found.\nThose citing that concern most were Conservative voters, with 78% saying they believed it had inflamed\ntensions and just 6% saying it hadn’t.\nRace relations experts point out that senior Conservatives attacked BLM in forthright language, with the former\nchancellor Sajid Javid saying last month it was “neo-Marxist” and “not a force for good”. Kemi Badenoch, the\nequalities minister, has urged schools not to support the “political” movement in teaching.\nAsked about the survey, Adam Elliott-Cooper, a spokesman for BLM, said racial tensions in Britain long preceded\nthe movement and that it had highlighted the issue.\n“To say that to challenge racism increases racial tension is a very misleading assumption,” he said. “Black LivesMatter hasn’t increased racial tension in the same way as the civil rights movement in the US didn’t or the anti-\napartheid movement in South Africa didn’t. They haven’t increased racial tension but they might have made itmore apparent and exposed what is there.”\nThe resurgence of the BLM movement this year triggered a series of actions which many felt were overdue, but\nothers found controversial. These included the into Bristol’s dock and a wave of investigations into British\ninstitutions’ slavery links. A 2017 book by Reni Eddo-Lodge called Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People\nAbout Race,.\nProf Kalwant Bhopal, director of the Centre for Research in Race and Education at the University of Birmingham,\nsaid the results suggested BLM had made some white people “feel their privilege is being threatened and\nquestioned”.\n“When they see something like BLM they do what they can to protect it and there is a backlash,” she said. She\nadded that the response of some institutions, such as universities, to pledge support for the goals of BLM, had\ncreated a “mask of inclusion” which obscured a reluctance to deliver real change. This was seen by some\nminority ethnic people as evidence of division, she said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black Lives Matter (BLM) is an anti-racism movement that gained prominence in the UK, aiming to address and challenge racial injustices and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPINIUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Opinium is a polling organization that conducted a survey regarding public opinion on the BLM movement and racial tensions in the UK.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>PERSON<|>George Floyd was a Black man whose police killing in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked global outrage and renewed momentum for the BLM movement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAJID JAVID<|>PERSON<|>Sajid Javid is a former chancellor who criticized the BLM movement, describing it as “neo-Marxist” and “not a force for good.”)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEMI BADENOCH<|>PERSON<|>Kemi Badenoch is the equalities minister who has urged schools not to support the BLM movement in their teaching.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METE COBAN<|>PERSON<|>Mete Coban is the director of My Life My Say, a youth-led charity focused on increasing engagement with democracy, who commented on the discrimination faced by BAME individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENI EDDO-LODGE<|>PERSON<|>Reni Eddo-Lodge is the author of the book \"Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race,\" which discusses race relations and has contributed to the discourse surrounding BLM.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Birmingham is an educational institution where Prof Kalwant Bhopal works, focusing on research in race and education.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAME<|>EVENT<|>BAME refers to Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic individuals who have reported facing discrimination and racial tensions in the UK.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRISTOL DOCK<|>EVENT<|>The Bristol Dock incident refers to actions taken in response to the BLM movement, including the removal of a statue linked to slavery.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>OPINIUM<|>Opinium conducted a survey that assessed public opinion on the BLM movement and its impact on racial tensions in the UK.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>The killing of George Floyd was a pivotal event that galvanized the BLM movement and increased its visibility and support globally.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAJID JAVID<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>Sajid Javid publicly criticized the BLM movement, indicating a political opposition to its goals and messages.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEMI BADENOCH<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>Kemi Badenoch has expressed opposition to the BLM movement, urging educational institutions to refrain from supporting it.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>METE COBAN<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>Mete Coban commented on the impact of the BLM movement on BAME individuals, highlighting issues of discrimination.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RENI EDDO-LODGE<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>Reni Eddo-Lodge's book contributes to the discourse on race and has been influential in discussions surrounding the BLM movement.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>Prof Kalwant Bhopal from the University of Birmingham provided insights on the societal reactions to the BLM movement and its implications for race relations.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAME<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>The BLM movement has highlighted the discrimination faced by BAME individuals, making their experiences more visible in public discourse.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRISTOL DOCK<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>The Bristol Dock incident was a direct action taken in response to the BLM movement, reflecting its influence on societal attitudes towards historical injustices.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
