However, Montgomery\nCounty surpassed Anne Arundel as the jurisdiction with the highest instance of reports in the state, according to a new\nreport from the Maryland State Police.\nThe State of Maryland 2019 Hate Bias Report shows 81 reports of hate crimes or bias incidents in 2019, up from 78 in\n2018, continuing the trend of increases beginning in 2014. Many of the incidents were reported in the northern part of\nAnne Arundel County, with a heat map showing each zip code by color based on the range of incidents\nreported.Between 12 and 19 incidents reported in Pasadena ZIP code 21122; and between six and 11 incidents reported\nin each of Glen Burnie ZIP codes 21060 and 21061 and in Millersville ZIP code 21108.\nThese numbers include both hate crimes - or a crime motivated by prejudice - and hate bias incidents, which do not rise\nto the level of criminal charges.\nThe report distinguishes incidents as verified, meaning an \"investigation leads a reasonable and prudent person to\nconclude that the offender's actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by their bias\"; inconclusive, meaning the\nevidence is conflicting or incomplete, or unfounded, meaning that evidence or an investigation \"definitively indicates\nthat it was not motivated by bias.\"\nOf Anne Arundel County's 81 reported hate bias incidents, five were verified, 72 were inconclusive and 4 were\nunfounded. Prince George's County accounted for the most verified incidents with 29, 87.9% of the total number of\nreports of incidents in the county.\nHouse Minority Leader Del. Nic Kipke said he thinks it's wrong to assume that Pasadena is more racist than any other\npart of the county because of its incident counts. Perhaps reporting has increased due to increased attention to racial\ndiscrimination over the past few years.\n\"We are trying to stop these types of things from happening,\" Kipke said. \"Our entire community condemns racism, and\nwe are all invested to ensure that those problems end.\"\nCounty and state officials were alarmed after last year's report showed Anne Arundel with the highest numbers of\nreports.\nIn response, County Executive Steuart Pittman moved to treat racism as a public health issue; attended training on\npolicymaking through a racial equity lens; organized an educational hate bias forum in February with the Human\nRelations Commission; established an Office of Health Equity and Racial Justice within the health department; and\namended the county slogan to: \"The best place for all.\"\nThe findings of the report underscore that the county's slogan is aspirational, Pittman said.\nHe said he wouldn't have expected these efforts to curb racism would affect the data immediately but hopes it will make\nthe county a safer and more equitable place for all people.\nHe said that last year's report showing Anne Arundel at the top of the list served as a wake-up call, driving county\nofficials to act. But moving below Montgomery County isn't good news.\n\"I don't celebrate the fact that Montgomery County had more - that's also bad news,\" Pittman said.\nSince state police released this report last year, Pasadena has seen a flurry of activism. Young organizers made it the\nsite of several demonstrations for racial justice over the summer as communities across the nation grappled with\nsystemic racism and police brutality, and hyperlocal groups like One Pasadena have popped up to address racism.\nHarry Freeman, a member of the group's steering committee, said the group was founded after the publication of last\nyear's hate bias report.\nNow, he said, they are trying to remind the community that, \"These are real stories that affect real people.\"\nThe group doesn't view racism along strictly political party lines but as a cultural and historical problem. Nor does the\ngroup view racism purely as a Black versus white issue, Freeman said, noting that Latinos and Asian Americans also\nexperience discrimination.\n\"The thing about racism is that it's not genetic. It's not something you're born with,\" Freeman said. \"You're either\novertly taught to hate, or it's learned.\"\nAcross the state, more than 64% of incidents appear to be motivated by bias related to race, ethnicity or ancestry.\nIn Anne Arundel County, these race motivated incidents include: an effigy hung on the property of the county's first\nBlack councilman last October that was said to be a Halloween stunt, a swastika found at South River High School, or a\nracist video made by students at Northeast High School.\nElementary and secondary schools are the most common location for people to report hate bias incidents across the\nstate, followed closely by homes, according to the report.\nPittman said every incident reported to county police is referred to the Anne Arundel Crisis Response, and victims are\noffered support or connected with counseling services if needed.\nSince last year's report was released, Anne Arundel state legislators strengthened hate crime laws by making it illegal to\nthreaten or intimidate a group or individual with symbols including nooses or swastikas. The legislation was championed\nby Del. Mark Chang, D-Glen Burnie, who is one of the first Korean Americans to be elected to serve in Maryland's\nGeneral Assembly.\nIt passed this year, in a session shortened by the coronavirus pandemic, after two failures during the two previous\nsessions. The new law took effect on Oct. 1.\nIn testimony for the bill, Chang recounted the story of discovering a dead cat hanging from a noose in his yard\nshortly after immigrating to the United States. He was 7, he said, but he\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Anne Arundel County is a jurisdiction in Maryland that reported 81 hate crimes and bias incidents in 2019, showing an increase from the previous year.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONTGOMERY COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Montgomery County is a jurisdiction in Maryland that surpassed Anne Arundel County in the number of reported hate crimes and bias incidents in 2019.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE OF MARYLAND<|>GEO<|>The State of Maryland is the governing body that oversees the reporting and analysis of hate crimes and bias incidents within its jurisdictions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARYLAND STATE POLICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Maryland State Police is the law enforcement agency that compiled and released the 2019 Hate Bias Report.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Prince George's County is a jurisdiction in Maryland that accounted for the most verified hate bias incidents in 2019, with 29 reports.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELEGATE NIC KIPKE<|>PERSON<|>Delegate Nic Kipke is the House Minority Leader who commented on the hate crime reports in Pasadena, Maryland.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEUART PITTMAN<|>PERSON<|>Steuart Pittman is the County Executive of Anne Arundel County who initiated actions to address racism as a public health issue.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Human Relations Commission organized an educational hate bias forum in February to address issues of racism in Anne Arundel County.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONE PASADENA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>One Pasadena is a local group formed to address racism and promote racial justice in Pasadena, Maryland.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARK CHANG<|>PERSON<|>Delegate Mark Chang is a Maryland legislator who championed the new hate crime legislation that took effect on October 1.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HATE BIAS REPORT<|>EVENT<|>The Hate Bias Report is a document released by the Maryland State Police detailing the incidents of hate crimes and bias in the state for the year 2019.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PASADENA<|>GEO<|>Pasadena is a community in Anne Arundel County that reported a significant number of hate crimes and bias incidents in 2019.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY<|>MONTGOMERY COUNTY<|>Montgomery County surpassed Anne Arundel County in the number of reported hate crimes and bias incidents in 2019<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARYLAND STATE POLICE<|>HATE BIAS REPORT<|>The Maryland State Police compiled and released the Hate Bias Report detailing incidents in the state<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY<|>HATE BIAS REPORT<|>Prince George's County had the most verified hate bias incidents reported in the Hate Bias Report<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DELEGATE NIC KIPKE<|>PASADENA<|>Delegate Nic Kipke commented on the hate crime reports specifically mentioning Pasadena<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEUART PITTMAN<|>HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION<|>Steuart Pittman organized an educational hate bias forum in collaboration with the Human Relations Commission<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ONE PASADENA<|>PASADENA<|>One Pasadena is a local group formed in response to the hate bias incidents reported in Pasadena<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARK CHANG<|>HATE BIAS REPORT<|>Mark Chang championed new hate crime legislation following the findings in the Hate Bias Report<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STATE OF MARYLAND<|>HATE BIAS REPORT<|>The State of Maryland oversees the reporting and analysis of hate crimes and bias incidents as detailed in the Hate Bias Report<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
