Navarro, who is Filipino, tried to ignore him, but that soon became impossible.\nThe man walked by, looked back and called Navarro a racial slur. He spat in my direction, and kept walking, Navarro said.\nNavarro, a school nurse in San Francisco, already had anxiety about racism related to the coronavirus, which emerged in China and has Asian people facing unfounded blame and attacks as it's spread worldwide. Now, he was outraged.\nMy first instinct was to yell back at him in anger. But, after taking a breath, I realized that would have put me in danger, Navarro said.\nInstead, he took to Twitter last week to turn the ugly moment into an opportunity for a conversation about racism, generating thousands of sympathetic comments.\nAsian Americans are using social media to organize and fight back against racially motivated attacks during the pandemic, which the FBI predicts will increase as infections grow. A string of racist run-ins in the last two weeks has given rise to hashtags - #WashTheHate, #RacismIsAVirus, #IAmNotCOVID19 - and online forums to report incidents. Critics say President Donald Trump made things worse by calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus.\nFor a group with a history of being scapegoated - from Japanese Americans detained during World War II to a Chinese American man killed by autoworkers angry about Japanese competition in the '80s - there's urgency to drown out both bigotry and apathy.\nTo that end, the California-based groups Chinese for Affirmative Action and the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council set up a hate reporting center last month. New York's attorney general also launched a hotline.\nWe kind of just knew from history this was going to snowball, said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action. With the rising stress and anxiety, we knew we'd see a rise in hate incidents.\nThe center has fielded more than 1,000 reports from across the U.S., ranging from people spitting to throwing bottles from cars. An FBI report distributed to local law enforcement predicts the attacks will surge and pointed to the stabbing of an Asian American man and his two children at a Sam's Club in Texas last month, ABC News reported. According to the report, the 19-year-old suspect said he thought they were infecting people. The victims have recovered.\nAmid the explosive climate, former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang drew backlash for urging fellow Asian Americans to display more American-ness. In a Washington Post editorial Wednesday, he called on them to avoid confrontation and do acts of goodwill like volunteering and helping neighbors.\nBeing 'the good Asian' has not fared well for Asian Americans, Choi said. We don't have to prove our worth and that we belong, that we're exceptional. And we certainly don't have to believe that this is something that we should ignore.\nYang's spokesman declined to comment.\nMeanwhile, Trump has walked back on calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus, saying at a media briefing and on Twitter last week that Asian Americans should not be blamed in any way, shape or form.\nDemocrats in the U.S. Senate and House worry the damage has been done and have introduced resolutions to condemn anti-Asian racism.\nHis followers continue to double-down on that term, said U.S. Rep. Judy Chu of California, chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.\nSome of the reports received by the advocacy groups describe harassment that appears to parrot Trump, Choi said.\nA White House spokesman declined to comment and referred to Trump's remarks at the March 23 briefing.\nThe president's words also drew some Asian Americans in entertainment and fashion to the #WashTheHate social media campaign last month. Celia Au, star of the Netflix show Wu Assassins, and others posted videos showing them washing their hands and talking about the effect of racism.\n   It comes from the top down at the end of the day, Au said. Our top leader is not doing the job, so it's time for us to step up.\nPeople turning against Asian Americans in an uncertain time and sputtering economy echoes the climate in 1982, when Vincent Chin was killed in Detroit as laid-off autoworkers blamed a recession on Japanese competition.\nAt that time, I knew I had to watch out and be careful - who I was around, how they looked at me, said Helen Zia, a Chinese American author and journalist from Oakland, California, who lived in Detroit at the time. I think we're in that stage now.\nTwo white autoworkers beat Chin to death with a bat outside a strip club during his bachelor party simply because they thought he was Japanese. The 27-year-old's attackers were convicted of manslaughter and got just three years of probation.\nZia said she and others contacted advocacy groups, churches and Chinese-language media about protesting the sentence. Relying only on mail and telephones, they found allies in the NAACP and Anti-Defamation League and launched demonstrations nationwide.\nIt was a watershed moment, Zia said. We were drowning, and we had to organize to change what we saw going on around us.\nThanks to social media, younger generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are speaking up during what could be another seminal moment. Choi hopes they will rally non-Asians to see the wave of racist attacks in the COVID-19 era as their issue, too. Groups like the NAACP and Council on American-Islamic Relations have condemned anti- Asian rhetoric.\nWith attacks escalating, Zia can't help but fear the pandemic could result in another tragedy like Chin's death.\nThe level of anger ... it's already here, Zia said. For Asian Americans, there's the virus of COVID-19 and there's the virus of hate\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KYLE NAVARRO<|>PERSON<|>Kyle Navarro is a Filipino school nurse in San Francisco who experienced a racially charged incident while unlocking his bicycle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California where Kyle Navarro works as a school nurse.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWITTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Twitter is a social media platform where Kyle Navarro shared his experience to raise awareness about racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action is a California-based group that set up a hate reporting center in response to rising anti-Asian incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC PLANNING AND POLICY COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council is a California-based organization that collaborates with Chinese for Affirmative Action to address hate incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDREW YANG<|>PERSON<|>Andrew Yang is a former Democratic presidential candidate who urged Asian Americans to display more American-ness during the rise of anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States who referred to COVID-19 as the Chinese virus, contributing to anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUDY CHU<|>PERSON<|>Judy Chu is a U.S. Representative from California and chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, who is concerned about anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>PERSON<|>Vincent Chin was a Chinese American man killed in 1982, whose death became a pivotal moment in the fight against anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HELEN ZIA<|>PERSON<|>Helen Zia is a Chinese American author and journalist from Oakland, California, who was involved in activism following Vincent Chin's death.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAACP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The NAACP is a civil rights organization that has condemned anti-Asian rhetoric and supported advocacy efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNCIL ON AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Council on American-Islamic Relations is an organization that has condemned anti-Asian rhetoric during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has led to increased racism and scapegoating of Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYLE NAVARRO<|>TWITTER<|>Kyle Navarro used Twitter to share his experience of racism and raise awareness about the issue<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYLE NAVARRO<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Kyle Navarro is a school nurse working in San Francisco, where he experienced a racially charged incident<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>ASIAN PACIFIC PLANNING AND POLICY COUNCIL<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action and the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council collaborated to set up a hate reporting center<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDREW YANG<|>KYLE NAVARRO<|>Andrew Yang's comments about Asian Americans relate to the experiences shared by Kyle Navarro regarding racism<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>KYLE NAVARRO<|>Donald Trump's labeling of COVID-19 as the Chinese virus contributed to the racism that Kyle Navarro faced<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUDY CHU<|>KYLE NAVARRO<|>Judy Chu's advocacy against anti-Asian racism is relevant to the experiences of individuals like Kyle Navarro<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>HELEN ZIA<|>Helen Zia was involved in activism following the death of Vincent Chin, which is a historical reference in the context of anti-Asian racism<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAACP<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>The NAACP has supported the efforts of Chinese for Affirmative Action in combating anti-Asian racism<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COUNCIL ON AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>The Council on American-Islamic Relations has condemned anti-Asian rhetoric alongside the efforts of Chinese for Affirmative Action<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>KYLE NAVARRO<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated racism against Asian Americans, impacting individuals like Kyle Navarro<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
