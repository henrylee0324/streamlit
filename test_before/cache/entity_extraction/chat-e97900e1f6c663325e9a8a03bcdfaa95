In a separate post, Abdul Halim claimed that Chinese people do not wash properly after defecating and were not as hygienic as Muslims, causing the virus to spread. Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam slammed the comments as \"silly\", \"xenophobic\" and \"thoroughly racist\" and is \"quite unacceptable from anyone, let alone someone who is supposed to be a religious teacher\".\nEven in England, on February 12, 2020, Sky News reported that some Chinese people in the United Kingdom said they were facing increasing levels of racist abuse; Chinese businesses in the United Kingdom, including the busy Chinese Takeaway segment and businesses in China Town, London recorded significantly reduced customers in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak compared to usual elevated sales related to Chinese New year celebrations, due to fears of coronavirus spreading through food or unhygienic working practices.\nAlso in America, there have been reports of over 1,000 xenophobia and racism cases against Asian Americans between January 28 and February 24, 2020, which was during the first COVID-19 cases that were reported in the United States. Media critique organization 'FAIR' has documented instances of anti-Asian racism on the street, and states that many US (as well as UK) media outlets capitalize on Sinophobia and \"Orientalist tropes\" that the Chinese are inherently sneaky and untrustworthy, and are ruled by an incompetent, authoritarian government that is the 'sick man of Asia'\".\nMoreover, US President Donald Trump's frequent references to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus\" has been criticized as anti- Chinese and racist, as well as diversionary. Trump continued to use this phrase despite criticism from Democratic legislators as well as Asian American advocates and Public health experts, who said that the use of the phrase inflamed tensions and cited a surge in attacks on Asian Americans. Scott Kennedy, an expert at the center for strategic and international studies, said that Trump's use of the phrase fueled a narrative relating not only to the Chinese Communist Party \"but of China and Chinese people in general\" and was \"xenophobic and tinged with racist overtones,\" especially given the Trump administration's past statements and actions.\nTo conclude, hope that the world will soon surmount the ongoing pandemic but the pandemic of xenophobia launched particularly against Chinese people and generally against the people of East Asian and South Asian descent, if not inhibited earnestly, would continue to haunt the generations to come and thereby jeopardize the peace of the world.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
