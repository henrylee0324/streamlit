Even before the\npandemic, Asian Americans were routinely assaulted, spat upon, and told to “go back home,” but seldom chose\nto report these incidents. The pandemic has simply made visible what had been largely invisible, though\nskepticism remains as to whether these truly qualify as racially motivated attacks.\nIf we in the Asian community want to reduce our exposure to hate crimes, we must overcome our tendency to\nremain silent. We must let the world know what we were experiencing long before COVID-19 began making\nheadlines.\nAs a researcher who studies the self-reflective process of metacognition and someone of Asian descent, it’s clear\nto me that underreporting of racially motivated attacks on Asian Americans happens, at least in part, because\nthe victims are caught between American individualism and Asian collectivism. Too often, the Asian self prevails\nand the victim fails to report the crime for the “good” of the group.\nMetacognition, which develops in childhood, refers to our ability to understand and reflect on our own thought\nprocesses. It has also been identified as a form of “privileged access,” where my own thoughts are private,\nknown only to me. Asian Americans tend to embrace this privacy. But why? For many immigrants, assimilation\nis a life-long goal. Given differences in our appearances, habits, and speech, our strategy for successful\nassimilation has been anonymity. We even refuse to let our facial expressions betray our emotions. A high\nschool teacher once announced that my nickname would be “poker face.” At the time, this didn’t feel like an insult; I took pride in the accomplishment of bluffing, and thus assimilating.\nIn America, people want access to others’ personal stories, including their challenges and hardships. Intimate\ndetails about people’s lives, including their private thoughts, are commodified in published memoirs. When I was\nwriting my book on metacognition (in Korean), I was told, “Don’t get personal!” When I (cautiously) posted on\nsocial media about my issues with the former administration, I heard the inevitable, “Be careful.” And, now, as I\nwrite this piece, I put myself at risk of hearing what I fear most: “Sit this one out.” But I can’t sit this out\nanymore. I, too, have seen the videos of the attacks, and it hits too close to home. The faces of the victims are\nour parents, our grandparents, and our elders. The victims are those who have sacrificed their own culture to\nhelp us find acceptance into the American culture. We need to speak up.\nBut it’s still not easy. Like most Asians, I am embarrassingly comfortable behind a mask. In February of 2020,\n“anonymous me” stuck out like a sore thumb as I got on the train after work. I was the only Asian in sight, and\nthe only person wearing a mask. A few weeks later, even after discussions of mask-wearing had begun, I was\nthe only masked individual in my local, very crowded, Shop-Rite. At the check-out, I told the person behind me\nto please move back a little. She refused and scowled at me. I spoke to no one about this, but have not set foot\ninside a supermarket since.\nThe pandemic has made the particularities of Asian American culture more salient. While anonymity was once\nour superpower, it’s now our curse. As the earliest and most consistent maskers, we become outsiders,\nforeigners, and carriers of deadly diseases like the “Kung Flu virus.” At the same time, skepticism about our\ncondition is on the rise. Stereotypically, we seem not to suffer in the classroom or in the economy. We tend not\nto complain, so attacks on us can’t really be that serious, can they?\nWhat remains unseen is easily believed not to exist, and while we cling to our anonymity the abuse remains\ninvisible. We cannot address anti-Asian violence in America until we first “see” that it exists. This means opening\nup collectively about our individual experiences with racism. But it also means understanding and battling the\nracism faced by others in our society, including racism that comes from within our community. It means finding\nways in which to increase our nation’s cultural intelligence. From a metacognitive perspective, I want us to find\nways to balance our Asian and American identities, which starts with trusting ourselves. I will begin with myself.\nAs I don my mask and reflect, I pledge to make myself more visible in the fight against hate.About the Author:\nLisa Son is a Korean American psychology professor at Barnard College of Columbia University.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LISA SON<|>PERSON<|>Lisa Son is a Korean American psychology professor at Barnard College of Columbia University, who writes about the experiences of Asian Americans and the impact of racism.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BARNARD COLLEGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Barnard College is a women's liberal arts college in New York City, affiliated with Columbia University, where Lisa Son teaches.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Columbia University is an Ivy League research university located in New York City, which is affiliated with Barnard College.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are individuals of Asian descent living in the United States, who have faced various forms of racism and discrimination.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that began in late 2019, which has exacerbated issues of racism against Asian Americans.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ANTI-ASIAN VIOLENCE<|>EVENT<|>Anti-Asian violence refers to racially motivated attacks and discrimination against individuals of Asian descent, particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic.)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LISA SON<|>BARNARD COLLEGE<|>Lisa Son is a psychology professor at Barnard College, contributing to the academic community and discussing issues related to Asian Americans.<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BARNARD COLLEGE<|>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY<|>Barnard College is affiliated with Columbia University, sharing resources and academic programs.<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LISA SON<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Lisa Son writes about the experiences and challenges faced by Asian Americans, particularly in the context of racism and violence.<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>ANTI-ASIAN VIOLENCE<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in anti-Asian violence, as highlighted in discussions about racism during this period.<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>ANTI-ASIAN VIOLENCE<|>Asian Americans are the primary victims of anti-Asian violence, which has been exacerbated by societal attitudes during the pandemic.<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
