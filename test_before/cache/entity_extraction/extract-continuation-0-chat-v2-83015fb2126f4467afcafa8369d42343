Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said it was \"important\" to condemn the hate incidents, even if it was \"symbolic.\" But as the incidents continued to rise, \"it's time to take it to the next level to make sure that we are using all the tools in our toolbox to help curb this problem,\" she said.That includes legislation.Democratic lawmakers said they would introduce a new bill addressing a rise in hate incidents directed at Asian Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic. The bill, a revised version of legislation introduced but not passed in the last Congress, would create a new position at the Department of Justice to facilitate the review of hate crimes and provide oversight of hate crimes related to COVID-19.Meng, the lead sponsor of the legislation in the House, told USA TODAY the bill would make it \"easier for us to have a more complete and accurate picture\" of hate crimes and incidents.Among other provisions, it would issue guidance for state and local law enforcement agencies to establish their own hate crime reporting systems and education campaigns about hate crimes, provided in multiple languages.More: Hate crimes against Asian Americans are on the rise. Here's what activists, lawmakers and police are doing to stop the violenceMore: 'Stop killing us': Attacks on Asian Americans highlight rise in hate incidents amid COVID-19\"We want to continue to not only raise awareness, but also to try to help find real long-term solutions,\" Meng said.Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, is spearheading the Senate's version of the legislation.\"Prosecution is really important, but I think it's also important for leaders to say ... this is unacceptable and to condemn this kind of targeting of (Asian American Pacific Islanders) and in fact the targeting of any minority group to this kind of assaults and attacks,\" she said.She told USA TODAY the bill would likely pass the Democratic-controlled House, but \"we shall see\" whether it could gain traction in the Senate, where at least 10 Republicans would need to join all Democrats to block a procedural roadblock known as a filibuster.Meng believes there is \"more momentum\" this year to pass the legislation and is confident President Joe Biden's administration would be a better partner on addressing anti-Asian American hate incidents than the Trump administration.Lawmakers and advocates say the derisive language used to describe the pandemic by some politicians, including former President Donald Trump, helped inflame the anti-Asian American sentiment.\"This is an administration that actually cares about this and does not go around making things worse by calling\" the coronavirus derisive names, Hirono said.Biden's administration has issued executive orders addressing the hate incidents, and lawmakers from the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a group of lawmakers representing the interests of Asian Americans, have requested a meeting with the administration to discuss the orders' implementation, though the meeting has not yet been scheduled.Advocates have sounded the alarm on recent violent attacks against Asian Americans, including the killing of 84-year-old Thai American Vicha Ratanapakdee, and a recent increase in violence against senior citizens across the country.Although Asian American communities had been told to report hate incidents in the past, Meng said recent events made it clear to her \"obviously, that's not happening. And it's not happening at an accurate enough level.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that tracks discrimination against Asian and Pacific Island Americans, reporting over 3,000 incidents of anti-Asian harassment or attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRACE MENG<|>PERSON<|>Grace Meng is a Democratic Representative from New York who has been vocal about condemning anti-Asian hate incidents and is the lead sponsor of legislation addressing these issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAZIE HIRONO<|>PERSON<|>Mazie Hirono is a Democratic Senator from Hawaii who is spearheading the Senate's version of the legislation aimed at addressing hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States, whose administration is seen as a better partner in addressing anti-Asian American hate incidents compared to the previous administration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States, whose use of derisive language regarding the coronavirus is believed to have inflamed anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old Thai American who was killed in a violent attack, highlighting the rise in violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Department of Justice is a federal executive department responsible for the enforcement of the law and administration of justice, which would facilitate the review of hate crimes as proposed in the new legislation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONGRESSIONAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN CAUCUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus is a group of lawmakers representing the interests of Asian Americans, advocating for legislation to address hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRACE MENG<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Grace Meng has been vocal in condemning anti-Asian hate incidents and supports the work of Stop AAPI Hate in tracking these incidents<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAZIE HIRONO<|>GRACE MENG<|>Mazie Hirono and Grace Meng are both involved in legislative efforts to address hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>GRACE MENG<|>Grace Meng believes that Joe Biden's administration would be a better partner in addressing anti-Asian American hate incidents<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ANTI-ASIAN SENTIMENT<|>Donald Trump's language during his presidency is believed to have inflamed anti-Asian sentiment, contributing to the rise in hate incidents<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>ANTI-ASIAN VIOLENCE<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee's killing is an example of the recent violent attacks against Asian Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE<|>GRACE MENG<|>Grace Meng's proposed legislation would create a new position at the Department of Justice to facilitate the review of hate crimes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONGRESSIONAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN CAUCUS<|>JOE BIDEN<|>The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus has requested a meeting with Joe Biden's administration to discuss the implementation of executive orders addressing hate incidents<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
