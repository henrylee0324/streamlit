She also suggests people allocate some time during the day to process their worries, perhaps via expressive writing in journals.\n\"That way some of the tension is released during the day itself.\" At MindPeers, Agarwal's team of psychologists often ask their clients to draw their palm on a paper and write all the things they can control within the palm and those out of their control outside the palm. It gives them perspective and a direction to tackle their worries, she says. A lot of people are also finding solace in the fact that they're not alone in this, that many people are battling insomnia at present.\nMost therapists are also actively discouraging clients from using sleep trackers during this period if too much information about their sleep cycle overwhelms them. The makers of certain sleep trackers propagate this, too. \"If users express anxiety over tracking their sleep, we advise them to go scrap trackers and concentrate on how they feel in the morning. That is the best sleep quality score you will ever get,\" says Carl Johan Hederoth, CEO, Sleep Cycle, that has over 5 million Android installs.\nEven Malaviya in Gurgaon has chosen not to get hassled by her sleep tracker's results anymore. \"When you look back at the many difficult things you have gone through in life, it doesn't feel as hard now as it did then,\" she says, hoping that it will be the same this time around, too.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HEADSPACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Headspace is a popular app designed for mindfulness and meditation, with over 10 million downloads on Android.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROWNING<|>PERSON<|>Browning is the CEO and cofounder of Headspace, guiding clients on breathing techniques to help them calm down.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINDPEERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MindPeers is an organization where psychologists help clients manage their worries through various techniques.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGARWAL<|>PERSON<|>Agarwal is a psychologist at MindPeers who employs creative methods to help clients gain perspective on their worries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLEEP CYCLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sleep Cycle is an app that tracks sleep patterns and has over 5 million downloads on Android.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARL JOHAN HEDEROTH<|>PERSON<|>Carl Johan Hederoth is the CEO of Sleep Cycle, advising users on how to approach sleep tracking without anxiety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GURGAON<|>GEO<|>Gurgaon is a city where individuals like Malaviya are managing their sleep-related anxieties.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALAVIYA<|>PERSON<|>Malaviya is an individual from Gurgaon who has chosen to not be affected by her sleep tracker's results.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROWNING<|>HEADSPACE<|>Browning is the CEO and cofounder of Headspace, directly linking her to the organization she leads.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGARWAL<|>MINDPEERS<|>Agarwal works at MindPeers, providing psychological support to clients, establishing a direct relationship with the organization.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARL JOHAN HEDEROTH<|>SLEEP CYCLE<|>Carl Johan Hederoth is the CEO of Sleep Cycle, indicating a strong connection to the organization he leads.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MALAVIYA<|>GURGAON<|>Malaviya resides in Gurgaon, establishing a geographical connection to the city.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROWNING<|>AGARWAL<|>Browning and Agarwal are both involved in mental health and wellness, linking them through their professional focus.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGARWAL<|>BROWNING<|>Agarwal works under Browning at Headspace, creating a professional relationship between them.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MALAVIYA<|>AGARWAL<|>Malaviya may seek guidance from Agarwal at MindPeers, establishing a client-therapist relationship.<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
