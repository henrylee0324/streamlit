Also in May, two lion statues at the entrance to the city's Chinatown were defaced twice with racist graffiti.\nDiscrimination has been stoked by the use of terms such as \"Chinese virus\" and \"Wuhan virus\" by senior figures in the United States, including President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. While Trump dropped references to the \"Chinese virus\" in late March, he has recently returned to racially charged terms like \"kung flu\" and \"Chinese flu\" at his campaign events.\nThe survey found two-thirds of respondents felt coverage from North American news outlets had led to negative views of Chinese-Canadians, while three in 10 said they were frequently exposed to racist graffiti or messaging on social media.\nA quarter said they were treated with less respect because of their Chinese ethnicity and a similar share said they were made to feel as though they posed a threat to the health and safety of their fellow Canadians.\nOne man in his 60s told the survey team he had been spat at by a cyclist, while a woman in her 20s said: \"Walking down the street with a mask on, there have been instances where people will scream at me to go back to China or swear and say other racist remarks. I look Chinese but I am not from China, even though I have Chinese heritage. Makes it all very confusing.\"\nAnother respondent, a woman in her 30s, said she had been repeatedly yelled at in the streets of her neighbourhood.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
