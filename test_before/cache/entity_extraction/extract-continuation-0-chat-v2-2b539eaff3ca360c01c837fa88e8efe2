For visual designer Cao Siyu, the answer is often\na simple one, and it can usually be found in her comics, which highlight cultural differences and connections\nbased on her experiences and observations while living abroad.\nBorn and raised in Beijing, Cao, 32, left home at 20 to study in the United States for her bachelor's degree in\nEnglish literature and, later, the United Kingdom for her master's degree in graphic design. She now runs a\nvisual thinking workshop in Paris. Visual thinking is defined as \"any mental process based on the visual\nprocessing capabilities of the mind\", a common mode of thinking alongside verbal, kinesthetic, musical and\nmathematical thinking.\n\"My experience shows that although travel is much easier and faster today, the distance between cultures\ndoesn't shorten,\" Cao says, adding that she wants to build a bridge and break the stereotypes between different\ncultures.\n\"After staying in three countries, I have much to tell about the usual shock while adapting to life in new\ncultures, so I started drawing the web comic to share my experiences and observations as a Chinese person\nliving abroad,\" Cao says, adding that after 12 years overseas, she can understand situations from both sides.\nAfter she encountered many misunderstandings and came face to face with stereotypical views, about China,\nCao was inspired to create Tiny Eyes Comics, an internet-based cartoon strip illustrating the \"big world through\ntiny Chinese eyes\".Since her first illustration in late 2016, Cao has posted more than 300 comics to her\nInstagram account, which has attracted about 41,000 followers.\nFocusing on everyday topics, including family relationships, food, different ways of thinking and social customs,\nCao's comics feature a girl named Tiny Eyes and portray her life in a lighthearted way.\n\"Although Tiny Eyes looks similar to me, she is not me. She can be anyone who feels related to the experience,\"\nCao says, adding that the comics can shed light on China for foreigners who are curious about the country.\nA book of the Tiny Eyes comics was published in France in May last year and an English version is currently in\nproduction.\nIts French publisher Equateur says about the book: \"In a few strokes, Siyu Cao produces scenes of everyday life\n¡• and challenges the prejudices and representations we make of each other, deconstructing them with personal\nanecdotes.\"\nItalian magazine Grazia says: \"Her simple sketches have played a big part in demystifying Chinese culture.\"\nHer comic creation has continued and COVID-19 has made her realize how important it is to help people from\ndifferent cultural backgrounds to communicate with each other. Using her pencil, she hopes that her drawings\ncan help people stay connected in a socially-distanced world.\nOne of her comics shows the cultural differences behind the debate about usage of masks, which has been a\ndivisive topic throughout the pandemic. To wear or not to wear, that is the question that has led to unexpected\ncontroversy and, in some cases, even physical conflict, in some parts of the world.\nAt the beginning of the outbreak, Cao heard a case about an Asian woman in France wearing a mask being\ninsulted and expelled from a train by other passengers.\nIn a bid to illustrate the cultural approach to the wearing of masks, she posted a comic strip illustrating a\nChinese girl wearing a mask on the metro being stared at weirdly by others. In the strip she explains that\nChinese people wear masks to prevent infection, as well as avoid passing the virus to others, especially since\nthe SARS outbreak in 2002-03, while before April, the French were encouraged to wear a mask only when\nshowing coronavirus symptoms.\nAs France has witnessed a record high COVID-19 surge in recent months, several cities, including Paris and\nNice, last month made masks mandatory.\n\"The wearing of masks is just one example of a cultural difference that can trigger tension, even discrimination,\nduring the pandemic,\" she says.\nMany people around the world have commented on the post. An Instagram user named Carjoyflo said:\n\"Fascinating cultural difference. That helps explain it - I have a number of Chinese international students at my\nCalifornia school who are wearing masks.\" Another user, Vagabondying, said: \"Exactly the same in Italy. Very\nwell explained.\"\nOne of her popular illustrations shows how complicated French cutlery compares to the Chinese tradition of\nusing chopsticks. Chinese people can use chopsticks to eat everything, but in France, there are no less than\neight types of fork, knife and spoon required to finish a single, multiple-course meal.\nAnother culinary difference between Chinese and Westerners is hot water. In her illustration, no matter if it is\nwinter or summer, in a French restaurant, sparkling water is always served before the meal; in the US, the default is usually water with ice; while in China, people drink hot water a lot, because unprocessed tap water\nis undrinkable and people believe that hot water is good for the health.\nBesides food culture, she also covers expressions of love in her comics. Although emotions are universal, how\nto express them differs between East and West. In her illustrations, while an American professes love for her\nmother directly over the phone, Tiny Eyes displays the same sentiment by asking after the health of her loved\nones and buying nice things to make their life more comfortable.\nMany foreign readers say they find her illustrations enlightening, helping them to understand China, while\nChinese immigrants have felt seen and understood\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CAO SIYU<|>PERSON<|>Cao Siyu is an overseas Chinese artist and visual designer known for her online comic strip that deconstructs cultural stereotypes between East and West.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TINY EYES COMICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tiny Eyes Comics is an internet-based cartoon strip created by Cao Siyu that illustrates cultural differences and connections based on her experiences living abroad.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS<|>GEO<|>Paris is the city in France where Cao Siyu runs her visual thinking workshop.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEIJING<|>GEO<|>Beijing is the city in China where Cao Siyu was born and raised.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is the country where Cao Siyu studied for her bachelor's degree in English literature.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>GEO<|>The United Kingdom is the country where Cao Siyu pursued her master's degree in graphic design.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is the pandemic that has influenced cultural discussions and practices, including the wearing of masks, as illustrated in Cao Siyu's comics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQUATEUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Equateur is the French publisher of the Tiny Eyes comics book.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAZIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Grazia is an Italian magazine that has commented on Cao Siyu's work, noting its role in demystifying Chinese culture.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAO SIYU<|>TINY EYES COMICS<|>Cao Siyu is the creator of Tiny Eyes Comics, which reflects her experiences and cultural observations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAO SIYU<|>PARIS<|>Cao Siyu runs her visual thinking workshop in Paris, where she currently resides<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAO SIYU<|>BEIJING<|>Cao Siyu was born and raised in Beijing, which influences her cultural perspective<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAO SIYU<|>UNITED STATES<|>Cao Siyu studied in the United States, which contributed to her understanding of Western culture<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAO SIYU<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>Cao Siyu pursued her master's degree in graphic design in the United Kingdom, further shaping her artistic approach<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>TINY EYES COMICS<|>Cao Siyu's comics address cultural differences highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly regarding mask-wearing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EQUATEUR<|>TINY EYES COMICS<|>Equateur is the publisher of the Tiny Eyes comics book, promoting Cao Siyu's work<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAZIA<|>TINY EYES COMICS<|>Grazia has featured Cao Siyu's work, acknowledging its impact on cultural understanding<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
