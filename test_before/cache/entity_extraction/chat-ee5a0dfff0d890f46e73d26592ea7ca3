An attendee began the ceremonies by blasting a shofar, the trumpet made out of a ram's horn.\nSomebody played keyboard. And a long line of people waited to speak into a microphone about their memories of Angeli\nDemus. |The lifelong Chicagoan, who had died a month earlier at age 59, insisted she didn't want it called a funeral.\n\"Donate, cremate, celebrate,\" had been her credo to her family near the end of a gutting battle with lung cancer, and with\nher eyes donated and her body cremated, all that was left was this party. |Her husband, Earl Demus, billed it as \"Angeli's\nJoyous Celebration,\" and thought that the crowd it gathered spoke to his wife's beloved nature. \"Standing room only,\"\nrecounted Demus, who estimated there were more than 450 people there. \"I stopped counting after a while.\"\nThe disconcerting news story that seemed recently to creep into every conversation, particularly after it tanked the stock\nmarket the previous week, didn't make it past the doors of the church. Nobody wore a mask or kept their distance, and for\nthe most part nobody even talked about the novel coronavirus. It had only started to trickle into the United States, as far\nas anybody knew, and the few cases in Illinois were said to be isolated and controlled.\nA top health official had a week earlier assured Chicagoans that \"the health risk to the general public from novel\ncoronavirus remains low,\" and the outlook from the highest levels of government was that, nationally, the few instances of\nthe virus were disappearing. President Donald Trump had said three days earlier there were 15 cases in the country, and\n\"the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.\"\nIn a room off to the side of the church, people sipped soft drinks and picked at a spread catered by a neighborhood chef:\nfinger sandwiches, sliders, fruit and cheese, chicken and Angeli's favorite dessert, cheesecake. This room was where her\nfather, Charles Dungill, spent most of the event.\nEverybody called him \"Cookie,\" a throwback to his days as a drummer in a family band that toured everywhere Black\nperformers were allowed in Jim Crow's America. Cookie shook hands, hugged and chatted with relatives and friends, some\nof whom had traveled from California, Michigan, Georgia, Ohio and Nevada. A family friend was fresh off a golfing trip to\nArizona and another had recently returned from South Africa.\nIt was the West Chatham diaspora, a testament to the lasting bonds of the tight-knit Chicago neighborhood in which\nCookie and his wife, Barbara, had raised Angeli and her three surviving siblings: brothers Sevil and Kyann, and sister Gina.\nA couple of days after the celebration at the church, Sevil stopped by Cookie's house to check on him. The kids were\nworried about their dad. They'd noticed little changes in his appearance: a slight droop to his posture, something different\nin his eyes.\nIt wasn't just his daughter's death with which he was reckoning. Barbara, his wife of 63 years, had died less than a week\nbefore Angeli's celebration, after suffering from multiple ailments, including cancer.\nBut Sevil found his dad in good enough spirits, having enjoyed the event at Pullman so much that he wanted to plan the\nsame thing for Barbara. Father and son chatted for about three hours, during which Sevil noticed that his dad had a slight\nhitch in his throat.\nProbably post-nasal drip.\nThe next day after work, Sevil was driving back to his dad's house, bringing him Barbara's ashes from the crematorium,\nwhen he realized: Now he had a little cough, too.\n\"You know, just a hee-mmh,\" Sevil later recalled.\n***\nBefore the nearly 300,000 deaths, the widespread financial devastation, the isolation from loved ones and the fatigue of a\ndaily disaster with no clear end, there was this: A tickle in a throat in Chicago. A woman's sudden crash to the floor of her\nkitchen in the Bay Area. A playwright in Manhattan with three-quarters of a lung left in his chest, sensing doom and fleeing\ndown the coast with his husband.\nThe virus shouldn't have been able to sneak up on the United States. The world's most powerful nation, historically among\nthe most successful at stymieing infectious illnesses, had ample lead time during which the deadly pandemic was\nrampaging through Asia, and then Europe.\nBut in an early vacuum of leadership at almost every government level, with the message from the White House that the\nvirus was not anything to worry about, Americans unwittingly spread the lethal virus to loved ones and strangers alike.\nThe U.S. squandered its early advantage. Roughly one year after the virus first came into existence, the country has\nsuffered a loss of life far worse than any other.\nDr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and professor at Brown University, said COVID-19's traits made it a formidable\nopponent for even those large nations most competent at fighting it.\nBut, she added, in the United States in 2020, the virus found an ideal victim. \"The virus could not have emerged at a\nbetter time for spread than this year,\" Ranney said. \"We were in an election year. We had a president who didn't believe in\nscience. We had underfunding of our public health institutions. It was a perfect storm.\"\nIn an effort to better understand how the virus exploited\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
