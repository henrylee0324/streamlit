It is the same for her patients.\nMs. Wiatrowski cannot bring families in to hold hands during the last breaths. She cannot wrap her arms around those who are in grief. She cannot help them get a talisman,\nlike a lock of hair or an EKG strip.\n\"I can't even give them a piece of paper with their heartbeat without feeling like it's contaminated. Now everything feels contaminated.\"\n-- Mike Baker\nBerkeley, Calif.\nIn the manner of academic scientists during normal times, at the end of a day that was light years from normal, Enrique Lin Shiao led with the data.\nNever mind that the prestigious University of California, Berkeley, biology laboratory where he is a postdoctoral fellow was shuttered for regular research studies. Or that Dr. Lin\nShiao, 31, was presenting his results to disembodied colleagues in a Slack channel as he ate dinner.\nWhat mattered was that providing the data to the Food and Drug Administration was a prerequisite for clearance to perform much-needed clinical tests for the new coronavirus.\nAnd the data was good.\n\"Awesome work,\" typed Jennifer Doudna, a Berkeley professor who runs the Innovative Genomics Institute, as she studied Dr. Lin Shiao's graphs from her living room.\nThe dearth of tests available to Americans who may be infected has anguished molecular biologists, whose research routinely invokes the basic procedure used to detect virus\ngenes in a patient's nasal swab.\nDr. Doudna, the co-developer of a gene-editing tool called CRISPR, has transformed the first floor of her institute into a testing center that aims to process at least 1,000\nsamples a day. But first, the group needed to show the F.D.A. the lowest level of virus its test could detect.\nAs some of Dr. Lin Shiao's colleagues appended congratulatory \"clapping\" and \"on fire\" icons to the charts that indicated the test was highly sensitive, others looked ahead, to\nwhen they would begin again.\n-- Amy Harmon\nNew York\nThe sky over Central Park was slate gray, with pinpoints of stars dim amid the city's stubborn glow.\nThe East Meadow, its lush grass preserved by fences and \"Keep Off\" signs for an anticipated summer of sun tanning and picnics, was instead bathed in a sea of white medical\ntents brought by truck from North Carolina to aid the city's overwhelmed hospitals.\nThe tents -- 14 in all -- were empty, save for 68 portable metal beds, neatly laid with identical white sheets and pillows.\nSamaritan's Purse, a Christian charity, drove in its own supplies. Once the field hospital gets final administrative approval from health department officials to operate, the city\nwill supply the patients.\nIn the I.C.U. tent, there were 10 beds, each accompanied by the most desired piece of medical equipment in the world -- a ventilator, which can cost upward of $50,000.\nSamaritan's Purse has used the same field hospital to treat families stricken by Ebola in Liberia, to care for townspeople who had been trapped in rubble after an earthquake in\nEcuador, and to operate on children in Iraq who had been struck by shrapnel launched by the Islamic State.\nA few weeks ago, it set up a similar field hospital in Cremona, Italy, the nation with the world's most coronavirus fatalities. This is the first time one of the hospitals has been\ndeployed in the United States. No one knows how long a field hospital will be needed in the center of Manhattan.\n-- Timothy Williams\nNewton, N.C.\nThe sky was still dark when the Rev. Rob Lee sat down at his desk, picked up his fountain pen and began to write.\nEven in normal times, Mr. Lee, 27, is an early riser. But in the weeks since a pandemic put an end to all routines, including Sunday church, he has been waking up earlier and\nearlier, no need for an alarm.\nHe thinks about his congregation of about 50 regulars and the \"collective pain\" shared across the world right now. He thinks about his wife, who lost hours at her marketing job.\nHe thinks about his mother, a hospice nurse. And, if he is being honest, he thinks about himself, his own mortality. A year and a half ago, a lung collapsed during an asthma\nattack, leaving him especially vulnerable to the outbreak.\nA few weeks ago, as the crisis intensified, he issued an online callout for prayer requests and offered to send handwritten letters in return. So far, he has received more than\n300:\nI am alone in California and far from family.\nI just lost my job today.\nI feel lonely and unsettled in these times.\nMr. Lee, a descendant of General Robert E. Lee who once made headlines for speaking out against white supremacy and Confederate monuments, sees the current crisis as\nanother pivotal moment for the country.\nWriting back to the supplicants has become both a grounding ritual to calm his own anxieties -- and a small act of resistance.\"It's a sense of, we're going to show up,\" he said. \"The coronavirus is terrible, but it's not the fullness of who we are as a people. It's not the end of our story.\"\n-- Sarah Mervos\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of California, Berkeley is a prestigious academic institution known for its research and education in various fields, including biology and genomics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INNOVATIVE GENOMICS INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Innovative Genomics Institute is a research organization at UC Berkeley focused on gene editing and genomics, co-directed by Jennifer Doudna.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMARITAN'S PURSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Samaritan's Purse is a Christian charity that provides medical assistance and disaster relief, including setting up field hospitals in crisis situations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENRIQUE LIN SHIAO<|>PERSON<|>Enrique Lin Shiao is a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley who is involved in presenting data related to clinical tests for the new coronavirus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENNIFER DOUDNA<|>PERSON<|>Jennifer Doudna is a professor at UC Berkeley and co-developer of the CRISPR gene-editing tool, actively involved in COVID-19 testing efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REV.
