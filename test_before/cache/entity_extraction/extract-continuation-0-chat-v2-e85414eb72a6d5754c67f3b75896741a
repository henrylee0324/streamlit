Within the past month, an acid attack against a woman in New York caused her to suffer severe burns, and a man in Texas was charged with attempted murder after attacking an Asian American family.Such stories have become disturbingly frequent since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the FBI has warned that this trend may continue.On March 20, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights expressed concern over violent attacks against people of Asian descent. Asian American and Pacific Islander leaders have condemned such bigotry.And a bipartisan coalition of nearly 200 foreign policy and national security professionals support this letter condemning hate crimes and calling for solidarity (see the full list at USATODAY.com/opinion/).There are many ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has brought out the best of our nation: health care workers laboring around the clock, scientists racing to develop a vaccine. Alarmingly, however, the crisis has also exacerbated prejudice.All Americans must redouble the fight against those forces.U.S. leaders must take action against anti-Asian racism by adhering to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which details ways to reduce and avoid stigma and discrimination. Terms such as \"Chinese virus\" stoke discrimination.America has a history of associating immigrants with diseases. We must learn from that painful history and continue to fight to uphold greater equality of rights and opportunity. America is strongest when it lives up to its guiding principles, including the embrace of diversity and inclusion.History teaches us that injustice and divisions in the United States can be exploited by other governments. These issues can play into the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda in ways that undermine U.S. unity, national interests and global leadership while weakening Washington's critiques of Beijing's human rights abuses.U.S. policies must also address the inequities, including access to health care, that are causing African Americans, Native Americans, Latinx and other communities to disproportionately experience the worst impacts of COVID-19.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a city where a recent acid attack against an Asian woman occurred, highlighting the rise in hate crimes against people of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEXAS<|>GEO<|>Texas is a state where a man was charged with attempted murder after attacking an Asian American family, reflecting the increase in violence against this community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is a federal agency that expressed concern over violent attacks against people of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FBI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The FBI is a federal agency that has warned about the increasing trend of hate crimes against Asian Americans since the COVID-19 pandemic began.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER LEADERS<|>PERSON<|>Asian American and Pacific Islander leaders are individuals who have condemned the rise in hate crimes and bigotry against their communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides guidance to reduce stigma and discrimination related to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese Communist Party is mentioned as an entity that may exploit divisions in the U.S. for propaganda purposes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans and has exacerbated existing prejudices in society.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICA<|>GEO<|>America is the country where these hate crimes are occurring and where leaders are called to take action against anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS<|>FBI<|>Both organizations are concerned about the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans and have issued warnings about this trend<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FBI<|>NEW YORK<|>The FBI's warning about hate crimes is exemplified by the acid attack that occurred in New York<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FBI<|>TEXAS<|>The FBI's warning about hate crimes is exemplified by the attempted murder case in Texas involving an Asian American family<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER LEADERS<|>U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS<|>Asian American and Pacific Islander leaders support the Commission's concerns regarding hate crimes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<|>AMERICA<|>The CDC provides guidance to Americans on how to combat stigma and discrimination during the pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY<|>AMERICA<|>The Chinese Communist Party may exploit divisions in America, which is a concern for U.S. leaders<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>AMERICA<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased hate crimes in America, affecting Asian communities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER LEADERS<|>The pandemic has exacerbated issues of prejudice that Asian American and Pacific Islander leaders are condemning<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
