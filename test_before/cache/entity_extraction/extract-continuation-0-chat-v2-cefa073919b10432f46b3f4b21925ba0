Defendants who are found guilty, but not responsible, are typically confined to a psychiatric institution,\nnot released into the community or sent to prison. And in Wisconsin cases where a jury accepts an insanity\ndefense, a judge can reject that finding.\nKenneth Freeman of Milwaukee was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect this year for killing\nFroedtert Hospital nurse practitioner Carlie Beaudin, 33, as she walked to her car after a 2019 shift at the\nhospital. A judge in Milwaukee County sentenced Freeman in March to spend the rest of his life in a secure\nmental facility.\nWisconsin's best known — and perhaps only — hate-crime case to employ an insanity defense resulted in\nthree life sentences plus 20 years for a Milwaukee County man who gunned down neighbors Phia and Mai Vue\nand Jesus Manso-Perez, and tried to kill a fourth in a racially motivated attack. Jurors rejected Dan Popp's\nclaim that mental illness kept him from acting lawfully.\nInsanity-defense cases usually involve testimony about the defendant's mental health over time. Should\nNavarro employ such a defense, it could pose challenges.\nAs USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reported in July, Navarro's family, a prosecutor, and a judge had raised\nconcerns in the past about Navarro's mental state. But while multiple people raised red flags, there was little\nimmediate evidence that he had undergone an evaluation.\nHis sister in 2019 had described him to Fond du Lac police as a germophobe who wouldn't pick something up\nwithout paper towels or toilet paper in his hands. Another relative told authorities a doctor had recommendedhe have a mental health evaluation. And the Fond du Lac County circuit judge overseeing his 2019 disorderly-\nconduct case had ordered a psychological evaluation.But when one a test was not conducted in the time called for under law, the judge released Navarro from jail\nand withdrew the order.\nContact Doug Schneider at (920) 431-8333, or DSchneid@gannett.com. Follow him on Twitter at\n@PGDougSchneider\nRecent Wisconsin hate crimes\nWisconsin has seen some hate-driven crimes of violence recently. Some exhibit an element of pre-planning.\nMilwaukee resident Clifton Blackwell, 62, is set for trial in November on a felony charge of first-degree\nreckless injury as a hate crime. Prosecutors say he threw acid in the face of 42-year-old U.S. citizen Mahud\nVillalaz outside a Milwaukee restaurant last fall after making anti-immigrant remarks and accusing Villalaz of\n\"invading\" the U.S.\nVillalaz suffered facial burns. He has recovered.\nIn late June, 18-year-old Althea Bernstein told Madison police she was approached at a light by four white\nmen; she said one sprayed her with a flammable liquid. Bernstein, who is biracial, said a man threw a lit\nmatch or lighter at her, briefly setting her face and neck on fire, the Associated Press reported.\nCity police and the FBI are investigating that as a possible hate crime. At least $15,000 in reward money\nhas been posted for information leading to the capture of a suspect.\nSmall city hate crimes\nHate crimes aren't just a big city problem in Wisconsin.\nIn June, Marathon County prosecutors charged Aaron Nielson, 51, of Wausau, with misdemeanor battery\nand disorderly conduct, after an attack on a biracial man outside a Wausau convenience store. Joseph\nMurphy, who is Menominee Indian and Black, said Nielson scuffled with him after approaching and uttering\nracial slurs. Witnesses confirmed Murphy's account.\nIn May, a Stevens Point man was accused of a hate crime in connection with the verbal harassment of\nAsian-Americans at a Point grocery store. Police told Wisconsin Public Radio that harassment of the local\nHmong population has increased since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year.\nAlso, someone in February 2019 posted a racist, anti-Islamic slur on a building housing a La Crosse taxicab\ncompany run by Mike Ahmad, a Muslim. The graffiti included a common anti-Black slur.\nSome charges don't stick\nNot all Wisconsin cases charged as hate crimes result in hate-crime convictions.\nA former De Pere man who initially was accused of a hate crime after yelling a racial slur and shooting at a\nman in downtown Green Bay in 2017 was convicted of two felonies and a misdemeanor. The hate crime\nenhancer was withdrawn after authorities agreed that the slur was more likely the result of the defendant's\nintoxication.\nDaniel Navarro, 27, appears by webcam during his initial court appearance on Thursday, July 9, in Fond du\nLac County Circuit Court.\nDoug Raflik/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\nCREDIT: Doug Schneider\nCopyright 2020 - THE REPORTER - All Rights Reserved.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KENNETH FREEMAN<|>PERSON<|>Kenneth Freeman is a defendant from Milwaukee who was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect for killing nurse practitioner Carlie Beaudin.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARLIE BEAUDIN<|>PERSON<|>Carlie Beaudin was a nurse practitioner at Froedtert Hospital who was killed by Kenneth Freeman.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FROEDTERT HOSPITAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Froedtert Hospital is a healthcare facility in Milwaukee where Carlie Beaudin worked.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAN POPP<|>PERSON<|>Dan Popp is a Milwaukee County man who received three life sentences plus 20 years for a racially motivated attack.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHIA VUE<|>PERSON<|>Phia Vue was one of the neighbors gunned down in a racially motivated attack by Dan Popp.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAI VUE<|>PERSON<|>Mai Vue was one of the neighbors gunned down in a racially motivated attack by Dan Popp.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JESUS MANSO-PEREZ<|>PERSON<|>Jesus Manso-Perez was one of the neighbors gunned down in a racially motivated attack by Dan Popp.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAVARRO<|>PERSON<|>Navarro is a defendant whose mental state has raised concerns among family, prosecutors, and a judge.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOUG SCHNEIDER<|>PERSON<|>Doug Schneider is a journalist who reported on the cases mentioned in the text.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WISCONSIN<|>GEO<|>Wisconsin is the U.S. state where the legal cases and incidents of hate crimes are occurring.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILWAUKEE<|>GEO<|>Milwaukee is a city in Wisconsin where several incidents of hate crimes and legal cases are reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAUSAU<|>GEO<|>Wausau is a city in Wisconsin where a hate crime incident occurred involving Aaron Nielson.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEVENS POINT<|>GEO<|>Stevens Point is a city in Wisconsin where a hate crime incident involving verbal harassment occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LA CROSSE<|>GEO<|>La Crosse is a city in Wisconsin where racist graffiti was posted on a building housing a taxicab company run by Mike Ahmad.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIKE AHMAD<|>PERSON<|>Mike Ahmad is a Muslim who runs a taxicab company in La Crosse, Wisconsin, which was targeted by racist graffiti.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KENNETH FREEMAN<|>CARLIE BEAUDIN<|>Kenneth Freeman was found not guilty for the murder of Carlie Beaudin, a nurse practitioner at Froedtert Hospital.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FROEDTERT HOSPITAL<|>CARLIE BEAUDIN<|>Carlie Beaudin worked at Froedtert Hospital, where she was employed as a nurse practitioner.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAN POPP<|>PHIA VUE<|>Dan Popp was involved in a racially motivated attack that resulted in the death of Phia Vue.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAN POPP<|>MAI VUE<|>Dan Popp was involved in a racially motivated attack that resulted in the death of Mai Vue.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAN POPP<|>JESUS MANSO-PEREZ<|>Dan Popp was involved in a racially motivated attack that resulted in the death of Jesus Manso-Perez.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAVARRO<|>WISCONSIN<|>Navarro is a defendant in a case that has raised concerns about his mental state in Wisconsin.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAVARRO<|>DOUG SCHNEIDER<|>Doug Schneider reported on Navarro's case and the concerns raised about his mental state.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAVARRO<|>MILWAUKEE<|>Navarro's case is part of the legal proceedings occurring in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AARON NIELSON<|>WAUSAU<|>Aaron Nielson was charged with a hate crime in Wausau, Wisconsin.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVENS POINT<|>WISCONSIN<|>Stevens Point is a city in Wisconsin where hate crime incidents have been reported.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIKE AHMAD<|>LA CROSSE<|>Mike Ahmad's taxicab company in La Crosse was targeted by racist graffiti.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
