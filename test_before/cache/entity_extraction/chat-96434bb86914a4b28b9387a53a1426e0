Some of them had faced\ndiscrimination as well.\n\"We started to talk about what we, as social scientists, can do something for our community?\" one of the\nresearchers, Zhenqiang Zhao, told The Arizona Republic.\nHaving known each other for a long time, the five students decided to do a research project on the issue.\nThe purpose of the project was to learn about the experiences of Asian students, specifically East and Southeast\nAsian students, at UA during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the project's consent form.\nSome harassment stems from the origins of the 2019 new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, first identified\nthat year in Wuhan, China.\nThis study sought to understand how Asian students perceived and experienced anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19, the potential impacts of anti-Asian discrimination on ethnic identity, and how anti-Asian\ndiscrimination related to activism, the form said.\nStudent: 'He said scum bucket China boy here to take our\nchecks and then spat on me'\nAfter collecting data in October and November 2020, the team presented its preliminary analysis in an online\nmeeting hosted by the Frances McClelland Institute for Children, Youth, and Families on March 4.\nThe FMI serves as a catalyst for cross-disciplinary research on children, youth and families at the University of\nArizona, according to the institute's Facebook page.\nIn its preliminary analysis, the team identified three types of anti-Asian discrimination that Asian students\nexperienced due to the pandemic: vicarious (indirect) discrimination, overt (direct) discrimination and\nambiguous discrimination, Zhao said.\nIn the presentation, the team provided quotes from the student participants about their experiences.\nOne participant said he had a couple of experiences when going to the lab, according to the presentation.\n\"So I have to take the public transportation and when I go pass along the bus stops. Some, some guy. I did not\nlook at him. He said scum bucket China boy here to take our checks and then spat on me and I'm like okay and\nI just kept walking,\" the participant said, according to the presentation.\nThe student participants were not identified by the research team or by The Republic because they have been\ntargets of harassment.\n\"They use some profanity and they're like all the Chinese are here to kill us,\" another participant said.\nThe team also found physical aversions against Asian people.\nA freshman at the University of Arizona experienced physical aversions when the person was in high school,\nlived in Chandler, and worked in the drive-thru at a fast-food chain restaurant, according to the presentation.\n\"I had a customer not want to be served by me,\" the freshman said, according to the presentation. \"They want\nto be served by someone else when they came to the window.\"\nThe worker told their manager who took care of the situation by telling the customer they couldn't serve them\nanymore, according to the presentation.\nThe team defined indirect discrimination as hearing about or seeing another person's experiences of racism via\nthe news media or social media, or an experience reported by family members or friends that may or may not\nbe witnessed by the participants, Zhao explained in the presentation.\n\"I have a friend who worked at a cafe and she also had a similar experience where a customer came up to her\nand asked her if she was from China and my friend said yes. And he started saying, you know, you know, go\nback to China and things like that. Basically blaming her for the pandemic,\" another participant said.\nAnother participant said they were asked \"where are you from\" more often than before the pandemic. \"But I feel\na little uncomfortable because it seems they, the person, asked me vaguely if you brought a virus from China,\"\nthe participant said.\nThe team learned that Asian and Asian American students are aware of the hostile and discriminatory social contexts that have made them more cautious in their daily lives, Sei Eun Kim explained in the presentation.\nGiven that the study took place in Phoenix and Tucson, the research team highlighted the need for research\nfrom Asian and Asian Americans in rural areas during these times, Kim said.\nSupport sought for Asian students during the in-person fall semester\nThe University of Arizona announced on March 9 its plans to return to majority in-person learning for the fall\nsemester.\nHopefully, the team members have their perspectives, voices and thoughts organized and unified at the UA,\n\"so that in the transition to the fall semester, Asian Americans and Asian students will feel that they have\nresources and support, and that there are followers who are doing this research that can actually boost their\nconfidence and their sense of unity and comfort,\" Kim said.\nZhao said he hopes the college and its departments can be ready for these kinds of issues for Asian people in\nthe fall semester.\n\"Our ultimate goal or final goal is that we really want Asian Americans' and other Asian students' voices to be\nheard by society or by the campus, by the college,\" Zhao said. \"And we can get the support from the\ndepartment, from the school, and from each other.\"\nUA Asian students (both international and domestic students) who have lived in the U.S. during the pandemic\nand are willing to participate in the research can visit http://tiny.cc/asianvoice to complete the survey.
