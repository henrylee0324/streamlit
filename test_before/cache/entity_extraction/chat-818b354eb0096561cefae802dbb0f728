Racialized migrants are frequently\ndenied landed immigrant status, family reunification, provincial health coverage, unemployment benefits,\nworkplace protections and other social entitlements and worker protections.\nA replacement citizenship guide is long overdue. A new guide should further highlight working-class struggles\npushing Canada's efforts in realizing rights to health, education and social security, including the role of old\nage security pensions in reducing poverty among seniors.\nEven so, these measures have been markedly scaled back in recent years, with resultant increases in poverty.\nThey have never fully addressed racial, class and gender inequities.\nA new citizenship guide must also acknowledge ongoing patterns of institutional oppression if we are to begin\nto address them. Building on resources such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Canadian\nHuman Rights Tribunal's rulings, a revised citizenship guide should reaffirm the importance of respecting\neveryone's human rights as outlined in the charter.\nWe urge the federal government to issue a new citizenship guide that accurately reflects the past and\nrecognizes current challenges of redressing systemic racism and pervasive social and economic inequalities.\nThis is a pivotal first step in ensuring dignified futures for new Canadians, and building a society that fosters\nequity, human rights, and social, economic and cultural respect.
