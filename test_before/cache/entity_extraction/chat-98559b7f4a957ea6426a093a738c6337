Add those working in nursing homes and others collecting garbage and recycling.\nThe worst is the attack on Asian Canadians, both verbal and physical.\nA much larger white guy punches a small Asian in the face. Another yells at two Asian women aboard a Vancouver bus. \"Go back to your country; that's where it all started.\"\nAnd Canadian singer Bryan Adams goes into a Twitter rant condemning \"bat-eating, wet-market animal selling, virus-making greedy bastards\" who are responsible for turning the world on end by introducing the world to the pandemic.\nAdams was accused of racism and apologized. I don't know why.\nMany news agencies, including CBS, USA Today and closer to home, CTV News, posit the virus may have indeed been carried by a bat, spread to an intermediary animal that in turn was sold at an unsanitary so-called \"wet market\" in Hunan province in China. If you have looked up these markets online you can easily see the filthy conditions that could spawn this pandemic.\nThere is no chance the virus was created in a Chinese lab, say American, British and Australian researchers. Adams is quite likely speaking the truth and if you don't like it, too bad.\nBut abusive language and physical violence against Chinese Canadians - in some cases lumping all Asians together - is flat out wrong.\nThe overall Canadian favourability toward China has plummeted to 14 per cent, according to an Angus Reid Institute poll. And 85 per cent say the Chinese government has not been honest or transparent about the pandemic.\n  In other words, it is not the Chinese, it is the Chinese government our anger should be directed toward.\nThe Chinese government also said the virus could not have come from a wet market because the government made wet markets illegal. Sure, more than one billion people and the communist government said it is so, then it must be so. It is the same tactic used by Trump - if you don't test for the coronavirus the number would be very few. \"It's common sense,\" says the nonsensical buffoon.\nDamned fools. (Clarification: In a column last week headlined, 'Father, son playing catch expensive these days', the first subject tackled was the King Street, Trenton, reconstruction.\nI was given erroneous information by someone who was not qualified to give me the goods on the revamping. Suffice it to say residents will have a spot for garbage and recycling and will not have to put said items on the bike lane.)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
