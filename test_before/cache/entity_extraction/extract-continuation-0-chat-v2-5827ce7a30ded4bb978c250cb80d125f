Red lanterns swinging above the pagodas are\nreminiscent of tumbleweed. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, tourism has declined drastically, leaving beloved businesses\nquestioning their future.\nSan Francisco's Chinatown, a historic neighborhood that has been a beacon for immigrants and the \"American dream,\" has faced racial\ndiscrimination, repressive legislation, a massive earthquake, and now a pandemic - one of the greatest tests of this resilient\nneighborhood's more than century-long existence.\nIt is in this situation where Orlando Kuan finds himself, on a metal folding chair next to a crowded table of pastries outside his\nstorefront on a Sunday afternoon, frequently known to be the busiest day for business. Grant Avenue, a once-bustling street in San\nFrancisco's Chinatown, is devoid of tourists. Only the most loyal locals are left to patronize their favorite family-owned businesses.\nEastern Bakery, a cornerstone of the neighborhood, first opened its doors in 1924, and it became the oldest bakery in Chinatown. But\nbusiness has slowed to a crawl. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, typically one of the busiest times of year, the bakery logged a 70%\ndrop in sales, according to Kuan.\nStill, he continues to personally greet customers - who once included President Bill Clinton - marveling at his table of famous lotus\nmooncakes and coffee crunch cake, a traditional recipe that is a big seller.\nIn March, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a stay-home order, which restricted nonessential travel, affecting 40 million\nCalifornians. In July, he called for statewide closures for dine-in restaurants, bars, movie theaters, and family entertainment centers\nsuch as bowling alleys, mini-golf facilities, and arcades.\nNow, Portsmouth Square, Chinatown's living room, is devoid of the usual pack of Chinatown residents who come to the park to mingle,\npractice Tai Chi, and play checkers.\nAccording to the San Francisco Travel Association, tourism to the city has been slashed in half, and tourist spending has plunged by\nnearly 70% this year.\n\"As early as January 2020, we were already starting to see an impact. This was during a period when Chinatown generates a bulk of\nrevenue. There was a one-third drop in attendance for the Lunar New Year parade, which was economically devastating,\" said Malcolm\nYeung, executive director of the Chinatown Community Development Center. \"This was definitely behind the racist rhetoric around the\ncoronavirus.\"\nYeung is referring to the impact on the Asian American community after President Donald Trump's use of xenophobic language in an\neffort to place blame on China for the spread of the virus. \"Thank you all for being here, and we continue our relentless effort to defeat\nthe Chinese virus,\" the president said to a pool of reporters in March.\nBusinesses such as Eastern Bakery are not the only ones struggling to stay afloat. Man Hing, a Chinese Arts and Crafts store, also\nbased on Grant Avenue, is going out of business. Owner Eddie Au said that the pandemic is not the only reason for closing after 54\nyears at the shop. \"The economy isn't good, and Chinatown will take three to four years to recover,\" Au said.\nEighty percent of his customers are tourists originating from Europe or Mexico, he said. With the economy collapsing, Au saw his\nopportunity to close up shop and retire.\nChinatown Alleyway Tours, a program from the Chinatown Community Development Center, has gotten innovative. The youth-led and\n-designed program consisted of a historical tour of the Chinatown neighborhood and alleyways, and it featured groups as large as 15\nto 20 people.\nLisa Yu, senior community organizer at Chinatown Community Development Center, said, \"Our in-person tours stopped in March, but\nwe plan to do Minecraft virtual tours next year.\"\nThe virtual tours, built and designed by the high school youth leaders, are still in production and are being tested internally.\nTo empower the community and keep spirit alive, the neighborhood is trying to adapt to a changed world. The Chinese Culture Center\npartnered with 100 Days of Action, Project Artivism and the Chinatown Visitor Information Center in an initiative called Art for\nEssential Workers to liven up the area, with murals painted by Asian American artists on boarded-up storefronts.\n\"Chinatown is such a rich community, living, breathing, and depending on tourists. It's an economic engine tied to tourism - for people\nafar,\" said Jenny Leung, the executive director of the Chinese Culture Center.\nThe challenges have not let up. This month, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, a Democrat, rolled back the reopening of indoor\ndining because of a spike in coronavirus cases. The changes have affected a variety of businesses and kept the future of tourism in the\ncity foggy.\nAmong those hit hardest are banquet restaurants in Chinatown, which rely on the indoor dining experience.\nR&G Lounge on Kearny Street celebrates Cantonese cuisine in a formal setting. Designed to bring families together, the dining rooms\nare generally crammed with round marble tables to encourage family-style meals. At this restaurant on a recent evening, guests were\nserved a 9-inch cod dish and a simmering pot of winter melon soup next to the salt and pepper Dungeness crab, suitable for a party of\neight.\nThese banquet restaurants offer an intimate experience over a comforting meal, and frequent visitors say that without them,\nChinatown would not be the same.\nBy one untraditional metric of business, which might be dubbed the fortune cookie index, the slump has been severe. On an average\nday, Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory would produce\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a major city in California, known for its historic Chinatown and diverse culture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown in San Francisco is the oldest Chinatown in the United States, historically significant for immigrants and cultural heritage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORLANDO KUAN<|>PERSON<|>Orlando Kuan is a business owner in Chinatown, known for running a pastry shop and engaging with customers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EASTERN BAKERY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eastern Bakery is the oldest bakery in Chinatown, established in 1924, known for its traditional pastries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALCOLM YEUNG<|>PERSON<|>Malcolm Yeung is the executive director of the Chinatown Community Development Center, advocating for the community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDWARD AU<|>PERSON<|>Eddie Au is the owner of Man Hing, a Chinese Arts and Crafts store in Chinatown, which is closing due to economic challenges.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinatown Community Development Center is an organization focused on community empowerment and development in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE CULTURE CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese Culture Center is an organization that promotes Chinese culture and community initiatives in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONDON BREED<|>PERSON<|>London Breed is the Mayor of San Francisco, involved in decisions affecting the city's businesses and public health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R&G LOUNGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>R&G Lounge is a banquet restaurant in Chinatown known for its Cantonese cuisine and family-style dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORTSMOUTH SQUARE<|>GEO<|>Portsmouth Square is a public park in Chinatown, often referred to as the neighborhood's living room.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN GATE FORTUNE COOKIE FACTORY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory is a business in Chinatown known for producing fortune cookies.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLANDO KUAN<|>EASTERN BAKERY<|>Orlando Kuan is a business owner in Chinatown, and Eastern Bakery is a significant establishment in the same neighborhood<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MALCOLM YEUNG<|>CHINATOWN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CENTER<|>Malcolm Yeung is the executive director of the Chinatown Community Development Center, which he represents<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDWARD AU<|>CHINATOWN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CENTER<|>Eddie Au's business struggles are part of the broader economic challenges addressed by the Chinatown Community Development Center<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LONDON BREED<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>London Breed, as the Mayor, makes decisions that impact the city of San Francisco, including Chinatown<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R&G LOUNGE<|>CHINATOWN<|>R&G Lounge is a prominent restaurant located in Chinatown, contributing to its culinary landscape<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE CULTURE CENTER<|>CHINATOWN<|>The Chinese Culture Center is involved in initiatives that enhance the cultural vibrancy of Chinatown<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MALCOLM YEUNG<|>ORLANDO KUAN<|>Malcolm Yeung and Orlando Kuan are both involved in the Chinatown community, addressing its challenges<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EASTERN BAKERY<|>CHINATOWN<|>Eastern Bakery is a historic business that is a key part of Chinatown's identity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOLDEN GATE FORTUNE COOKIE FACTORY<|>CHINATOWN<|>Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory is a business that contributes to the cultural and economic fabric of Chinatown<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PORTSMOUTH SQUARE<|>CHINATOWN<|>Portsmouth Square serves as a central gathering place for the community in Chinatown<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
