Despite booking several tickets home to Chengdu, the flights kept getting cancelled with China and other countries imposing restrictions on air travel as the Covid-19 pandemic escalated.\n\"I have two tickets for May, but I'm not confident that those flights will run. There's no reason for me to be here, and it's a stressful experience staying here all alone,\" he said. Yue is among the roughly 350,000 Chinese students studying at US colleges and universities, the largest group of foreign students in the country.\nIt is not clear how many have remained in the United States since their campuses shut and other classmates headed home to finish their semesters online.\nBut students say the pandemic has done more than disrupt travel plans and studies.\nIt has also brought them face to face with an increase in anti-China sentiment and a surge in racism against Asians and Asian-Americans, and some are questioning what that means for their futures in the US.\nAmong them is a graduate student in Tennessee who said he was picking up groceries when he overheard two men call him a \"Chinese virus\", a term that has been used by Donald Trump.\n\"It was just after the 'Chinese virus' was first used on social media, and I was called [that] by two men when I was getting out of my car and wearing a mask,\" he said. The student said the mask made him feel safe from infection, but that he worried his ethnicity put him in danger.\n\"It changes my feelings about the US and my interest in being in the US. I hope I can be respected and not be attacked when I am living here. To be honest, living in the US is making me feel unsafe right now,\" he said, giving this as the reason he did not want to be named.\nThe rise in racism against Asians has been well documented, and ABC News recently reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had warned of a potential surge in hate crimes against Asian-Americans in a report sent to law enforcement agencies around the country.\nAn analysis published on April 8 by the US NGO the Network Contagion Research Institute, which tracks online hate speech, found \"acute increases\" in targeted ethnic hate as well as Sinophobia on niche online forums, with indications this was spilling over onto popular social media sites.\nA reporting platform for coronavirus-related discrimination set up late last month by the California-based groups Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action received over a thousand reports of such incidents in two weeks.\nThe initiative is a collaboration with San Francisco State University's Asian American Studies Department.\nAnxious to avoid confrontations, some Chinese students said they had changed their daily habits.\nEva Chen, a recent graduate working in New York, decided not to wear a mask on the subway to avoid attracting attention.\nShe felt the rise in racism was linked to American criticisms of Beijing for its management of the outbreak, which made some \"start to blame Chinese people\". New York University student Lyujiang Chen stopped taking the subway altogether after hearing stories of friends being harassed for wearing face masks on trains. He said he loved New York and hoped to work there after he graduated, but was worried about how welcome he would be.\n\"The thing I'm concerned about is the citizens, what's their opinion about China now? Will they think because the first outbreak was in China that China is responsible for the disaster? I'm not sure about this, so that's something I worry about,\" he said.\nCalvin Lei, an anthropology and cognitive science student at Vassar College in New York, said he had felt \"a lot of love\" on a personal level, but witnessing racism in the public sphere and inequalities in the health care system had taught him more about the country.\n\"It makes me have second thoughts about what it means for me to stay in this country,\" he said. \"America traditionally prides itself on being the country of freedom and diversity, but [all] this does not reflect that spirit.\"\nAs students eye a return to China, they also face concerns back home as authorities there try to contain the rise in imported cases of Covid-19.\nThese measures have prompted complaints of racism and discrimination against foreigners - most notably in Guangzhou, where Africans are reported to have been evicted from their homes or hotels or subjected to forced quarantine - but Chinese nationals returning from overseas have also faced prejudice.\nStudents coming home have faced calls that they should be banned from re-entering the country because of concerns they could bring back infections.\nLyujiang Chen, who was able to return to China before flight restrictions were implemented, followed these comments online before and during his 14-day mandatory quarantine and said it made him feel worse.\n\"It's like we're from some virus area going back to China,\" he said, although he believes this was a fringe opinion that had been amplified by social media.\nYue, who remains on campus in California, has been watching that situation closely, too.\nSince the outbreak, he has seen people, some of whom he knows, obviously go out of their way to avoid him.\nHe also said he was not surprised by the uptick in racism and discrimination, because he knew that these were deep-seated issues in the United States and \"it's just that this virus has brought the Asians to the front of the stage this time\".\nBut what has surprised him was the opposition to Chinese students coming home.\n\"There's always this idea that's implanted in me that whatever happens, I'm still a Chinese citizen,\" he said.\n\"But this attitude online has been pretty saddening. It's like you wanted your family members to appreciate you coming back, but they actually shut the door on you.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>YUE QU<|>PERSON<|>Yue Qu is a Chinese student studying in California who is experiencing isolation due to travel restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHENGDU<|>GEO<|>Chengdu is a city in China where Yue Qu is originally from.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is the state in the United States where Yue Qu is attending university.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The Covid-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to travel restrictions and increased racism against Asians in the US.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TENNESSEE<|>GEO<|>Tennessee is a state in the United States where another Chinese student experienced racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a state in the United States where Eva Chen and Lyujiang Chen are located.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VASSAR COLLEGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vassar College is an educational institution in New York where Calvin Lei studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>San Francisco State University is an educational institution collaborating on a reporting platform for discrimination against Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC PLANNING AND POLICY COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>This organization is involved in setting up a reporting platform for coronavirus-related discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>This organization collaborates with the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council to address discrimination against Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETWORK CONTAGION RESEARCH INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>This NGO tracks online hate speech and reported increases in ethnic hate during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUE QU<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Yue Qu is studying in California during the Covid-19 pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUE QU<|>CHENGDU<|>Yue Qu is originally from Chengdu, China<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>YUE QU<|>The Covid-19 pandemic has caused Yue Qu to remain isolated in California<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TENNESSEE<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The Covid-19 pandemic has led to increased racism experienced by a Chinese student in Tennessee<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The Covid-19 pandemic has affected Chinese students like Eva Chen and Lyujiang Chen in New York<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>California is experiencing the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, impacting students like Yue Qu<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VASSAR COLLEGE<|>CALVIN LEI<|>Calvin Lei is a student at Vassar College<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ASIAN PACIFIC PLANNING AND POLICY COUNCIL<|>These organizations are collaborating on a reporting platform for discrimination<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC PLANNING AND POLICY COUNCIL<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>These organizations are working together to address discrimination against Asians<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETWORK CONTAGION RESEARCH INSTITUTE<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The Network Contagion Research Institute reported increases in ethnic hate during the Covid-19 pandemic<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
