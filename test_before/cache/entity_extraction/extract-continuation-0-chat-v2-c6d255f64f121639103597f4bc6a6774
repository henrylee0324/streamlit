The ad tries to attack Biden by splicing clips to falsely suggest that the former governor of Washington, who is Asian American and a colleague of Biden's, was really an official of the Chinese government.\nAll of this has unfolded against a backdrop of hundreds of reports from around the country of rising harassment and hate crimes: increased attacks against members of the Asian/Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) community.\nSuch acts have even included physical assaults in New York and Texas, where an Asian American family, including two young children, were stabbed by a man who said he acted because he thought the family was spreading the coronavirus.\nOhio is not immune. In our state, we are proudly home to 350,000 AAPI residents. According to an open letter condemning coronavirus-fueled racism that was organized by the Ohio Progressive Asian Women's Leadership and signed by over 100 Ohio organizations, children across Ohio have recently experienced increased bullying based on their AAPI heritage.\nTragically, we know from examples like that involving Emilie Olsen – a 13-year-old Chinese American girl from Fairfield who committed suicide in 2014 after being bullied in part based on her heritage – that such harassment can have deadly consequences.\nHamilton County is also not immune. According to the FBI, of all major cities in Ohio, Cincinnati recently had the highest per capita rate of reported hate crimes, with 30 incidents in 2018 alone. Given that hate crimes are notoriously underreported, it is almost certain that more are occurring.\nI know from my experience prosecuting hate crimes when I was a federal prosecutor, that Hamilton County has seen its fair share of them. Sadly, we have also looked the other way, such as when a Cincinnati jury acquitted an attacker for the tragic beating and murder of Vincent Chin in an infamous anti-AAPI hate crime from the 1980s.\nWith the recent rise in hate crimes and harassment, it is painfully clear that we must do more to strengthen our hate crime protections. Specifically:\nWe must call on Ohio lawmakers to change our ethnic intimidation law, so committing a hate crime is an automatic felony offense.\nWe should also expand Ohio's hate crime law to cover sexual orientation, gender identity, and those with disabilities.\nWe should tap special prosecutors trained in hate crimes to handle these cases through a Civil Rights Division at the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office, which I have previously called for creating.\nFinally, we should elect a prosecutor who will not be silent in the face of these kinds of attacks, or Trump's inciteful behavior – not during this crisis, and not ever.\nWe need a prosecutor who will call out the dangerous rhetoric, because words matter and can lead to violence.\nWe need a prosecutor who will build bridges with members of our AAPI, African American, and Latinx communities, and all communities that are vulnerable to bias crimes.\nWe need a prosecutor who will learn from other elected prosecutors and set up innovative mechanisms such as hate crime hotlines.\nFinally, we need a prosecutor who will actively encourage victims of potential hate crimes to tell law enforcement, because the law cannot address what it does not know.\nWe do not currently have such a leader in the prosecutor's office, which is why I'm running, and asking for your support. We must meet hate and fear with action, and we must do it together. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\"\nWe are all in this together.\nGabe Davis is seeking the Democratic nomination for Hamilton County prosecutor in the Ohio Primary Election.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States who has been accused of stoking bigotry and ethnic intimidation during the COVID-19 crisis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the former Vice President of the United States and a political opponent of Donald Trump.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMILIE OLSEN<|>PERSON<|>Emilie Olsen was a 13-year-old Chinese American girl who tragically committed suicide in 2014 after being bullied based on her heritage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAMILTON COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Hamilton County is a county in Ohio that has experienced a rise in hate crimes and harassment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINCINNATI<|>GEO<|>Cincinnati is a major city in Ohio known for having the highest per capita rate of reported hate crimes in 2018.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OHIO<|>GEO<|>Ohio is a state in the United States with a significant population of AAPI residents and ongoing issues with hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OHIO PROGRESSIVE ASIAN WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ohio Progressive Asian Women's Leadership is an organization that condemned coronavirus-fueled racism and organized an open letter against it.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAMILTON COUNTY PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office is the legal office responsible for prosecuting crimes in Hamilton County, Ohio.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OHIO PRIMARY ELECTION<|>EVENT<|>The Ohio Primary Election is an electoral event where candidates are nominated for various political offices in Ohio.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>JOE BIDEN<|>Donald Trump ran a negative ad against Joe Biden, attempting to attack his character by misrepresenting his connections<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMILIE OLSEN<|>HAMILTON COUNTY<|>Emilie Olsen's tragic story highlights the impact of bullying and hate crimes in Hamilton County<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAMILTON COUNTY<|>CINCINNATI<|>Cincinnati is a city within Hamilton County that has reported a high rate of hate crimes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAMILTON COUNTY<|>OHIO<|>Hamilton County is located in Ohio and is part of the state's ongoing issues with hate crimes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OHIO PROGRESSIVE ASIAN WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP<|>OHIO<|>The organization is based in Ohio and addresses issues of racism affecting the AAPI community in the state<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAMILTON COUNTY PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE<|>HAMILTON COUNTY<|>The Prosecutor's Office is responsible for handling legal matters in Hamilton County, including hate crimes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GABE DAVIS<|>HAMILTON COUNTY PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE<|>Gabe Davis is running for the position of Hamilton County prosecutor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GABE DAVIS<|>OHIO PRIMARY ELECTION<|>Gabe Davis is seeking the Democratic nomination in the Ohio Primary Election<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
