Governments should protect and support civil society organizations doing this work, as well as those reporting on the impacts of the outbreak.\nDuring the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, nongovernmental groups, local newspapers, and community radio played a key role in public health education.\nIn Hong Kong, ordinary people have organized themselves to create and distribute masks and hand sanitizers to the most vulnerable to fill policy gaps. But the Chinese government has long maintained a stranglehold on nongovernmental organizations and some groups are struggling with reduced funding during the outbreak.\nIn Italy, authorities have subjected nongovernment sea rescue organizations assisting migrants and asylum seekers to quarantines at dock despite crew members and passengers testing negative for the virus. In a context in which civilian rescue missions have been consistently undermined, blocked, and even criminalized, potentially unnecessary quarantines might be used to deter rescue at sea.\nGovernments should not exploit the coronavirus pandemic to criminalize or obstruct the work of civil society organizations.\nPromote the rights to water and sanitation\nThe rights to water and to sanitation are part of the right to an adequate standard of living. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has reaffirmed that the rights to water and sanitation are an essential component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and integrally related, among other Covenant rights, to the right to health.\nBillions of people around the world do not have access to safe drinking water. Yet, as the WHO has noted the provision of safe water, sanitation, and hygienic conditions is essential to protecting human health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Prevention of human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 virus may be supported by promotion of the rights to water and sanitation, and supporting water and wastewater infrastructure and technicians to ensure good and consistently applied water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and waste management practices in communities, homes, schools, marketplaces, and healthcare facilities. More research is needed to understand the risk of contaminated drinking water, environmental transmission, and how to ensure wastewater operators are trained and supported throughout the crisis.\nLack of potable water and sanitation at home, school, or in healthcare settings will make preventative measures difficult. In some cases, without adequate water and sanitation these settings themselves may be a locus for the spread of the disease.\nVenezuela's healthcare infrastructure is so weak that the most basic recommendation -handwashing - is difficult even for healthcare providers, who work under difficult conditions. The Venezuelan doctors and nurses Human Rights Watch interviewed over the past few months said that soap and disinfectants were virtually nonexistent in their clinics and hospitals. As inflation has risen and salaries have been devalued, it has become impossible for them to bring in their own supplies. Public hospitals in Caracas, the capital, are also suffering regular water shortages. In remote hospitals, the shortages have lasted weeks to months. Patients and personnel have been required to bring their own water for drinking and sometimes for flushing toilets.\nGovernments should immediately suspend any water shutoffs for failure to pay. Discontinuing water services for failure to pay in any context is incompatible with human rights and can be particularly harmful in the context of public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEnsure humanitarian aid continues\nAccording to the United Nations, a number of the many countries affected by COVID-19 are already facing crises due to conflicts, natural disasters, or climate change. Many people in those crisis-hit countries rely on humanitarian aid to survive.\nGovernments should ensure that support for vital humanitarian operations carried out by the UN and other aid agencies does not suffer as a result of COVID-19.\nTarget economic relief to assist low-wage workers\nGovernments should take policy measures to buffer the economic impacts of COVID-19, which will affect lower-wage workers first and hardest. Social distancing, quarantine, and the closure of businesses may have enormous economic consequences. The most vulnerable people are low-wage workers in low-income households. Governments should create mechanisms so that workers affected by COVID-19 do not suffer loss of income that might deter them from self-isolating to contain the spread of the virus.\nPublic health experts recommend that companies encourage employees to work from home to prevent the virus from spreading. But remote work is not an option for millions of workers in fields like retail, restaurants, personal services, the gig economy, and informal sectors. In these fields, employment situations are more precarious, wages tend to be lower, and in some countries workers have low rates of paid sick leave. Particularly in countries such as the US, where low pay may combine with lack of access to sick leave and healthcare coverage, these workers will need assistance.\nHuman Rights Watch has long urged governments to guarantee paid sick and family leave to enable workers to take time off to care for new children or ill or older family members or to deal with their own serious health conditions without losing pay. In the context of COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks, paid sick and family leave helps ensure workers who are sick - or those with sick family members - can stay home to minimize the spread of the virus.\nMany governments guarantee some paid sick leave to all workers. Others - most notably the US among developed economies - do not. Low-wage earners, service workers, informal workers, and workers in the gig economy are among those least likely to have paid sick leave. The lack of paid sick and family leave means disease outbreaks like COVID-19 place an undue burden on poor and marginalized workers and exacerbate economic inequality and also contribute to gender inequity. To support families during the outbreak, sick and family leave should cover self-isolation and caregiving responsibilities during school and care facility closures.\nGlobal\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Civil society organizations are groups that work to support efforts in public health, particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring access to care and social services for affected individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EBOLA OUTBREAK<|>EVENT<|>The Ebola outbreak in 2014 in West Africa was a significant public health crisis that highlighted the role of various organizations in health education and response efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONG KONG<|>GEO<|>Hong Kong is a region where ordinary citizens organized to provide masks and hand sanitizers to vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE GOVERNMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese government has been known to restrict the activities of nongovernmental organizations, particularly during health crises.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALY<|>GEO<|>Italy is a country where authorities have imposed quarantines on sea rescue organizations assisting migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VENEZUELA<|>GEO<|>Venezuela is a country facing severe healthcare infrastructure challenges, particularly in providing basic sanitation and water access during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARACAS<|>GEO<|>Caracas is the capital of Venezuela, where public hospitals are experiencing regular water shortages affecting healthcare delivery.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations is an international organization that provides humanitarian aid and support to countries affected by crises, including those impacted by COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Human Rights Watch is an organization that advocates for the rights of individuals and has called for governments to ensure paid sick leave and support for low-wage workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOW-WAGE WORKERS<|>PERSON<|>Low-wage workers are individuals in precarious employment situations who are particularly vulnerable to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS<|>EBOLA OUTBREAK<|>Civil society organizations played a critical role in public health education during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONG KONG<|>CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS<|>In Hong Kong, civil society organizations mobilized ordinary people to provide essential supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE GOVERNMENT<|>CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS<|>The Chinese government has restricted the activities of civil society organizations, impacting their ability to respond to health crises<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITALY<|>CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS<|>In Italy, civil society organizations faced challenges due to government-imposed quarantines while assisting migrants<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VENEZUELA<|>CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS<|>Civil society organizations in Venezuela are struggling to provide basic services due to the country's healthcare infrastructure issues<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARACAS<|>VENEZUELA<|>Caracas, as the capital of Venezuela, is central to the healthcare challenges faced by the country during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>Human Rights Watch advocates for the support of humanitarian operations carried out by the United Nations during crises<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOW-WAGE WORKERS<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>Human Rights Watch has called for protections for low-wage workers who are disproportionately affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
