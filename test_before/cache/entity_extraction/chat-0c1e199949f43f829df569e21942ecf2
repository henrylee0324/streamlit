Hartman, the senior vice president of the Central PA Korean Association, said she was accosted during the walk\nby four young men shouting at her.\n\"There were a group of four males who began taunting me, yelling, calling me the coronavirus, throwing their arms towards me,\" she\nsaid.\nBecause she had her 3-year-old daughter with her, Hartman said she didn't want to react.\n\"You could tell these four males are very angry and in their tone profanities, and my 3 year old was waving at them. She thought, 'oh\nlook, they're saying hello to me,'\" she said.\nHartman didn't report the incident to the police or state officials. Instead, she reported it to the Community Responders Network, a\ngrassroots coalition that works to reduce bias incidents in central Pennsylvania.\nHer account was the third report on a list of 33 for 2020. The first report describes an unknown man in a pickup truck driving past an\nAsian American Dickinson College student and yelling, blaming her for the coronavirus.\nThat was last March, when there were less than 50 reported cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. Since then, the virus and\ndiscrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have grown in the state.\nWhile the Community Responders Network has tallied at least 33 incidents, Chad Lassiter, the executive director of the Pennsylvania\nHuman Relations Commission, is reluctant to quote a figure, but recognized there has been an increase.\n\"We've seen an uptick throughout the state. It's challenging to gather numbers. Often times, these incidents go unreported or\nunderreported,\" he said.\nFor example, Hartman did not report her case to the state Human Relations Commission.\nThe uptick in Pennsylvania is in line with what's happening nationally:\nThe New York Police Department reported a 1,900% increase in reported hate crimes against Asian Americans in 2020.\nAlmost daily reports from the Bay Area of California show an increase in violence against Asian Americans, particularly elderly Asian\nAmericans.\nStop AAPI Hate, a database that has tracked racial violence during the coronavirus, received more than 2,800 reports of anti-Asian\ndiscrimination from March through the end of December.\nA rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans\nDiscrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders continue to be reported this year.\nShortly after taking office in January, President Joe Biden signed an executive order Jan. 26, condemning racism, xenophobia and\nintolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\nThe order also instructed the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to issue guidance and best practices for advancing cultural\ncompetency, language access and sensitivity towards Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\nBiden also asked the U.S. Attorney General's Office to expand the collection of data and public reporting regarding hate incidents\nagainst Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\nOn Feb. 22, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf's Advisory Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs condemned recent attacks on Asian\nPacific Americans across the country and called for all Pennsylvanians to stand up against anti-Asian hate and racism in all forms.\n\"From Oakland, California to Brooklyn, New York, innocent Asian elders have been severely injured or killed in wanton acts of violence.\nHere in Pennsylvania, witnesses have reported more insidious forms of hate, including threats of bodily harm to Asian American high\nschool students and the casual use of the term \"COVID\" to name Asian-influenced food,\" a statement from the governor's office said.\nBut discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is not a new problem. It's an injustice that has been pervasive for\ndecades.\nReporting and documenting\nHartman said she has experienced racist hate crimes since childhood. Growing up outside Philadelphia, her family's house was tarred\nwith swastikas, a brick was thrown through her sister's window, and an attempt was even made to blow up her father's car.\nBut the perpetrators never faced justice, she said.Now that hate crimes and racism against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are getting more attention, Hartman and other Asian-\nAmericans in Central Pennsylvania point to some recent generators of bigotry.That includes disinformation surrounding the coronavirus and the words of former President Donald Trump, who called COVID-19 \"the\nChina virus\" and \"kung flu\" during his 2020 campaign stops in Pennsylvania and throughout his nationally televised speeches.\nHartman said the actions of Trump created an environment where scapegoating is permitted, accusing the former president of \"reducing\nus to the virus, dehumanizing us, and using phrases like 'the China virus' and the 'kung flu.'\n\"There is that stereotype, you know, the \"kung flu,\" said Joseph Romanoff, who is biracial and teaches Zumba classes at the New York\nFitness Club in Lebanon and whose mother came to the U.S. from the Philippines.\n\"But (this has) been going on for a long time. It's not in our heads.\"\nThe difference, he said, is that now, \"racist attacks are being recorded and documented on social media.\"\nState Rep. Patty Kim, D-Dauphin County, has served the 103rd district since 2013 and is a former Harrisburg city councilwoman. She\nsaid she has been concerned that many hateful incidents against Asian-Americans were going unreported.\n\"Growing up, I've had kids calling me names and pointing out I'm different. I thought that was the way of life,\" Kim said. \"People feel\nvery bad and embarrassed, and just want it to go away\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
