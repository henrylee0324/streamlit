We had a president who didn't believe in\nscience. We had underfunding of our public health institutions. It was a perfect storm.\"\nIn an effort to better understand how the virus exploited the country's strengths and exposed its weaknesses, USA TODAY\ninterviewed biologists and studied scientific genomic analysis, federal reports concerning super-spreading events, county\nmedical examiner's data from around the country, and state-level death and infection data.\nReporters used those sources to find and report the stories, many of them previously untold, of Americans in the path of\nthe virus.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of misinformation and confusion leading to a devastating failure to unite against a common threat.\nPiecemeal policies offered a dangerously hollow illusion of control and safety. Scientists, intermittently ignored and\nvillainized, were powerless. As citizens protested and rioted in response to racist police tactics, others detected a more\nsubtle form of prejudice in apathy toward a virus that disproportionately sickened Black and Brown Americans. Early\nignorance about the spread metastasized into partisan conspiracy-mongering and threats, leading to that most\nAmerican phenomenon: a health official with a bulletproof vest.\nThe novel coronavirus didn't start in the United States, but we have made it our own.\nMLK Jr. Day: Zero official deaths\nOn Jan. 23, Dr. Benhur Lee stayed up late in his Manhattan apartment, working through the global ramifications of the\nvirus Americans had been told was not a threat to them.\n\"We have it totally under control,\" Trump had said the day before when asked about the single known case in the United\nStates. \"It's one person, coming in from China.\"\nBut none of the early epidemiological research Lee was picking up from China, where the virus had killed thousands and\nbrought life to a standstill, suggested that assessment was correct.\nLee runs a research lab at Mount Sinai's medical school in New York City. He made a name for himself as an HIV\nresearcher in the early 2000s before moving on to tracking emerging viruses, becoming an expert on viruses such as\nnipah, the bat-borne sickness featured in the film \"Contagion.\"\nLee was one of thousands of scientists throughout the world who had since December been piecing together small\nstudies from doctors in other countries to understand the features of the virus that had emerged in Wuhan, with their\nclues as to how it could be stopped.\nIn early January, scientists from China and Australia released an initial genome sequence of the virus. It closely\nresembled SARS, the virus that much of the world barely dodged two decades earlier. And on this Thursday night, Lee\ncouldn't sleep because scientists had just released new findings estimating the human-to-human spread of the novel\ncoronavirus.\nIt was as infectious as Ebola, slightly less infectious than the 1918 Spanish flu, and much less infectious than HIV and\nmalaria. Lee tried to put the data in context by tweet. Over next few months, his Twitter account – @VirusWhisperer –\nwould gain tens of thousands of followers.\nLee knew that the United States had previously benefited from a mix of luck and coordination between U.S. agencies\nand their international counterparts in stemming SARS and Ebola. That history was cold comfort to Lee, who knew that\nthe factors making a virus dangerous were difficult to predict.\nThe scientific community was not yet in agreement that the virus was capable of asymptomatic spread. Because carriers\noften don't know they have it and in turn don't isolate, asymptomatic spread is a boon for a virus's rate of infection.\nLee didn't need a double-blind study to determine what was happening. The way the virus had blitzed across China was\nevidence enough.\n\"There was obviously asymptomatic transmission going on,\" Lee said.\nOver the next few weeks, Lee would witness a study in contrasts in how seriously major nations were taking the novel\ncoronavirus. On Jan. 25, he left for a microbiology conference in Sydney, stopping on the way in his home country of\nSingapore. It was the beginning of the Year of the Rat, and Lee was celebrating the holiday with a visit to his parents.\nHe landed just as news broke that Singapore had its first confirmed case, in a traveler from Wuhan. Officials with latex\ngloves and temperature guns checked for fever as he disembarked and boarded, and travelers from the Chinese\nprovince that includes Wuhan were barred from entering the country.\nBy the time Lee returned to the United States on Feb. 3, there were confirmed cases on both coasts and in the\nMidwest, and officials were announcing new ones every couple of days.\nAs he disembarked in Newark, New Jersey, Lee readied for the temperature check, the symptom screening, even the\nracial profiling of an Asian traveler.\nInstead, he checked in at a digital kiosk just as he always did. There was no temperature check. The border official\nwelcomed him into the country with no screening questions.\nAs he rolled his luggage out of the airport, Lee thought, That's not good.\n***\nFor Dr. Jeff Smith, the top administrative official of Santa Clara County in California's Bay Area, it was a forgettable\ntopic of conversation, just one spouse griping about work to another.\nIn December 2019, Smith – who in addition to being county executive is also a medical doctor and a lawyer – was\nchatting with his wife, a primary care doctor befuddled recently\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country that faced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, including political and public health issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus pandemic that emerged in late 2019 and had widespread effects on public health and society.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANNEY<|>PERSON<|>Ranney is a public health expert who commented on the conditions in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USA TODAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>USA TODAY is a news organization that reported on the impact of COVID-19 in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
