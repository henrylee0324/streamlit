Twenty-five reports came in response to two anti-Chinese messages written in chalk, one outside the Walgreens on State and Lake Streets and another near the Humanities Building.\nIn a letter to Chancellor Rebecca Blank's office, a group of Chinese faculty members asked the university to investigate and condemn the incidents and said the university is \"faced with a grave challenge to our daily life, while carrying on our academic duties to the best of our abilities in such trying times.\" It was signed by over 1,000 people.\n\"COVID-19 has affected all of us personally, academically and professionally, as well as physically, mentally, and socially,\" Blank said in a statement last week. \"Even so, it's important to remember: No one person, country, or ethnicity created this pandemic - disease does not discriminate.\"\nFriedman said that the graffiti has been removed and the university is working with city police to find video footage.\nTown hall participants submitted text questions to panelists from the Multicultural Student Center, International Student Services and the Division of Diversity, Equity and Educational Achievement. Panelists said recent incidents have involved people coughing on individuals wearing masks or gloves, increasing stigma about wearing protective equipment in public, which Dean of Students Christina Olstad called \"disgusting\" and \"unacceptable.\"\nThe graffiti is no isolated incident. Despite much earlier calls from groups from the World Health Organization and the Asian American Association of Journalists to describe COVID-19 with scientific and neutral language, analyses show increased racist rhetoric online. Earlier in March, the term \"Chinese virus,\" which was used in the graffiti, was widely circulated online after a tweet using the term was posted by President Donald Trump.\nA new online reporting forum, Stop AAPI Hate, received over 650 direct reports in just one week, according to NBC Asian America.\nOne of the faculty who drafted the letter, who asked to remain anonymous, said Asian faculty have experienced cases of discrimination over their past decade at UW-Madison, amid a largely welcoming environment. The recent pandemic, however, has \"triggered and fanned this racial hatred and intolerance, and made it more publicly visible,\" the Chinese faculty members said.\nWhen asked how students could better organize against racism and bias, professor Cindy I-fen Cheng advised students to fight isolation from a place of connection and community.\n\"There's places for hurt and anger ... but how do we bring out the best values, the kind of world that we would like to live in?\" said Cheng, director of the Asian American Studies Program. \"Remember your student groups, remember who your safety people are and, when you feel hurt, go to them.\"\nChinese faculty and students have generally found support from their peers this week, the faculty member said. Immediately following the incident, they found themselves crying and shaking for a couple of hours, though \"great families and supportive colleagues\" calmed them down.\nSamantha McCabe, interim director of International Student Services, extended a message of encouragement to international students, whom she said make up about 15% of UW-Madison's student population.\n\"You are not voiceless in this,\" McCabe said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Wisconsin-Madison is an educational institution that has been addressing responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and incidents of hate and racism on campus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENNA FRIEDMAN<|>PERSON<|>Jenna Friedman is the assistant director of bias response at the Dean of Students Office at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REBECCA BLANK<|>PERSON<|>Rebecca Blank is the Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison who addressed the impact of COVID-19 on the university community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTINA OLSRAD<|>PERSON<|>Christina Olstad is the Dean of Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who commented on the unacceptable nature of recent incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINDY I-FEN CHENG<|>PERSON<|>Cindy I-fen Cheng is a professor and director of the Asian American Studies Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an online reporting forum that received numerous reports of anti-Asian incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected individuals and communities, leading to increased incidents of racism and bias, particularly against Asian individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF JOURNALISTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian American Association of Journalists is a group that has called for the use of scientific and neutral language regarding COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization is an international public health agency that has advocated for accurate and non-discriminatory language in describing COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALGREENS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Walgreens is a pharmacy chain where anti-Chinese messages were found written in chalk.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMANITIES BUILDING<|>GEO<|>The Humanities Building is a location at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where anti-Chinese messages were found.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NBC ASIAN AMERICA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NBC Asian America is a media outlet that reported on the number of direct reports received by Stop AAPI Hate.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JENNA FRIEDMAN<|>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON<|>Jenna Friedman works at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as the assistant director of bias response<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REBECCA BLANK<|>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON<|>Rebecca Blank is the Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, overseeing its operations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTINA OLSRAD<|>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON<|>Christina Olstad is the Dean of Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, responsible for student affairs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CINDY I-FEN CHENG<|>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON<|>Cindy I-fen Cheng is a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, contributing to the academic environment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Stop AAPI Hate received reports related to incidents that have increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF JOURNALISTS<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The Asian American Association of Journalists has called for neutral language regarding the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The World Health Organization has advocated for accurate language in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WALGREENS<|>HUMANITIES BUILDING<|>Anti-Chinese messages were found outside Walgreens and near the Humanities Building, indicating a connection to the incidents discussed<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NBC ASIAN AMERICA<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>NBC Asian America reported on the activities and reports received by Stop AAPI Hate<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
