It revealed that while such\ncrimes in 2020 decreased overall by 7 percent, those targeting Asian people rose by nearly 150 percent, NBC\nNews reported.\nKarthick Ramakrishnan, founder and director of demographic data and policy research nonprofit AAPI Data, told\nNBC Asian America that while the uptick cannot be entirely attributed to the Donald Trump administration's\nincendiary, racist rhetoric about the coronavirus, he believes Trump's wielding of the fact that the virus\noriginated in China and repeated elevation of the China virus rhetoric did play a part in fostering hate.\nWhat Trump did is that he weaponized it in a way, Ramakrishnan said.\nTrump's rhetoric helps set a certain narrative in place - and presidents have an outsized role in terms of shaping\nnarrative. They don't call it a bully pulpit for nothing, and especially Trump, the way he frequently used Twitter\nas well as press conferences and off-the-cuff remarks to campaign rallies to frame the narrative in a particular\nway, it likely played a role, Ramakrishnan added.\nThe analysis revealed a surge in cities such as New York, where anti-Asian hate crimes rose from three in 2019\nto 28 in 2020, a 833 percent increase. Los Angeles and Boston also experienced notable rises, from seven to 15\nand six to 14, respectively. Meanwhile, Washington, D.C., experienced a decline from six to three anti-Asian hate\ncrimes. Chicago remained unchanged, with two crimes each year.\nThough New York accounts for a sizable portion of the increase, Ramakrishnan stated the increases in other\ncities are significant.\nWe also know that first-generation immigrants tend to underreport acts of racial discrimination and hate crimes,\nbut the fact that we are talking about change data suggests a meaningful shift that likely means not just greater\nreporting, but actually greater occurrence, he continued.\nAccording to the analysis, it's likely that overall hate crimes declined due to the pandemic and a subsequent lack\nof interaction in public areas and other gathering places including public transit, commercial businesses, schools\nand houses of worship.\nThe first spike in anti-Asian hate crimes occurred in March and April last year. However, it occurred alongside a\nrise in COVID-19 cases and ongoing negative associations of Asian Americans with the virus, the analysis noted.\nRamakrishnan explained that research on Trump's use of racist language in reference to other groups shows\nthat his language did have a profound impact on how people behave toward marginalized groups.\nHe noted a 2020 study that examined Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants during his presidential\ncampaign - when he referred to them as rapists and declared that when Mexico sends its people, they're not\nsending the best - found that the inflammatory remarks emboldened certain members of the American public\nand gave them license to express deeply held prejudices. Researchers dubbed this the Trump effect or\nemboldening effect.\nTrump's rhetoric on Latinos in 2016 actually changed people's attitudes and behavior towards Latinos,\nRamakrishnan, who worked on the study, said, adding, So they were more likely to be punitive towards Latinos\nin the workplace.\nA separate study revealed that the use of China virus language to refer to the coronavirus, particularly by GOP\nofficials and conservative outlets, has already resulted in a shift in how many people in the US perceive Asian\nAmericans. The significant uptick in discriminatory coronavirus speech that occurred on March 8 - the day Rep.\nPaul Gosar, R-Ariz., tweeted about the Wuhan virus, which coincided with then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's\ninterview the day before on \"Fox and Friends\" in which he referred to the \"China virus\" - was followed by a rapid\nreversal of a decadelong decline in anti-Asian bias.\nResearch suggests that when people see Asian Americans as being more 'foreign', they are more likely to\nexpress hostility toward them and engage in acts of violence and discrimination, Rucker Johnson, a public policy\nprofessor at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-author of the study, previously told NBC Asian\nAmerica.\nThe new report, however, compares figures from 2019 and 2020, which does not include recent graphic attacks\non Asian American elders earlier this year that have prompted significant media coverage in recent weeks. Many\noutlets have attributed the attacks to rhetoric that Trump used during his tenure. But Ramakrishnan cautioned\nagainst defaulting to a simplistic understanding of what's going on.\nThere's a complex variety of factors, but the fundamental reality is that there's an increase in the number of\nAsian Americans who feel unsafe, he stated.\nHe added more data on the current situation will become available in another year, and until then, it's difficult to\ndefinitively declare that there's been an increase in hate crimes of late. It's possible, Ramakrishnan said, that what Asian Americans were going through a year ago was just as bad or worse but failed to receive the kind\nof media attention they're getting now.\nHe also said there's likely a confluence of factors that have contributed to the recent attacks on elders, and it\ncannot be neatly summed up by solely the heightened anti-Asian sentiment witnessed throughout the\npandemic.\nRamakrishnan added there could be a combination of the effects of poverty and financial struggle as well as\nopportunity at play.\nNot everyone reacts to economic deprivation in the same way.
