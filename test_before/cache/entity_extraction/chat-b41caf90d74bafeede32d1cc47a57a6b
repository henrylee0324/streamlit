Not only did we have to fight COVID-19, as a minority living in this\ncountry we also had to fight racism,\" Au said. \"I'm glad that there's a huge turnout today and see so many\ndifferent groups supporting us.\"\nThe rally held outside the Nassau County Legislative Building drew about 300 attendees, many of whom held up\nsigns that said \"END VIOLENCE AGAINST ASIANS\" and \"Justice for Grandpa VICHA,\" the first name of Vicha\nRatanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai man who died in January after being slammed onto the pavement in San Francisco. Ratanapakdee's death was one of the violent assaults that ignited a national outcry over the\ndiscrimination and harassment that some Asian Americans said they've endured since the pandemic began.\nPresident Joe Biden in a nationally televised speech last Thursday condemned violence against Asian Americans.\n\"One year later today, we already have the vaccines for the virus, but the hate and crime against Asian\nAmericans are still running out of control,\" said Gordon Zhang, president of the Long Island Chinese American\nAssociation.\nIn an emotional speech, Zhang evoked the history of minorities being \"scapegoated\" in times of crisis, pointing\nto the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Japanese internment camps during World War II.\n\"But today, it's not the 1880s. It's not the 1940s. We are in the year of 2021,\" Zhang said. \"We can't have the\nugly and painful history repeat itself again.\"\nAfter recounting several attacks in recent months, Zhang said the reported cases only represent \"the tip of the\niceberg\" as many incidents go unreported - something acknowledged by Nassau Police Commissioner Patrick\nRyder.\n\"I know there have been many that have not been reported because people are fearful,\" Ryder said. \"They\nshould come forward. We want you to know that your police officers, the men and women that stand out here to\nprotect you today, took an oath to protect and serve.\"\nThe crowd occasionally broke into chants of \"stop the hate\" as elected officials as well as leaders from the\nNAACP, Jewish and Muslim groups called for unity.\n\"We are not looking for any different way of treating us,\" said Sen. Kevin Thomas (D-Levittown), who arrived at\nthe United States at the age of 10. He is the state's first Indian American state senator. \"Just treat us the same\nas everyone else.\"\nAs Thomas and others spoke, Young Ono of Stewart Manor waved a \"#STOP ASIAN HATE\" sign along with her\ndaughter, Alexandra, 7, who held a second sign that said: \"HATE IS A VIRUS.\" The mother of two wrote the\nletters and her daughter and son Jayson, 3, decorated the signs with color-filled hearts and stars.\n\"Watching all these people getting hurt reminded me so much of my own parents and grandparents,\" said Ono,\nwhose parents emigrated from South Korea. \"It's important for me to show support and show my children that\nit's important to show support for something like this.\"\nHarry Woodrow, 73, of Westbury, heard about the rally from his temple in Jericho. With friend Sharyn Levine,\nthey decided to come out to show solidarity.\n\"There's so much hate in our country, not only toward Asians ... but toward various ethnic groups,\" Woodrow\nsaid. \"This is a small way to stand against it and just be part of a crowd.
