This year, I'm looking forward to a more hopeful and united year.\"\nAs the holiday typically invites reflection, three Long Islanders spoke to Newsday of their family rituals and the\nnew year's outlook.\nYeonwoo Lee\nLunar New Year for Lee, 16, conjures up memories of devouring Tteokguk, a rice cake soup, and sending videos\nto her relatives in South Korea of her donning a hanbok, a dress worn in her native country during special\noccasions.\nThe high school sophomore said she was a toddler when she moved to the United States from Seoul, and the\nholiday is a way for her to reconnect with her heritage.\n\"It ties me back to my culture since I've been living in America my whole life,\" Lee said. \"Celebrating the new\nyear with my family makes me feel more Korean.\"\nLee, of Plainview, recalled another holiday custom of receiving money from loved ones. In her family, children\nare gifted between $10 and $200, meant to represent a prosperous future, she said.\n\"I remember receiving money from relatives, and I remember being happy. We have to receive it with two\nhands\" as a \"sign of respect,\" she said.\nBecause of the pandemic, Lee said this year's festivities will be limited to her home with only her immediate\nfamily.\nShe said the struggles over the past year and yearning for a better future are emblematic in 2021's celebrations\nof the year of the Ox, an animal that is said to symbolize hard work and perseverance.\n\"The pandemic requires a lot of resilience from everyone,\" the teen said.\nThe COVID-19 crisis, however difficult, has given her a newfound appreciation of her South Korean bloodlines\nand the traditions that come with them, she said.\n\"I often viewed these kinds of family gatherings as an inconvenience. Sometimes, I would rather stay home,\"\nLee said. \"I realized how much I took for granted and how much I enjoyed these gatherings. From now on, I will\nvalue them more.\"\nWai-Lin Ng\nNg's fondest holiday memories include gatherings with her family in New York City, where she cooked dumplings\nfor hours while partaking in upbeat conversations.\n\"The Chinese dumplings - that was always a must-have,\" said Ng, 57, of Sound Beach. \"It was my parents,\naunts and their friends. Dumplings made by hand, it only takes a few minutes to eat them, so you have to\nconstantly be making them all day.\"\nMaintaining pleasantries to abide by the holiday spirit of prosperity was a must, Ng said.\n\"There was always good conversations and never bad words spoken,\" she said, adding it's \"bad luck\" to spoil the\npositive vibes.\nThe pandemic has prompted Ng to pivot away from face-to-face celebrations like cooking traditional meals with\nrelatives and attending lion dances, in which performers wear an elaborate, colorful head ornament and move to\nthe rhythms of drumbeats, in Chinatown in Manhattan.\nInstead, Ng plans to attend a virtual celebration and video chat with college classmates who live abroad in\ncountries like Singapore and Japan.The 2021 Lunar New Year takes on even more significance in the effort to move on from an uptick in hate-\nrelated crimes and reports of discrimination against Asians, Ng said.She had one such negative encounter last winter at a Rocky Point grocery store. It occurred before masks\nbecame a common protective measure. Ng said a woman stared at her and then pulled her scarf over her\nnose and mouth.\nShe hasn't experienced another similar interaction since, but the moment stuck with her, said Ng, who was\nborn in Hong Kong and emigrated to the United States when she was a child.\n\"At the time, I felt a little embarrassed,\" said Ng, who has lived on the Island for most of her adult life. \"I\nonly realized it when I started to think about all the rhetoric that was going on and why people would do\nsomething like that. For a while, it made me a little angry.\"\nTo combat anti-Asian sentiments, Ng said raising awareness of Asian culture is key.\n\"The more we do to engage other Asians in the community, and the more we share in culture and language,\nis the only way we overcome these stereotypes and cultural barriers,\" she said.\nKevin Quan\nThe Lunar New Year was \"a special day\" for Quan when he was growing up in Jamaica, Queens.\nThat day started special with no school.\nInstead, his parents would drive him and his siblings to Chinatown in Manhattan to visit their grandparents,\nrelatives and friends. By the end of the day, he would go home with dozens of money-filled red envelopes,\nknown as hongbao.\n\"It seemed that whole day, every single adult except your parents would give you something,\" he recalled\nwith a laugh. \"When you were a little child, you never had your own money. Receiving hongbao was exciting.\nIt didn't happen\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
