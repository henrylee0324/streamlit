The saliva splattered on his jacket.\nNguyen, who is of Vietnamese and Filipino descent, had imagined this moment. Having read news stories about harassment and attacks against Asians as coronavirus cases\nrose, he wondered if he would be next. If he was, he thought he would take a stand on behalf of himself and other Asians.\nBut as he wiped the saliva off with his sleeve, he and his friend -- of South Asian descent -- hurried away without a word to the assailant.\n\"In that instance, I was just kind of shocked, or dumbfounded, of what occurred,\" Nguyen said.\nNguyen worries that East Asians in the United States will face even more harassment and attacks as coronavirus cases continue to rise. He said he believes President Donald\nTrump stoked such hate-filled reaction during a news briefing last week when he defended his use of \"Chinese virus.\"\n\"It's not racist at all,\" Trump said. \"I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China.\" He also said he was using the expression to fight back against Beijing\nofficials who were blaming the U.S. military for the introduction of the disease.\nThe World Health Organization has recommended people use coronavirus or COVID-19, stating that other characterizations spread negative stereotypes.\nOn Monday, Trump appeared to walk back his earlier position, using the word \"coronavirus\" and stressing it was important to \"totally protect our Asian American community.\"\n\"Yes, it seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country,\" he admitted. \"I don't like that at all. These are incredible people,\nthey love our country and I'm not going to let it happen.\"\nBut Nguyen fears it's too late. Since the president and other politicians first used the term, Nguyen and other Asians in Chicago said they have felt growing apprehension that\npeople take the president's comments as a license for racism.\nElsewhere in the U.S., reports of hate crimes have cropped up from New York to San Francisco, some caught on video and circulated through social media. In California's San\nFernando Valley, a 16-year-old was sent to the emergency room after being beat up and accused of having the coronavirus at his high school, CBS News reported.\n\"It's outrageous,\" said state Rep. Theresa Mah from the 2nd District, which includes Chicago's Chinatown. \"Chinese Americans and constituents of mine understand this is a\nsituation in which they could potentially be scapegoats for the uncertainty people feel.\"\n'History is repeating itself'\nMabel Menard was sitting alone at her favorite neighborhood tavern in Old Town earlier this month when she noticed an unfamiliar face.\nA man, very intoxicated, made eye contact with her and said, \"Do you have the corona?\"\nMenard, a 58-year-old Chinese American, said she didn't think twice before quipping, \"I'm having a wine.\"\nThe bar's staff kicked the man out.\n\"I kind of thought he was an idiot,\" Menard said. \"That's the kind of mentality that you walk around with, thinking that you're better than anybody else, and the way to make\nyou feel better is to be nasty to other people. I think that's pretty sad.\"\nTuyet Anh, 20, said she was sitting alone on a Red Line train one day late in February, headed south from Lakeview to DePaul University, where she is a junior, when she noticed\ntwo men whispering.\n\"Got to get our masks on,\" one of them said.\nTuyet Anh, who did not want her last name used, looked away. One of the men wondered aloud, \"Oh, do you think she heard us?\"\n\"I felt at first just very shocked,\" Tuyet Anh said. \"Really? Someone would say that? But then processing it more, I just felt a little nervous and that feeling of being under\nsurveillance, almost.\"\nTuyet Anh, who is of Vietnamese descent, has since been saddened to read social media comments from her fellow classmates using the terms \"Chinese virus\" and \"Wu flu.\"\nShe wasn't surprised, given that the first phrase was picked up by Trump.\n\"It makes me and other Asian Americans feel as if we are the virus,\" Tuyet Anh said. \"We are labeled and demonized as this threat to white American safety.\"\nMenard, president of Chicago's chapter of the advocacy group OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates, said the tense environment reminds her of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act\nbarring Chinese immigrants from entering the country, the first immigration law to exclude an ethnic group, as well as the World War II Japanese internment camps forcing\nJapanese Americans into incarceration.\n\"History is repeating itself,\" Menard said. \"If we looked at the history of Asian Americans in the U.S., we've always been either held up as a model minority -- that despite the\ndiscrimination, we're still doing well -- or we're demonized because when something like this happens, it's all our fault.\"\nAsian American organizations last week launched the #WashTheHate campaign on social media, highlighting stories of coronavirus-related racism. The Asian Pacific Policy and\nPlanning Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action groups also started collecting reports of incidents of hostility against Asians.\nIn less than a week, more than 400 reports surfaced\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
