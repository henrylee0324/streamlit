Court documents give the victim's name as Gilbert Diaz, and Carl Chan, a community leader and president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, said the victim was Latino. But Mr. Chan says he has tallied more than two dozen assaults against Asian-American victims in Chinatown, including two other people shoved by the assailant who knocked down Mr. Diaz.Crime data from the district attorney offices in San Francisco County and Alameda County, which includes Oakland, show that people of Asian descent were less likely last year to be victims of crimes than other ethnic groups. In San Francisco, where 36 percent of the population is of Asian descent, 16 percent of crime victims of known ethnicity were Asian, a similar situation to Alameda County.But leaders of the Bay Area Asian community say crime statistics are misleading because Asian-American residents, especially immigrants, often do not report assaults or robberies out of mistrust of the system or language barriers. What is incontrovertible, say leaders of the Asian-American community nationwide, is that the pandemic created a climate of fear and a feeling of insecurity from New York to California. In the past week the California Legislature approved $1.4 million in funding to track and research racist incidents against Asian-Americans.\"Our seniors are afraid to walk their own streets,\" Mr. Chan said.Last year Ms. Monthanus, Mr. Vicha's daughter, was twice accosted on the street by people who told her to leave the country because, the attackers said, Asians had caused the coronavirus.Mr. Watson's lawyer, Sliman Nawabi, a public defender, said his client would not have been able to identify Mr. Vicha's ethnicity through his face mask, cap and winter clothing. Mr. Nawabi described Mr. Watson as someone who had struggled with anger.In the hours before the attack, Mr. Watson had a string of setbacks. He left his home because of a family dispute and got in a traffic accident in San Francisco at 2 a.m. He was cited by the San Francisco police for running a stop sign and reckless driving and then slept that night in his car.On that morning a number of security cameras in the area captured Mr. Watson banging a car with his hand, according to Mr. Boudin, the district attorney.\"It appears that the defendant was in some sort of a temper tantrum,\" Mr. Boudin said.It was then that Mr. Vicha walked up Anzavista Avenue, a street with views of skyscrapers in the city's financial district.A witness told police officers that Mr. Watson said something to the effect of \"What are you looking at?\" A security camera located inside a neighbor's apartment captured Mr. Watson charging across the pavement toward Mr. Vicha, who briefly turned to his assailant before the impact.Two days after the attack, Ms. Monthanus and her mother went to the spot where Mr. Vicha was killed and saw that his blood still stained the pavement. They scrubbed the sidewalk with brushes and wondered why no one from the city had come to do the same.Mr. Vicha's cremated remains have been placed in two urns. Ms. Monthanus says she and her family will charter a boat under the Golden Gate Bridge and scatter some into the Pacific Ocean.\"I want him to be close to me,\" she said. \"When we go to the beach we can dream that he is with us.\"She plans to bring the other urn back to her father's hometown in southern Thailand, where the local Buddhist temple has a stupa that holds the family's remains. \"His brothers and sisters are there,\" Ms. Monthanus said. \"They will all be together.\"The amulet, a precious family heirloom, will be passed to the next generation, Ms. Monthanus said.\"He always told me that if something happened to him, this must be passed on to grandchildren,\" she said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GILBERT DIAZ<|>PERSON<|>Gilbert Diaz is a 91-year-old man who was assaulted in Oakland's Chinatown and has been misidentified in news reports as Asian, while he is actually Latino.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARL CHAN<|>PERSON<|>Carl Chan is a community leader and president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, who has reported on the assaults against Asian-American victims in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where the assault on Gilbert Diaz took place, specifically in its Chinatown area.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California, part of the same region as Oakland, where crime statistics regarding Asian descent victims were analyzed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALAMEDA COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Alameda County is a region in California that includes Oakland and where crime data was reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The California Legislature is the legislative body that approved $1.4 million in funding to track and research racist incidents against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MS.
