Naperville police are investigating.\nChen, an advisory board member of United Chinese Americans Illinois Chapter, is urging the Naperville City Council to adopt a resolution condemning racism and supporting Asian Americans.\nViral racism: Since March 19, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council’s STOP AAPI HATE reporting center has received more than 1,100 reports nationwide of coronavirus-related discrimination against Asian Americans.\nA majority of incidents occurred in grocery stores, pharmacies and big box retail stores, the center reports.\nChen said there’s been a rise in anti-Asian sentiment and hate crimes in the wake of President Donald Trump and other politicians labeling COVID-19 a \"Chinese virus.\"\nTo report a hate crime, visit a3pcon.org/stopaapihate.\nE-learning access gaps: Suburban educators are realizing gaps in student access to e-learning due to technological challenges affecting low- income and minority families.\nAt Elgin Area School District U-46, officials are seeing a significant drop in participation among Hispanic and African American students. Attendance rates post-COVID-19 lockdown declined during the first week of distance learning — from 95% to 90% among Asians, from 94% to 89% among whites, from 92% to 76% among Hispanics, and from 90% to 66% among blacks.\n\"Internet access is obviously a big issue with some families,\" U-46 Superintendent Tony Sanders said. \"We are working on a solution for that.

For blacks, it’s harder to build that trust when most doctors don’t look like them, and that can be an issue in the suburbs, experts say.\n\"To open yourself up and be vulnerable, you want to do that typically among people who understand the nuances,\" said Dr. Courtney Coke, an African American radiation oncologist at Advocate Sherman Hospital in Elgin. \"That vulnerability requires certain sensibility on the part of physicians.\nHistorically, patients who are of diverse backgrounds may not feel comfortable venturing outside of their traditional spaces.\" Having a culturally competent physician empowers patients, he added.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
