You know when they see me, I stand out.”He sees this as a good thing. He wants people to ask him for help.\nRelated: A Black radio host calls on South Asian Americans to reject racism\nSakhone is the director of housing services at Family Bridges, a nonprofit in Oakland, California, and he’s also\npart of the area's Community Ambassador program.\nCommunity ambassadors walk the streets of Chinatown to care for the neighborhood and help residents feel\nsafe. They do things like sweep sidewalks, fix kids’ bikes and help with vaccine clinics.\nAttacks against Asian Americans have increased across the country over the last year - including racial slurs shouted in public, kids bullied in schools, and most recently, the unpredictable attacks on older Asian Americans.\nSome say the uptick can be linked to rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump, who dubbed the\ncoronavirus the “China virus” in public remarks.\nAn 84-year old man from Thailand was attacked and knocked to the ground during his morning walk in San\nFrancisco. He died two days later. In another incident, a 61-year-old Filipino American was slashed in the face on\nthe New York City subway.\nOakland's Chinatown has also seen attacks like this. In a virtual tour of the area via FaceTime, Sakhone shows\nthe spot where a 91-year-old man was shoved to the ground a few weeks ago. He said he regrets that he wasn’t\nthere to help.\n“Yeah, if I see them fall down, I'll rush to help,” Sakhone said. “I always keep an eye on them.”\nRelated: Backlash over anti-racist billboard challenges Houston's Vietnamese American community\n------------\nSakhone walks the streets of Chinatown every morning as shopkeepers set up their fruit stands and seniors take\ntheir morning strolls. He greets many of them by name.\nA grocer runs over to give him a bag of fresh oranges when he spots Sakhone coming down the street. Take it,\nhe gestures with his hands. Sakhone will share it when he brings a cup of coffee to a man sleeping on the\nstreets a few blocks away.\nMost residents here speak Cantonese, but Sakhone, whose family is from Laos, does not. Yet, they still manage\nto communicate by tapping him on the shoulder or waving him over when they need help - like the time an\nelderly woman had her walker stolen.\nSakhone and the woman went in search of it together but her knee buckled every few steps as they canvassed\nthe streets. Eventually, he bought her a new walker, he recalled.\n“A lot of folks are worried. ... But at the same time, when I'm around, they know that I'm there to help look\nover them.”\nSakhone Lasaphangthong, community ambassador, Chinatown, Oakland, California\n“A lot of folks are worried,” Sakhone said, and some older residents aren’t even leaving their homes with the\nrise in attacks. “But at the same time, when I'm around, they know that I'm there to help look over them.”\nJust the presence of ambassadors like Sakhone seems to make a difference.\nRelated: Racism against African Americans in China escalates\nBut building this kind of trust took time given that the Community Ambassadors initiative didn’t start as a\nneighborhood watch program. It started in 2017 to help give former inmates from San Quentin prison the\nopportunity to do dignified work and rebuild relationships with the community.\n------------\nSakhone had been incarcerated for 20 years before he was released in 2018. To stop crime, he said you need to\nknow why it happens. He explained how in the pandemic, people have lost their jobs, rent prices in Oakland and\nelsewhere have skyrocketed, and many people have lost their homes, too. All these stresses can compound\nmental health.\n“They have no right to do it, but it's like one way that folks express their traumas and their hurt or their pain\nis to take it out on people,” Sakhone said. “And it's not right. But the pandemic is hard for every community -\nit's hard for everyone.”\nRelated: Xenophobia 'takes its toll' as Trump works to curb immigration\nA special police task force is being developed to address hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific\nIslanders in Oakland. But some community members say that in reality, most people here won’t call the\npolice given a history of mistrust and lack of response.\n“I don't believe in more policing, I believe in more communication so that we could avoid these kinds of hate\ncrimes from happening.\"\nSakhone Lasaphangthong, community ambassador, Chinatown, Oakland, California\n“I don't believe in more policing, I believe in more communication so that we could avoid these kinds of hate\ncrimes from happening,” Sakhone said.\nMany residents want justice for hate crime victims, while advocates like Sakhone believe in restorative\njustice. When he sees conflict or tension, he tries to deescalate the situation by understanding the\nperspectives of all those involved.\n“One of my approaches is to ask if they're OK. You know, 'What's going on? What do you need?'” he said.\nOnce home to immigrants and working-class families, the neighborhoods around Chinatown are gentrifying\nand now boast luxury condos, as well. Some locals say that people don’t know each other, and don't look out\nfor each other the way they\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
