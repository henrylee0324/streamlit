I have listened to\nthe stories of many members from the Chinese community since COVID-19 began spreading in the United\nStates early this year and Asian Americans first reported facing racial bias.\nClosing the notebook, I saw three faces in my mind's eye - they are filled with confusion, frustration and fear.\nNever more fearful\nJulie Tang had been a judge at the San Francisco Superior Court for 26 years. The person who understands\nmore of self-protection than average people said she was \"happy sheltering in my little condominium \"because\nshe did not want to risk being spit upon or told to go back to China.\nThough racial prejudice is not new to the Chinese immigrant who has lived in the US for 50 years, Tang said she\nhas never felt more fearful for her personal safety than now.\n\"I just don't want to confront it now because this is a very scary time. It is like going back to a war where you\ncan be shot at,\" she said. \"When racism rears its ugly head, we don't know if we can protect ourselves or our\nfamily.\"\nSome of my friends told me they sympathize with the fear of the retired judge even though they have not\nexperienced any incident yet.\nA friend said she has been relying on online grocery delivery since March just to avoid any potential racist\nincident.\nFirsthand experience\nSimon is a student of biology from China at the University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center. When he was\nshunned on the street while wearing a mask in March, he was not sure if the act was racist until he read the\nnews about rising racism against Asians.\nOne of the first violent racist attacks related to COVID-19 happened on March 14 in Midland, Texas. Three Asian\nAmerican family members, including a 2-year-old and a 6-year-old, were stabbed because the suspect thought\nthe family \"infected people with the coronavirus\".\nFor the first time in his life, Simon, who preferred to be called by first name only, said he searched the internet\nfor tips on how to respond to racist attacks.\n\"I think you would not understand the feeling of being discriminated against until you have experienced it\nyourself,\" he said.\nFinding support online\nElaine Peng is a mental health advocate and educator in the Bay Area.\nWhat aggravates the challenges that the pandemic has already posed for her service recipients is the US\ngovernment's attempted ban on WeChat.\nThe Chinese social networking app is like a lifeline for those who need her assistance, said Peng, because all\ntheir support groups are on WeChat and it is the only Chinese language communication app available in the US.\n\"I think the WeChat ban is targeting our Chinese communities. It's used to continue the government's racist\nagenda,\" Peng said.\nShe has since joined organizing efforts to raise awareness of anti-Asian racism, such as inviting elected officials\nand community members to speak up at online meetings and signing petitions to protest anti-China rhetoric.\nDuring a recent phone call, Simon told me he would stay and continue his study in the US, despite the pandemic\nand other challenges.\n\"As they say, a crisis brings out both the best and the worst in people. I'm glad to see there also are a lot of\npeople who believe in equality and stand against racism,\" he said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JULIE TANG<|>PERSON<|>Julie Tang is a retired judge who served at the San Francisco Superior Court for 26 years and has expressed fear regarding racial bias against the Chinese community during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO SUPERIOR COURT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The San Francisco Superior Court is a judicial institution where Julie Tang served as a judge.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMON<|>PERSON<|>Simon is a biology student from China studying at the University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center who has experienced racial bias during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS' MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center is an educational institution where Simon studies biology.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIDLAND<|>GEO<|>Midland is a city in Texas where one of the first violent racist attacks related to COVID-19 occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELAINE PENG<|>PERSON<|>Elaine Peng is a mental health advocate and educator in the Bay Area who raises awareness of anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WECHAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WeChat is a Chinese social networking app that serves as a vital communication tool for the Chinese community in the US.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has led to increased racial bias and violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULIE TANG<|>SAN FRANCISCO SUPERIOR COURT<|>Julie Tang served as a judge at the San Francisco Superior Court for 26 years<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMON<|>UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS' MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER<|>Simon is a student at the University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIDLAND<|>COVID-19<|>Midland is the location of one of the first violent racist attacks related to COVID-19<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELAINE PENG<|>WECHAT<|>Elaine Peng relies on WeChat to communicate with her service recipients and raise awareness of anti-Asian racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMON<|>COVID-19<|>Simon experienced racial bias during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULIE TANG<|>COVID-19<|>Julie Tang expressed fear regarding racial bias against the Chinese community during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELAINE PENG<|>COVID-19<|>Elaine Peng's advocacy work is aggravated by the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
