While the Chinese government seems to act more effectively, the US allows dissent, and at times, it\nis able to correct its own mistakes.\nAmerican education has made her “more anti-China,” Li says with a laugh.\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvard and MIT sued over the reversed decision to strip international\nstudents of visas if all their courses were online\nShe recalls feeling “very uncomfortable” when she first arrived in America six years ago and saw her fellow students\nwaving Taiwanese flags, which are seen in mainland China as a symbol for Taiwan independence.\nBut after getting to know the Taiwanese students, she realised that though their views may have been completely\ndifferent, they could discuss issues respectfully, which is encouraged in American classrooms.\n“Studying in the US is an important experience in my life,” one that she says she’d never regret. “But I am eager to\nhelp change China, where my work may be more meaningful.”\n© 2020 Yerepouni Daily News.
