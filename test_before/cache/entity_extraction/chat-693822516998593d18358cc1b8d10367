So, I explained to him ... not everybody's gonna like\nyou for who you are, some people are not gonna like the way you look but that doesn't matter.\n\"It doesn't change who you are, those people are the problem, not you.\"\nMitchell described the experience as \"disheartening.\"\n\"I'm more concerned about when he goes back to school, how he's going to be towards children that are\nCaucasian because I don't want him thinking, which is what I told him, ... that all white people are bad, just\ncertain types of people that choose to live a racist and prejudiced life,\" the McSherrystown resident said.\nMitchell said this is especially important being that his son's mother and her family are white.\nAs Black Lives Matter protests have swept the nation in the recent months, many claim that racist issues don't\nexist in small rural communities like Hanover and Gettysburg.\nIn response, some in these communities have stood up to unmask what life for a person of color in this area is\nreally like.\nLatrecia Thomas, of Harrisburg, has Black sons, and she said that the Black Lives Matter movement occurring\ntoday will hopefully pave the way for her children.\n\"Honestly, I hope that they don't have to scream out Black Lives Matter when they get older,\" the 29-year-old\nsaid. \"That me saying it now ... and us working on it now, that this whole racial adversity is, for the most part,\ngone by the time our children get older, so that they can live free and feel free.\"\nBlack Lives Matter Protests: 'I want to be treated like a human'\nTo Thomas, Black Lives Matter has a very simple meaning.\n\"The gist ... is: 'Hi, we're here. I'm a person. I want to be treated like a human, I respect you, you respect me,'\"\nThomas said.\nThe movement for her means community and a platform for Black people to share their grievances.\n\"It makes it all inclusive for all of us Black people to say your life does matter ... regardless of what your\ncircumstances are and regardless of what you've done. You don't deserve to be treated worse than anyone\nelse,\" Thomas said.\nShe attended recent protests in Harrisburg and Baltimore and said that she was able to have some very\nenlightening conversations with people because of it.\n\"That's probably my favorite way to protest, especially if someone's open to that conversation because we have\nto educate, we have to say like 'This is what I'm feeling and maybe you don't understand that because you\nhaven't taken the time to sit down and see that I had this real emotion behind that,'\" Thomas said.\nShe said she was happy to hear there were similar protests in Hanover, where she grew up.\nAnnie Henry, 24, was one of the organizers of the Black Lives Matter protest in Hanover on Sunday, May 31.\nNow, in the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian Americans like herself have experienced discrimination from those\nblaming the Asian community for the virus. Henry said that personal experience of being fearful of others\nmaking racist remarks gave her a glimpse at what Black people deal with every day.\nShe believes that it's important for people to know what kind of action they can take regarding these national\nissues.\n\"It is a privilege to not have to be involved in politics, a privilege that I could have if I chose not to, but I think\nit's important that we use the privileges we do have to help those who might not. It shouldn't be left up to the\npeople who are oppressed to fix the systems that oppress them,\" Henry said.\nShe admitted she did have some reservations about organizing the protest in Hanover.\n\"If you look at the demographics of (Hanover), statistically, it is a very white town, and when there's a\nhomogeneous population, it's sometimes difficult to understand other experiences and other perspectives,\"\nHenry said.\n\"When we don't see diversity, when we don't have diverse thoughts, then the way that our town functions is\ngoing to be from the white perspective. And that's not that people are being wrong, but it's understanding\nthat, and it's acknowledging that.\"\nDespite these reservations, \"I'm very happy we were able to do it peacefully and still impactfully.\"\nHenry also helped with the protest on Saturday, June 6, which was organized by the same person who\norganized various recent protests in Gettysburg and Hanover, Matthew Anselmi.\nAnselmi, of Gettysburg, is originally from Detroit where he said he lived in a poverty-stricken neighborhoods\nwith many Black families.\nHe said that from what he's seen on Facebook, many people think that the protests are just about George\nFloyd's death and charging the officers involved, but it's about much more.\n\"Granted, this most recent slaying by the police is what has ignited worldwide protests, but it's just one\ninstance that speaks to hundreds of years of injustices and I think it's really important to get this message\nout to rural America,\" the 31-year\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
