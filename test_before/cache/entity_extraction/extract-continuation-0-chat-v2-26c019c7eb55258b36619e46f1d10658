Miller, Trevor Hughes, Romina Ruiz-Goiriena, Jorge L. Ortiz, Jordan Culver\n\nUSA Today\n\n2021-03-23\n\nATLANTA – Most were dedicated mothers. Some came to the USA looking for a better life. One was an Army veteran working as a handyman. Some loved to dance and sing karaoke.\nAuthorities have identified all eight people killed last week in a string of attacks at three Atlanta-area spas. Six of the women were of Asian descent including four who were Korean.\nSoon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, and Yong Ae Yue were identified Friday by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's office as the four victims of the shootings at two spas in Atlanta. The medical examiner said Park, Grant, and Yue died of gunshot wounds to the head and Kim died of gunshot wounds to the chest.\nWednesday, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office released the names of the four victims at the spa about 30 miles north of Atlanta. Those killed at Young's Asian Massage were Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan, and Daoyou Feng. A 30-year-old Hispanic man was injured.\nMost of the women had sons and daughters who remembered them as close friends. They dedicated their lives to making sure their children were taken care of.\nOther victims included a woman who had been married less than a year and a brother who left behind more than half a dozen siblings.\nThe shooting came amid a spike in incidents of hate, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks such incidents.\nHere's what we know about the victims: \n\nHyun Jung Grant\nHyun Jung Grant, 51, loved karaoke, dancing, and clubs, and she made the world's best kimchi stew, her son Randy Park told USA TODAY.\n\"She dedicated her whole life to raising us but even then she found time to enjoy herself with her friends,\" Park, 22, said. \"I can't articulate or express in any way to describe what she was or what she meant to us.\"\nPark said he learned only recently that his mom worked in a massage parlor – she initially said it was a makeup parlor in an effort to protect her two boys.\nThe two Atlanta spas attacked by the shooter had been repeatedly targeted in prostitution investigations in the past 10 years, according to police records. The documents show that 10 people had been arrested on prostitution charges but none since 2013.\nThe suspect told police his sex addiction drove him to commit the crimes and Atlanta authorities confirmed the man had \"frequented\" the spas.\nPark said he understands why his mother wasn't forthcoming and said he feels selfish and guilty for invading her privacy by asking about it. He said they never talked about her work which sometimes kept her away from home for weeks at a time.\n\"What's so hard about letting people live how they want? If it does no harm to you who is it harming then?\" he asked.\n\nXiaojie Tan\nXiaojie Tan, 49, who owned Young's Asian Spa and one other in Acworth, Georgia, also went by her American name Emily. She was remembered as a curious, hardworking, and caring woman who was always filled with joy. \n\"She did everything for me and for the family. She provided everything. She worked every day, 12 hours a day, so that me and our family would have a better life,\" Tan's daughter Jami Webb told USA TODAY. \n\"She was full of smiles and laughter. She was just a pleasure to be around,\" said Michael Webb, Jami's father, who met Tan while traveling for work in China in the early 2000s.\nMichael Webb and Tan met in her native city of Nanning, which sits on the border with Vietnam. Neither spoke the other's language well but that didn't stop the pair from falling in love.\n\nDelaina Ashley Yaun\nDelaina Ashley Yaun, 33, leaves behind a 13-year-old son and 8-month-old daughter. She and her husband had been married less than a year.\nHer mother Margaret Rushing told WAGA-TV that her daughter and son-in-law went to the spa on a date. When gunfire broke out, Yaun's husband locked himself in a room and wasn't injured, said Yaun's half-sister Dana Toole. \n\"He's taking it hard,\" Toole said. \"He was there. He heard the gunshots and everything. You can't escape that when you're in a room and gunshots are flying – what do you do?\"\n\"We could really use the help to cover her funeral expenses,\" loved ones said on a GoFundMe page. \"She has two beautiful babies she is leaving behind. We just don't know how to do any of this alone. If you can find it in your heart to donate, our family will certainly appreciate all of your support.\"\nYaun's husband Mario Gonzalez told Spanish-language website MundoHispanico that they were getting massages in two separate rooms when the gunfire erupted. \nHe said he hid in the room, and when police came, he asked repeatedly if his wife was OK. He was detained and questioned with other witnesses and did not learn until later that his wife was one of the eight victims. \n\"What am I going to do?\" Gonzalez said. \"I have nothing.\" \n\nPaul Andre Michels\nPaul Michels, 54, owned an alarm company in Atlanta where he and his wife Bonnie lived for 26 years, his brother John said. Paul Michels had expressed interest in owning a spa and according to The Washington Post worked as a handyman at Young's Asian Spa.\nJohn Michels said his brother was \"just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in the USA where a series of shootings occurred at local spas, resulting in multiple fatalities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>PERSON<|>Hyun Jung Grant, 51, was a victim of the Atlanta shootings, known for her love of karaoke and dancing, and dedicated to raising her children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>PERSON<|>Xiaojie Tan, 49, was the owner of Young's Asian Spa and remembered as a hardworking and caring woman who provided for her family.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELAINA ASHLEY YAUN<|>PERSON<|>Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, was a victim of the shootings, leaving behind two young children and a husband who was present during the attack.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL ANDRE MICHELS<|>PERSON<|>Paul Andre Michels, 54, owned an alarm company and was a victim of the shootings, described as being in the wrong place at the wrong time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN SPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Young's Asian Spa is one of the locations where the shootings took place, owned by Xiaojie Tan.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a group that tracks incidents of hate, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans, which has seen a spike during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>ATLANTA<|>Hyun Jung Grant was a victim of the shootings that occurred in Atlanta, highlighting the violence in the city<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN SPA<|>Xiaojie Tan was the owner of Young's Asian Spa, where she was killed in the shootings<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DELAINA ASHLEY YAUN<|>ATLANTA<|>Delaina Ashley Yaun was a victim of the Atlanta shootings, which resulted in her tragic death<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL ANDRE MICHELS<|>ATLANTA<|>Paul Andre Michels was a victim of the shootings that took place in Atlanta<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ATLANTA<|>Stop AAPI Hate tracks incidents of violence against Asian Americans, including the shootings that occurred in Atlanta<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Xiaojie Tan's death is part of the incidents tracked by Stop AAPI Hate, reflecting the violence against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DELAINA ASHLEY YAUN<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Delaina Ashley Yaun's death is part of the incidents tracked by Stop AAPI Hate, reflecting the violence against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Hyun Jung Grant's death is part of the incidents tracked by Stop AAPI Hate, reflecting the violence against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL ANDRE MICHELS<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Paul Andre Michels' death is part of the incidents tracked by Stop AAPI Hate, reflecting the violence against Asian Americans<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
