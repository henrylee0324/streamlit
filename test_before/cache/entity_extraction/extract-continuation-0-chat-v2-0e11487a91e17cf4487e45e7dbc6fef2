They have been provided in English, simplified and traditional Chinese, Thai, Japanese and Korean. Just today, we added Vietnamese,\" said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, or A3PCON.\nThe Los Angeles-based community group and the San Francisco-based advocacy organization Chinese for Affirmative Action opened the reporting center on Thursday to allow Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to report incidents of hate, which have been surging as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads.\nHalf of the cases are from outside California, ranging from shunning to verbal harassment, according to Kulkarni.\n\"Some of the more shocking ones are where somebody is throwing a bottle at someone. It looks like just in the last few hours we've gotten a case where somebody in New York was punched by another individual, so actually physically beaten,\" she said.\nThe cases will be used for assistance, advocacy and education purposes, she said.\nSome US officials and lawmakers have repeatedly used the term \"Chinese virus\" or \"Wuhan virus\", even though the World Health Organization has a naming rule that prohibits linking a virus to a particular geographic location or group of people to avoid stigma.\nAs the terminology can falsely associate Asian Americans with the disease, Kulkarni said the labeling is putting people in harm's way.\nWhile trying to stay safe and healthy, as other US citizens are doing, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are facing increasing anxieties and fears whenever they leave their homes to go to the grocery store, the pharmacy or even just to get outside for a walk, she said.\n\"This is a time that we need to come together to help each other out,\" Kulkarni said.\nDavid Bernstein, president and CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, also opposed the use of what he called \"this unfortunate term\".\n\"It endangers Chinese and Asian Americans who are feeling the effects of rising bigotry,\" Bernstein said. \"We are organizing a Jewish and Asian American letter to the president and will issue it shortly.\n\"We worry both about the breakdown in international cooperation, at a time when we need it the most, and the impact it will have on vulnerable populations here in the US.\" On Monday, US President Donald Trump tweeted: \"It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. Kulkarni said she was glad to see the shift in the president's message, \"though we are concerned that significant damage was already done\".\n\"We hope this is not a temporary change, as some other more measured comments and corrections have been in the past,\" she said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>A3PCON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council (A3PCON) is a community group that opened a reporting center for Asian Americans to report incidents of hate related to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANJUSHA KULKARNI<|>PERSON<|>Manjusha Kulkarni is the executive director of A3PCON and has been vocal about the rise in racism and bigotry affecting the Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action is an advocacy organization that partnered with A3PCON to open the reporting center for hate incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles is the city where A3PCON is based and where the reporting center was opened.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is the city where Chinese for Affirmative Action is based and where the reporting center was opened.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in hate incidents against Asian Americans, prompting the establishment of the reporting center.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVID BERNSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>David Bernstein is the president and CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, who has spoken out against the use of terms that endanger Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the US President who tweeted about the importance of protecting the Asian American community during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANJUSHA KULKARNI<|>A3PCON<|>Manjusha Kulkarni is the executive director of A3PCON, leading efforts to address hate incidents against Asian Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>A3PCON<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action partnered with A3PCON to open the reporting center for hate incidents<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>A3PCON<|>A3PCON is based in Los Angeles, where the reporting center was established<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action is based in San Francisco, where it collaborates with A3PCON<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>A3PCON<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led A3PCON to establish a reporting center for incidents of hate<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVID BERNSTEIN<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>David Bernstein has spoken out against the hate incidents affecting the Asian American community, which Chinese for Affirmative Action addresses<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>MANJUSHA KULKARNI<|>Donald Trump tweeted about protecting the Asian American community, which Manjusha Kulkarni has been advocating for<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANJUSHA KULKARNI<|>DAVID BERNSTEIN<|>Both Manjusha Kulkarni and David Bernstein are advocating against the rise of bigotry affecting Asian Americans<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
