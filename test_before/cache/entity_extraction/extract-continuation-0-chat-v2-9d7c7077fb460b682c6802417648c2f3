It criticized the U.S. government for not actively adopting basic medical and anti-pandemic measures such as detection, tracking, and isolation, placing its hopes on \"magic bullets\" such as vaccines and new drugs, and hoping that the virus would eventually \"magically disappear\". On May 4, the famous U.S.political scientist Francis Fukuyama published the article The Wages of American Political Decay on the website The National Interest, pointing out that the highly polarized party politics made the political checks and balances an insurmountable obstacle to decision-making; that the pandemic, which should have been an opportunity to put aside differences and show unity, further deepened the political polarization. Politicians viewed the pandemic as an opportunity to seize power and partisan interests, and this came at the cost of the lives of countless American people.\nLeading to Catastrophic Consequences. The website of The New York Times reported on May 20, 2020, that research by Columbia University of the United States showed that delays in adopting movement restrictions had caused at least 36,000 people to die. According to the research, if the U.S. government had adopted movement restrictions one week earlier, it could have saved 36,000 lives, and if the U.S. government had adopted movement restrictions two weeks earlier, 83 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 could have been avoided. On May 24, The New York Times unprecedentedly dedicated its entire front page to 1,000 U.S. COVID-19 victims. Their names,\nages, and brief descriptions were listed under the headline \"U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss,\" with a subheadline reading: \"They Were Not Simply Names on a List. They Were Us.\" The website of the Time reported on May 20 that the delayed social-distancing measures caused 90 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the United States, and observed that such a huge loss of life was essentially a failure of U.S. democracy.\n2. Inequality within U.S. Society Being Fully Exposed during the Pandemic\nIn the United States, both liberal and conservative scholars agree on one basic fact that there is stark inequality within U.S. society. The deep-seated institutional reason for such inequality is that the U.S. government and political parties have long been manipulated by interest groups, and are unable to formulate and implement tax, industrial, and social security policies that promote social equality. During the pandemic, the social and economic inequality within U.S. society has been exposed and exacerbated.\nThe Elite Class of the United States Being Specially Treated in Coronavirus Testing. Viral infection does not distinguish between rich and poor, but the limited testing and medical resources were not fairly allocated in the United States. The website of The New York Times reported on March 19, 2020, that many dignitaries in the United States somehow underwent virus testing when they had no signs of infection and when nearly every state in the country lacked testing equipment. Uche Blackstock, an emergency medicine physician, said frustratedly, \"As a physician, I find it upsetting that celebrities and government officials without symptoms have been able to access testing quickly with same-day results, while I've had to ration out testing to my patients with turnaround times of five or seven days.\" This obvious injustice has made the public increasingly raise questions. When medical staff and many patients cannot be diagnosed, whether the privileged class obtains priority testing means that the ordinary people are deprived of testing opportunities. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an article on March 21 and commented that when the Titanic hit the iceberg and sank, women and children were protected and rescued first, but in the face of COVID-19, the United States has first rescued the rich and powerful groups. The gap between rich and poor in getting the virus tests in the United States has exposed the slackness, confusion, and injustice in its pandemic prevention and control system.\nPeople at the Bottom of U.S.Society Facing an Increasingly Dangerous Situation. The pandemic has made the lives of people at the bottom of U.S. society increasingly difficult, and further intensified the social polarization between rich and poor. According to a CBS report in 2019, nearly 40 percent of Americans would struggle to cover a $400 emergency expense, and 25 percent of Americans skipped necessary medical care because they could not afford the cost. The website of The Atlantic reported in April 2020 that low-income people in the United States would usually delay seeing a doctor when they became ill, not because they did not want to recover, but because they had no money at all. Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, tens of millions of people in the United States are not covered by medical insurance, when intensive care for COVID-19 costs as high as tens of thousands of dollars in the country. \"To be or not to be\" is not just a philosophical proposition of some literary work, but a realistic choice that the people at the bottom of U.S. society have to make. Russia Today reported on April 30 that a Gallup survey revealed that one in seven American adults said that if they or their family members developed symptoms related to COVID-19, they would probably give up medical treatment because they were worried that they could not afford the costs. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, pointed out on April 16 that the poor in the United States were \"being hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic\". He observed, \"Low-income and poor people face far higher risks from the coronavirus due to chronic neglect and discrimination, and a muddled, corporate-driven federal response has failed them.\"\nHigh Unemployment Rates Leading\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a national public health agency in the United States that aims to protect public health and safety through the control and prevention of disease, injury, and disability.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCIS FUKUYAMA<|>PERSON<|>Francis Fukuyama is a renowned U.S. political scientist known for his work on political order and decay, and he published an article discussing the impact of political polarization during the pandemic.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE NATIONAL INTEREST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Interest is a publication that features articles on foreign policy, national security, and political issues, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Columbia University is a prestigious Ivy League university in New York City known for its research and academic programs, including studies on public health and policy.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE NEW YORK TIMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York Times is a major American newspaper that provides news coverage and analysis on various topics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on society.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, leading to a global pandemic that has had significant health, economic, and social impacts.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHILIP ALSTON<|>PERSON<|>Philip Alston is a United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, known for his critiques of social inequality and its exacerbation during the COVID-19 pandemic.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CBS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CBS is a major American television network that provides news coverage and reports on various social issues, including economic challenges faced by Americans.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE ATLANTIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Atlantic is a magazine that covers cultural and political issues, including the social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on low-income individuals.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSIA TODAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Russia Today is a state-funded international television network that covers global news, including reports on the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on society.) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCIS FUKUYAMA<|>THE NATIONAL INTEREST<|>Francis Fukuyama published an article in The National Interest discussing the political implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.<|>8) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY<|>THE NEW YORK TIMES<|>Research by Columbia University reported on by The New York Times highlighted the impact of delayed movement restrictions on COVID-19 deaths in the U.S.<|>7) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>THE NEW YORK TIMES<|>The New York Times extensively covered the COVID-19 pandemic, including its death toll and societal impacts.<|>9) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHILIP ALSTON<|>COVID-19<|>Philip Alston commented on the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on low-income individuals in the U.S.<|>6) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CBS<|>COVID-19<|>CBS reported on the economic struggles faced by Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>5) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE ATLANTIC<|>COVID-19<|>The Atlantic published articles discussing the social inequalities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>6) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSIA TODAY<|>COVID-19<|>Russia Today reported on the social implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.<|>4) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
