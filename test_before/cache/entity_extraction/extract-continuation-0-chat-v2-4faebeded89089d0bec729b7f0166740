In\nthe past few weeks, we've seen horrifying reports of Asian Americans being harassed and punched, an elderly\nman thrown to the ground and killed in San Francisco, another slashed in the face and left to bleed inside a New\nYork City subway car, as well as countless videos of enraged people shouting at Asian Americans to go back to\ntheir countries and even spitting in their faces.\nThe recent turn of events is shocking but not surprising. For many Asian Americans, anti-Asian sentiments are\nborne in silence and isolation. I grew up mostly being embarrassed about my Korean heritage. In the U.S., we\nKoreans have to prove that we are American, even if we were born and raised here, by pushing ourselves to\nexcel at school and work. As children, some of us refused to learn to speak Korean. By doing so, we shed much\nof our ethnic identities.\nI was always acutely aware of how I should try to fit in. When I was 4 years old, we moved to Vancouver,\nCanada, where we lived in a predominantly white neighborhood. When I started elementary school in the late\n1970s, many people had never heard of Korea. Another Asian girl in my class by the name of Ming Ming would\nsit at the corner of one of the long lunch tables with her thermos of noodles. The other children would wince at\nthe smell. I did not fare better. Next to her, I would open up my doshirak, a Korean lunch box packed with fried rice, meat and vegetables and a pair of chopsticks that fit neatly inside. Mimicking the other children, I would\nscrunch up my nose at my own lunchbox and pretend that its contents were equally offensive to me.When I got home, I cornered my mother. Why couldn't she just pack me a normal lunch like peanut-butter-and-\njelly sandwiches?\"How is that even healthy?\" my mother countered. \"There are no vegetables in there!\" But my mother obliged,\nand to my relief, I was sent to school with a Western-styled sandwich.\nOne of my mother's favorite words in Korean is cham-ah, meaning to endure. It is what she and her family had\nto do when they escaped North Korea during the winter of 1950. Traveling on foot from Pyongyang to Seoul,\nthey crossed icy rivers and ran for cover from bombings and artillery fire before riding on the roof of a U.S.\nmilitary cargo train from Seoul to Daegu.\nMy parents arrived in Los Angeles in the 1970s and worked as janitors at the Shubert Theater, saving money to\nbuy their first grocery store in a Spanish-speaking neighborhood. Unable to secure a permanent visa for our\nfamily, we moved to Canada, where they cleaned fish at a local market and bought a hardware store. When my\nmom got her medical technologist certification, she found a job in New York and we moved back to the States.\nThrough all of their struggles to make ends meet, they instilled in us the concept of enduring. If someone\nmistreated us, we were told not to make a fuss. Cham-ah. When my schoolteacher told my parents that my\nKorean name was too difficult to pronounce, they consulted our church minister, who provided us with\nAmericanized names. Giving up our Korean names was a small price to pay to fit in. Cham-ah.\nEven today, I will rarely speak out when someone throws out a racial slur. I think to myself, is it really worth it?\nIt could be so much worse. Cham-ah.\nAll my life I felt like being Asian in America was a shortcoming I had to make up for by working hard and not\nsticking out too much. But recently, this low-grade anxiety has morphed into actual fear. Fear for my aging\nparents, relatives and their friends.\nI am hoping the coming herd immunity against the coronavirus might bring with it a new era of racial tolerance.\nThat vanquishing COVID-19 might also mean diminishing these racial attacks, particularly on our elders whom\nwe have been raised to respect and honor. But we can't wait for that to happen. It is time to speak up about\nanti-Asian hate crimes.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in the United States where the author's parents live on the outskirts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in the United States where an elderly Asian man was killed in a hate crime.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is a city in the United States where an Asian individual was attacked in a subway car.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANCOUVER<|>GEO<|>Vancouver is a city in Canada where the author lived during childhood.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOREA<|>GEO<|>Korea is the author's ancestral homeland, which they have a complex relationship with due to their heritage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles is a city in the United States where the author's parents arrived in the 1970s.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHUBERT THEATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Shubert Theater is a venue in Los Angeles where the author's parents worked as janitors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAEGU<|>GEO<|>Daegu is a city in South Korea where the author's family traveled to after escaping North Korea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH KOREA<|>GEO<|>North Korea is the country from which the author's family escaped during the Korean War.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a pandemic that has led to increased hate crimes against Asians in America.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOREAN HERITAGE<|>PERSON<|>The author's Korean heritage is a significant aspect of their identity and experiences in America.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHURCH MINISTER<|>PERSON<|>The church minister provided Americanized names to the author's family to help them fit in.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTHER<|>PERSON<|>The author's mother played a crucial role in their upbringing and instilled the concept of enduring.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FATHER<|>PERSON<|>The author's father, alongside their mother, worked hard to provide for the family and adapt to life in America.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOTHER<|>KOREAN HERITAGE<|>The author's mother influenced their understanding and relationship with their Korean heritage<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FATHER<|>MOTHER<|>The author's father and mother worked together to support their family and adapt to life in America<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>SHUBERT THEATER<|>The author's parents worked at the Shubert Theater after arriving in Los Angeles<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH KOREA<|>DAEGU<|>The author's family escaped from North Korea and traveled to Daegu during the Korean War<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANCOUVER<|>KOREA<|>The author lived in Vancouver, Canada, after moving from Korea, highlighting their immigrant experience<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>KOREAN HERITAGE<|>The pandemic has exacerbated issues related to the author's Korean heritage and experiences of racism<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>COVID-19<|>The hate crime in San Francisco is part of the broader context of increased racial violence during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>COVID-19<|>The attack in New York City is also linked to the rise in hate crimes against Asians during the pandemic<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
