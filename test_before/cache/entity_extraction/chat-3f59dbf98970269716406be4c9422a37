Can you tell us which laws they are?\nZhao Lijian: Isn't \"non-interference in other countries' internal affairs\" a basic norm governing international\nrelations? Do I have to elaborate?\nAssociated Press of Pakistan: According to reports, Chinese and Pakistani experts held a video conference on\nCOVID-19 yesterday. Could you give us more details?Zhao Lijian: Experts from China and Pakistan held a video conference on COVID-19 on July 8. The meeting was co-\nchaired by Yao Wen, Deputy Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, andDr. Aamer Ikram, Executive Director of Pakistan's National Institute of Health. Participants include Chinese\nAmbassador to Pakistan Yao Jing, experts of China's National Health Commission, representatives of Pakistan's\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and embassy in China, and public health experts from both countries. Chinese experts\nbriefed their Pakistani colleagues on China's prevention and control experience, practices in clinical diagnosis and\ntreatment and the progress in vaccine research and development. They also took questions raised by the Pakistani\nside.\nBoth sides spoke highly of the mutual support and close cooperation since the epidemic broke out. They believe this\nmeeting further enhances mutual understanding and agree to continuously strengthen technical exchange,\nexperience sharing and cooperation on vaccine R&D, jointly cope with the epidemics and uphold public health\nsecurity of the two countries and the world at large.\nAFP: Yesterday French foreign minister said that France was considering taking measures in response to China's\nimplementation of the law on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong. He didn't specify what these measures\ncould be, but several European countries could join the move. Do you have any comment on that?\nZhao Lijian: We noticed the reports. I'd like to stress that Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs that allow no\nforeign interference. We hope those countries can view the Law in a fair and objective manner, exercise prudence in\ntheir words and deeds, and do things that are conducive to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.\n(Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China)\nCopyright Thai News Service Group Jul 10, 2020\nChina News Service: According to reports, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized China's political system and\nepidemic response at a press conference on July 8. Do you have any comment?\nZhao Lijian: For quite some time Pompeo has been busy concocting fake news to vilify China and drive a wedge between\nChina and other countries. All this has laid bare his deep-seated Cold War mindset, zero-sum game mentality and\nideological prejudices.\nFacts can speak for themselves, while lies repeated a thousand times are still lies. We advise this US politician to rectify\nhis mistakes and stop spreading the political virus to avoid become a laughing stock.\nCCTV: A follow-up question. US Secretary of State Pompeo said in the same interview that \"Beijing claimed for months\nthat it reported the outbreak of the virus to the WHO. Now we know that's not true.\" He also said, the CPC \"has an\nenormous credibility problem\", that it \"chose to hide and obfuscate and deny basic truth\", and that it \"has to be held\naccountable.\" I wonder if you have any comment?\nZhao Lijian: The first thing I want to say is, Mr. Pompeo, stop talking about credibility, truth or accountability because we\nare so fed up with your words.\nSpeaking of credibility, while promoting \"America first\" in recent years, the US has been habitually breaching its\ninternational commitments and obligations and withdrawing from organizations and treaties. It is literally the biggest\n\"trouble maker\" in the world.\nSpeaking of the truth, I'd like to ask Mr. Pompeo: can US government tell people in America and around the world the truth behind the Fort Detrick biolab, the EVALI, and the US biolabs located all over the world?\nSpeaking of accountability, in less than six months, there have been over three million confirmed COVID-19 cases and\nmore than 130,000 death tolls in the US; the US government should indeed be held accountable for this.\nWith their own image and reputation hitting rock-bottom, I wonder why Mr. Pompeo and his like are so brazen to talk\nabout credibility, truth and accountability? We advise those US politicians heed the strong rejection from the international\ncommunity to the country's frequent pullback from various agreements and organizations.\nAfter the COVID-19 broke out, China notified the WHO at the earliest time possible, and the timelines published by both\nsides have listed all the facts that are mutually corroborated. Turning a blind eye to the internationally acknowledged\nfacts, Pompeo is so obsessed in fabricating lies and shifting the blame. His behaviors, instead of covering up the\nincompetence of the US side to fight the pandemic, only reveal his nature of lying and cheating and some American\nofficials' hypocrisy, arrogance and ignorance.\nReuters: First question, out of concerns over China's national security law for Hong Kong, the Australian Prime Minister\ntoday announced the decision to suspend the country's extradition agreement with Hong Kong and extend visas for Hong\nKong residents in Australia. Do you have any comment? Second, Global Times cited sources that China is considering\nsuing the German scholar Adrian Zenz and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Can you confirm this? Third question,\nin his speech on Sunday, Pope Francis didn't talk about his concerns over freedom and human rights\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
