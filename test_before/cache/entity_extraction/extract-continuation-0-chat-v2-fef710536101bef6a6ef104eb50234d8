During the recent Covid lockdowns the Chius have converted a portion of their\nguesthouse into a school and hired a tutor. Baby G is taught a broad curriculum that includes drawing, painting, global music, drumming, sound healing\nand yoga. In the afternoons they tend to the vegetable patch in order to teach him about sustainability or hang out with the llamas, borrowed from a rescue programme after Baby G was \"naturally drawn to\nthem\".\nDespite all this, Christine insists she is no \"tiger mom\". \"I don't think it was my parents' intention, but it was very much implied that I wasn't good enough,\" she says. \"My A was not good enough because I should\nhave gotten an A-plus. But I think it's the wrong type of push. My son should know he's good enough already.\"\nThe show's grotesque excesses aside, Christine believes Bling Empire will have a positive impact on perceptions of east Asians in America, and on notions of beauty. \"People are considering [us] beautiful, when all\nI wanted as a child was to be blonde and have blue eyes. It is very heartwarming.\" But she is aware acceptance is fragile and racism is rife. In the past year President Trump repeatedly called Covid-19 the\n\"Chinese virus\", which many believe was the reason for a sharp increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans.\nInitially Chiu thought the wave of discrimination wouldn't affect her, living in culturally diverse Los Angeles. But one Sunday morning this year at a farmers' market two white men started yelling at Baby G. \"My\nhusband and I had masks and sunglasses on ? it was questionable whether or not we were Asian ? but Baby G only had a mask on. They were calling\nhim the 'China virus' and telling him to go home and take this virus with him. I was shocked that there was still that much hatred. It woke me up because I thought we were insulated, being in LA, but we're not.\"\nI tell her about a text a friend of mine sent me about Bling Empire before our interview: \"I am OBSESSED!!!!\" She is Chinese-British and the show struck a chord with her. \"It's such an amazing portrayal of what\nit's like to be Asian (obviously not the financial side) but of the importance of family life,\" my friend wrote. \"I find it the most relatable programme I've ever watched, even though they are so different to me. It\nreally hit home with the things I've experienced. I know that for my mum, for example, the more westernised we got, the further we drifted from her. It's really hard.\"\nChiu understands. Since the death of her mother last year she has started to reconnect with long-lost family members back in Taiwan. \"I am reviving some cultural aspects of my background that were muted,\" she\nsays, but then stops herself. \"We are diving into questions that will be explored in season two, if there is one,\" she explains. \"I don't want to give away too many spoilers.\" A reminder, if ever one was needed, that\nher life is now a soap opera, and it's clear we have come to the end of my allotted episode n\nBling Empire is on Netflix now\nThe Prince of Wales \"is just a really remarkable man, and so funny too! Really witty ? he has the best sense of humour\" \"People are considering us beautiful, when all I wanted as a child was to be blonde and have\nblue eyes\"\nCAPTION: A pair of llamas join Christine Chiu and her son, Gabriel \"Baby G\", for a picnic at their home in Bel Air P o r t r A i t B y B r i n S o n + B A n kS; Top: Christine clashes with Anna Shay on the show.\nAbove: with her husband, Gabriel, the philanthropist Bruno Wang, left, and the Prince of Wales at Dumfries House, 2019; Top: Christine and Baby G strike a pose as Kevin Kreider, a friend, looks on.
