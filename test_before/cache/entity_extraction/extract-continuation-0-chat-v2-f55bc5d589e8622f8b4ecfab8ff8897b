The speciality tea store is located on a busy\ncommercial avenue in Washington's affluent Dupont Circle area, just steps away from some of the most popular\nbars and cafes, high-end hotels and multimillion-dollar town houses in the nation's capital, a city which prides\nitself on tolerance and diversity.\nYet, on a quiet morning last month, this was where a rising wave of xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment came\nfor 29-year-old Yunhan Zhang, who opened his store in February.\nThe store's closed circuit television captured what happened: a man, wearing red pants and a black jacket,\nenters the store yelling \"Covid-19!\" After being told to go away, the agitated assailant pulls out a can of pepper\nspray, using it on Zhang as he continues to hurl insults - which explicitly contained the term \"Chinese\" - before\nfleeing the scene.\nFor Zhang, an 11-year resident of the United States, the motive was clear. It marked the second time, he said,\nthat he had been targeted in an area otherwise known for its safety.\n\"This type of hate crime happened to us, again,\" he wrote on Twitter the day of the incident. \"It seems we're the\nonly business that keeps getting harassed and attacked in this neighbourhood.\"\nZhang is not alone. Across the country, organisations that track discrimination, harassment and violence against Asian-Americans have noted a steady rise in incidents throughout the four years of the Trump administration.\nIncidents were already on the rise as a result of US President Donald Trump's contentious relationship with\nChina and harsh immigration policies - but overt displays of discrimination spiked during the Covid-19pandemic. The Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Centre, a California-based group that monitors attacks on Asian-\nAmericans and Pacific Islanders, for example, reported more than 2,700 incidents between March and lateOctober alone - a figure the organisation believes is just the \"tip of the iceberg\".\nTo combat this wave of xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment, policy experts and community activists believe\nthat Joe Biden's incoming administration can take a number of steps, starting with a rapid reversal of Trump's\nimmigration policies.\nJohn Yang, the president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a Washington-based civil\nrights group, said that ending many of these policies would help \"change the narrative\" on Asian-Americans.\n\"Immediately, we'd expect the [incoming] president to take a number of measures by executive order, or\nrescind executive orders that have hurt immigrants,\" he said. \"This has a direct impact on the population, but\nalso sends a message that immigrants are welcome in the United States.\"\nOne step that Biden could take through executive order, Yang said, was dropping the \"public charge\" rule that\nallowed immigration officials to deny \"green cards\" - permanent residency - to immigrants who might need\npublic assistance, like food stamps. Opponents of the measure, first announced in 2018, have termed it a\n\"wealth test\" for immigrants.\n\"For the last four years, the narrative has been that immigrants are not welcome here, and that communities of\ncolour are somehow a threat,\" Yang added. \"That has to change, and that can change through executive\norders.\"\nOther steps could include facilitating H1-B visas, which allow US employers to temporarily employ foreign\nnationals in specialised occupations. In October, the Trump administration said it would impose salary\nrequirements - of US$150,000 to US$250,000 a year, depending on location and job title - on companies\nemploying these skilled overseas workers. At the time, the government said that the primary purpose of the\nchange was to \"reflect the actual wages earned by US workers similarly employed to foreign workers\".\nGovernment statistics show that most of the almost 600,000 H1-B visa holders in the US are from China and\nIndia. Earlier in the year, Trump signed an executive order suspending an array of worker visas - including H1-\nBs - before that decision was overturned by a federal judge. The announcement regarding the salary\nrequirements came the following week. Last week, a federal judge in California struck down the revised Trump\nadministration rules.\nDoing away with H1-B visa restrictions \"would send a strong signal that immigrants are welcome and that\nvilifying various groups isn't appropriate\", said Russell Jeung, the Stop AAPI Hate chair and an Asian American\nStudies professor at San Francisco State University.\n\"We recommend reversing immigration bans and stopping the suspension of visas for Chinese researchers and\nstudents, as well as rescinding the ban on racial sensitivity training\" at federal agencies, he added. \"In the first\n100 days, a lot can be done to signal that we're ending racist policies.\"\nMany of these steps were outlined by the Biden campaign in an agenda for Asian-Americans and Pacific\nIslanders released ahead of the November election. Biden vowed to provide a \"road map\" to citizenship for\nundocumented immigrants, including 1.7 million from Asia. He also promised to support family-based\nimmigration and increase the number of visas offered for permanent, work-based immigration.\nThe Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for the Asian-American community.\nPolicy experts believe that a change in tone from the president and other administration officials on relations\nwith China would have an important impact on how Asian-Americans are perceived in the US.\nJeung said that Stop AAPI Hate believes a \"more sane, diplomatic foreign policy\" - rather than a \"heated cold\nwar\" - will help ease feelings of animosity towards Chinese and Asian-Americans in communities across the\ncountry.\n\"We've seen how US-China relations have impacted domestic race relations,\" he said. \"You can be critical, but\n... a critique of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VALLEY BROOK TEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Valley Brook Tea is a specialty tea store located in Dupont Circle, Washington, known for its diverse clientele and community engagement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YUNHAN ZHANG<|>PERSON<|>Yunhan Zhang is the owner of Valley Brook Tea, who has been targeted in hate crimes due to rising xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUPONT CIRCLE<|>GEO<|>Dupont Circle is an affluent neighborhood in Washington, D.C., known for its commercial activity and cultural diversity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a California-based organization that monitors and reports incidents of discrimination and violence against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the incoming President of the United States, expected to reverse harmful immigration policies affecting Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States, whose administration's policies contributed to a rise in anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>H1-B VISA<|>EVENT<|>H1-B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations, which has been subject to restrictive policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>San Francisco State University is an educational institution where Russell Jeung, chair of Stop AAPI Hate, is a professor of Asian American Studies.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUNHAN ZHANG<|>VALLEY BROOK TEA<|>Yunhan Zhang is the owner of Valley Brook Tea, which was the site of a hate crime incident<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUPONT CIRCLE<|>VALLEY BROOK TEA<|>Valley Brook Tea is located in Dupont Circle, a neighborhood known for its commercial activity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>YUNHAN ZHANG<|>Stop AAPI Hate tracks incidents of discrimination, including those affecting Yunhan Zhang<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Joe Biden's administration is expected to take actions that align with the goals of Stop AAPI Hate to combat discrimination<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Donald Trump's policies have been linked to a rise in incidents that Stop AAPI Hate monitors<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>H1-B VISA<|>JOE BIDEN<|>Joe Biden is expected to facilitate H1-B visas, which have been restricted under Donald Trump's administration<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY<|>Russell Jeung is a professor at San Francisco State University and the chair of Stop AAPI Hate<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>YUNHAN ZHANG<|>Donald Trump's administration's policies contributed to the xenophobia that led to the hate crime against Yunhan Zhang<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
