Weixelman,40, could never have imagined that a life in the theater would involve enforcing public health protocols just devised by the state ofMassachusetts, Actors’ Equity, and the theater itself. But now he was concerned that performers at the front of the stage were at riskfrom those at the back, and he told Filderman that the partitions they had been using to separate singers next to one another mightalso be needed to separate the rowsThe cast was antsy. Filderman was frustrated. “I need to know,” growled the director, who was already deep into the first act, withbarely more than a week until the first performance. “We need this clarified.”Edwards, who is the elected liaison between the actors and their union, decided he was not going to wait for the creative team andtheater officials to brainstorm best practices. He pulled out his cellphone and called Equity’s national headquarters.The response was clear: Any time someone in the back row was singing, there would need to be a physical barrier between them andthose in the front row. And any time actors were passing within 6 feet of one another — meaning basically every time a scenechanged — they would need to wear a mask.Filderman’s original conceit, in which the actors entered the stage masked, performed the show while socially distant but withoutmasks, and then put on masks again when exiting into the offstage world, would not pass muster. “My concept for the show is gone,”he blurted out, “and life goes on.”The first several scenes, which had already been rehearsed, would now need to be “COVID-proofed” — a phrase that, interchangeablywith “Corona-proofed,” was quickly adopted by cast and crew. (Periodically, rehearsal would screech to a halt when someone yelled“COVID hold!” to raise a safety question.)There were complications for the designers, too.Hunter Kaczorowski, the costume designer, decided to tie-dye neck gaiters that could be used as face coverings during the show, easyto roll up and down without disrupting the head-mounted microphones.Adelson, the lighting designer, was in charge of limiting glare off the partitions. And Randall Parsons, the set designer, managed thepartitions themselves, rolling panels of clear vinyl that he called “spit guards.”“We’re not ecstatic about this, but we’re doing what we have to do for the prime directive, which is safety,” said Parsons, who, likemany of his colleagues, lost several jobs when the pandemic hit. “This is a new world for everyone. But I’m still like, ‘Oh my God, Ihave a show!’”Up the road, there were major complications for “Harry Clarke” as well. The play, starring Mark Dold and scheduled to open Aug. 9,was to be the first Equity-approved indoor production of the pandemic. And Barrington Stage went to great lengths to safeguard thetheater: upgrading its air conditioning system to improve air filtering and circulation, removing most of its seats to ensure socialdistancing and replacing bathroom fixtures (to make them touchless) and assistive listening devices (to make them easier to clean).But, just six days before the first performance, still lacking permission from Massachusetts to stage indoor theater, the productiondecided it had no option but to move outside.That night, much of the “Godspell” cast gathered on the porch of the large house where they were isolating — mystified by some ofthe restrictions (why could they sit on the stage floor where others had walked but not on chairs where others had sat?), frustratedwith all the changes (why didn’t they just do a concert performance?), worried that, at any point, the show could be shut down.Michael Wartella, an elder statesman among the group as a father and a 34-year-old with three Broadway credits, reminded theothers that chaos comes with theater. “There’s always stopped rehearsals with arguments and the director and choreographerscreaming at each other,” he said. “This is just a different topic.”Edwards, eating a burrito, cradling a script and eager to get back to running lines with his castmates, listened as the conversationdrifted from the legacy of AIDS to masking practices in Japan.“We’re risking our lives, but if this finishes and we don’t get sick, then whatever we’re doing is working,” he said. “Theater needs tobe saved somehow.”\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
