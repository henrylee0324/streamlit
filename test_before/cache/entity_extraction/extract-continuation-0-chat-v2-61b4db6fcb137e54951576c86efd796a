Chinese Americans throughout the United States are mobilizing to provide supplies and equipment to front-line medical professionals, even as the FBI warns of the likelihood of an increase in hate crimes targeting Asian Americans as the pandemic continues.\n\"The community itself, just in general, is organized,\" Mai Ngai, a professor of Asian American studies and history at Columbia University, told The New York Times recently. \"Chinese have all kinds of associations - some based on profession, and some based on the region your family comes from in China,\" she said. \"There's a history of networks, and a history of coming together when there's an issue.\"\nA graduate of China's Zhejiang University medical school, Lu emigrated from Shanghai to the United States in 1998. The stay-at-home mom represents many, if not most, of the Chinese Americans who have built lives in new places that have not always been welcoming.\n\"We cannot be completely separated from China,\" said Wei Wu, minister of the Chinese Christian Church of Germantown, Maryland, who co-founded CASH. \"Whatever happens in China reflects on us, even if this is our home.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020\nSince COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, late last year, it has swept through 209 countries, sickening 1.3 million people, and killing 75,000 as of Tuesday. There are more than 368,000 confirmed cases and 10,000 deaths in the United States.\nTwo California-based groups, Chinese for Affirmative Action and theAsian Pacific Planning and Policy Council, set up a hate crime reporting center in March and have recorded hundreds of incidents.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James also launched a hotline to cope with an increase in reports ofharassment and assaults, as well as the use of slurs against all Asian Americans during the coronavirus outbreak.\nWhich is why Ryan Lin bought not one gun but two.\n\"My wife has been against me having a gun, but this time, she made no objection,\" said Lin, a resident of the same leafy Maryland suburbs as Lu and Wei. Afraid for his family, Lin asked VOA not to use his real name.\nLu created CASH as a WeChat group on March 17, and within days some 400 people joined. WeChatis heavily censored by China's Communist Party and used regularly as a platform for itspropaganda. But for those with family and friends in China, it is the preferred social media platform for staying in touch.\nMany CASH members were part of an informal group started a week earlier byLiang Zhao, a native of Hebei province, who arrived in the U.S. in 1998.With a life science background, he and friends who are medical and pharmaceutical professionals anticipated a shortage of protective gear in the U.S. as they watched the epidemic take hold in China.\n\"We were worried about the health workers on the front lines, and we wanted to do something to show that we Chinese Americans care about our community,\" Zhao told VOA Mandarin. \"It's our own home.\"\nAs of March 31, the two groups, working with another grassroots Chinese American group, have raised about $100,000. Zhao said with that money, they reached out to medical suppliers approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in China and the United States.\nThe first shipment from China - 112,000 surgical masks, 3,000 N95 masks, more than 1,000 gowns and 360 face shields - was delivered to 12 local hospitals on Friday.\nYaya Zhang, a native of Jiangsu province who arrived in the U.S. in 2004, isa real estate agent and a CASH co-founder responsible for acquiring masks.
