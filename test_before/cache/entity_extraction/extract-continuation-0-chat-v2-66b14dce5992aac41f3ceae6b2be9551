Reports received\nindicate that racially motivated violence and other incidents against people of Asian descent have reached an alarming level in some countries,\" said E. Tendayi Achiume, the\nUnited Nations special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in a statement.\nDue to time zone differences, her statement was delivered by Kellie-Shandra Ognimba, from the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nAchiume said Asian-Americans have been subject to such attacks since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The attacks have ranged from physical assaults, vandalism and\nverbal harassment to denial of access to services and public spaces. Women have reported being harassed more than twice as often as men.\nThe situation is partly caused by irresponsible and discriminatory remarks by some public figures, she said.\n\"It's dismaying to witness state officials adopting alternative names for COVID-19 instead of using the internationally recognized name of the virus. These officials have adopted\nnames with geographic references, typically referring to its emergence in China. This sort of calculated use of a geographic-based name for this virus is rooted in and fosters\nracism and xenophobia,\" she said.\nNaming the virus with geographic references may not constitute as hate speech itself, but it will trigger hate speech, said Sun Shiyan, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of\nSocial Sciences' Institute of International Law.\nDuring the pandemic, COVID-19-related racist hate speech has been rampant in various countries, especially on social media. Such speech not only affects many ethnic groups\nbut also may threaten international solidarity in efforts to respond to the health crisis, Sun said.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese community in the Netherlands has moved from indirectly challenging racist comments to tackling them head on, especially during the outbreak. The\nassertiveness of the younger generation has been significant, said Tom Zwart, director of the Amsterdam university's Cross Cultural Human Rights Centre.\nOn Feb 6, a so-called corona song was broadcast by a radio station in the Netherlands. In the song, a number of crude remarks were made about Chinese people and Chinese\nrestaurants.\nAbout 60,000 people of Asian origin objected to the song by formally reporting it as a crime to the police. The public prosecutor then announced that it would investigate if the\nsinger and songwriter had committed the crime of offending a group of people on the basis of race.\nOn June 2, the prosecutor announced that it had decided not to pursue the case. The decision sparked outrage in the Chinese community, Zwart said.\nHe added that last week, community representatives opted to challenge the prosecutor's decision, further proof that it is ready to confront the issue in \"a very direct way\".\ncuijia@chinadaily.com.cn\nCredit: Cui Jia\nCopyright China Daily Jul 6, 2020\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to increased xenophobia and hate speech against certain ethnic groups, particularly those of East Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Human Rights Center of Central South University is an institution that focuses on human rights issues and hosted a seminar addressing racism during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Wuhan University Institute of International Law is an academic institution that contributed to the seminar on racism and xenophobia during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROSS CULTURAL HUMAN RIGHTS CENTRE AT VRIJE UNIVERSITY AMSTERDAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Cross Cultural Human Rights Centre at Vrije University Amsterdam is an organization that participated in the seminar discussing contemporary forms of racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E.
