He also said a third party told him of another incident in which someone verbally assaulted another individual.\nMyrick said these type of incidents will be investigated by the City of Ithaca if they are reported, but Ithaca Police Chief Dennis Nayor said not all of the previous incidents were reported.\nIn the City of Ithaca, 17.6% of the population identifies as Asian, according to 2017 U.S. Census data. Of the 5,406, 9% are Chinese. Much of the large Asian population is tied to the local colleges.\nThe coronavirus pandemic traces back to Wuhan, China, where it was discovered late last year. Its origin has led President Donald Trump to label the pathogen the \"Chinese virus\" and the disease the \"Wuhan flu,\" which has led to strong criticism because experts say this rhetoric empowers racism.\n\"I sent the message (Tuesday) because we have to nip it in the bud,\" said Myrick, who said harassment directed toward those of Asian descent increased from zero to at least three this week.\n\"(Wednesday), Trump tweeted 'Chinese coronavirus.' He's attempting to rebrand it by calling it the Chinese virus even though there's no reason to do so.\n\"He's trying to deflect blame. He thinks if we attach an ethnicity to the virus, (his response to COVID-19) will not change the election. This is an irresponsible, horrible form of politics that's never been seen before. Labeling an entire ethnicity with a disease has led to the biggest atrocities and genocides.\"\nMyrick shared a message on Facebook condemning the acts of prejudice and Trump's rhetoric.\nThe mayor has advised residents to share messages stating the Ithaca community will not tolerate hate. He suggested residents can do so with signs and on social media.\n\"Make your own message that racism and hate in this moment is the very last thing we need, and it won't be allowed or tolerated in the City of Ithaca,\" Myrick said in the video.\nTompkins County Legislator Chair Leslyn McBean-Clairborne shared similar sentiments at Tuesday's legislature meeting.\nClairborne said, \"Please be sensitive. Stop that behavior, and if you see it ... interrupt it and provide support to those being harassed.\"\nRacism toward Asian people has increased throughout the country recently, with metro areas such as Dallas-Fort Worth and Seattle reporting more incidents.\nIthaca police aware of harassment\nDuring the incidents in Ithaca, the individuals were followed, and comments about coronavirus and COVID-19 were directed toward them.\n\"This is not just occurring in different places around the country,\" Nayor said by phone. \"It is occurring locally as well. ... we won't tolerate that.\n\"These are challenging times for everyone, and we need to band together, not harass or discriminate anyone of any culture in regards to what is happening now.\"\nNaylor also sent an email to the city police department, telling his staff to \"be cognizant of any biased-based crimes which may occur as a result of what is going on internationally.\"\n\"As we are navigating the COVID-19, we may be likely to see more incidents like this perpetrated against members of our Asian community, so please be alert to that and let's do all we can to address any concerns that are brought forward,\" the email said.\nThe Tompkins County Sheriff's Office has not reported any complaints, but Sheriff Derek Osborne is aware of the recent incidents in the city.\n\"I think it's during times like these that we need to pull together as a community in support of one another rather than allow fear to drive a wedge between us,\" he said.\nHow some are discriminating against Asians\nRobert Ji-Song Ku, of the Department of Asian and Asian American Studies at Binghamton University, emphasized the harm that can come when ethnic groups are blamed irrationally or used as a scapegoat during the confusing and difficult times.\nJi-Song Ku said hostile behaviors toward these populations are increasing and include: Minor microaggressions.\nLeering looks.\nOutright racist behavior such as calling the virus \"Chinese virus\" or \"Wuhan virus.\"\nHe said the restaurant industry has experienced an overall downturn in business regardless of the type of food served, and it appears that Chinese restaurants suffered disproportionately.\n\"This is true for not only major Asian enclaves, such as Chinatowns in New York City and San Francisco, but also in areas with smaller Asian-American populations, such as the Southern Tier of New York,\" Ji-Song Ku said.\nMyrick expressed faith that residents will unite and stomp out hate.\n\"Yes, it will be more necessary,\" he said. \"It will be a confusing time. Entire professions will disappear. We will have to build a new social safety net and a new way to relate to each other.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ITHACA<|>GEO<|>Ithaca is a city in Tompkins County, New York, dealing with incidents of prejudice during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMPKINS COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Tompkins County is a county in New York where Ithaca is located, and it has reported cases of COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORNELL UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cornell University is a private Ivy League university in Ithaca that has expressed concerns about prejudice related to COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITHACA COLLEGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ithaca College is a private college in Ithaca where two members tested positive for COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DENNIS NAYOR<|>PERSON<|>Dennis Nayor is the police chief of Ithaca, addressing issues of harassment during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SVANTE MYRICK<|>PERSON<|>Svante Myrick is the mayor of Ithaca, advocating against discrimination and prejudice during the COVID-19 crisis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEREK OSBORNE<|>PERSON<|>Derek Osborne is the sheriff of Tompkins County, aware of recent incidents of harassment in Ithaca.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT JI-SONG KU<|>PERSON<|>Robert Ji-Song Ku is a professor at Binghamton University, discussing the impact of COVID-19 on Asian communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has led to increased prejudice and discrimination against Asian communities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DENNIS NAYOR<|>ITHACA<|>Dennis Nayor, as police chief, is responsible for addressing harassment incidents in Ithaca<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SVANTE MYRICK<|>ITHACA<|>Svante Myrick, as mayor, is advocating for unity and against discrimination in Ithaca<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEREK OSBORNE<|>TOMPKINS COUNTY<|>Derek Osborne, as sheriff, is aware of incidents in Tompkins County and is addressing community concerns<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT JI-SONG KU<|>CORNELL UNIVERSITY<|>Robert Ji-Song Ku is a professor discussing issues related to Asian communities, which are also relevant to Cornell University<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORNELL UNIVERSITY<|>ITHACA<|>Cornell University is located in Ithaca and is involved in community discussions about COVID-19 and prejudice<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITHACA COLLEGE<|>ITHACA<|>Ithaca College is located in Ithaca and has reported COVID-19 cases among its community<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>DENNIS NAYOR<|>Dennis Nayor is addressing the impact of COVID-19 on the community, including harassment incidents<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>SVANTE MYRICK<|>Svante Myrick is responding to the challenges posed by COVID-19, including rising prejudice<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>ROBERT JI-SONG KU<|>Robert Ji-Song Ku is analyzing the effects of COVID-19 on Asian communities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>DEREK OSBORNE<|>Derek Osborne is aware of the implications of COVID-19 on community safety and harassment<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
