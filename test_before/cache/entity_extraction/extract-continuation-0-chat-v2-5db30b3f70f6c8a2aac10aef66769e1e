One Texas city is trying to do something about it.\nThe San Antonio City Council unanimously passed a resolution on Thursday denouncing bigotry, anti-Semitism, crimes against Asian Americans and \"hateful speech\" amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe resolution, proposed by Mayor Ron Nirenberg, states that \"COVID-19 is a public health issue, not a racial, religious or ethnic one, and the deliberate use of terms such as 'Chinese virus' or 'Kung Fu virus' to describe COVID-19 only encourages hate crimes and incidents against Asians and further spreads misinformation at a time when communities should be working together to get through this crisis\".\nThe resolution also says that the Jewish community has been targeted with blame and conspiracy theories regarding the disease.\n\"The City of San Antonio denounces anti-Semitism, anti-Asian bigotry, and all hateful speech, violent action and the spread of misinformation related to COVID-19 that casts blame, promotes racism or discrimination or harms the City of San Antonio Asian and Pacific Islander, Jewish, immigrant or other communities,\" the resolution says.\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL, reports of xenophobic and racist incidents targeting members of the Asian-American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI, communities in the US have surged since January.\nThose incidents include Asian Americans being told to \"Go back to China\", being blamed for \"bringing the virus\" to the US, being referred to with racial slurs, spat on, and in some extreme cases, being physically assaulted.\nADL compiled a list of anti-AAPI incidents that have been reported by media outlets across the country since January. The number of incidents is close to 100.\nOne of the most recent reports showed that in New York, an Asian man was attacked on the subway by a stranger who shouted at him, \"You're infected, China boy. You need to get off the train.\" The assailant then grabbed the victim and attempted to pull him out of his seat.\nSome comments regarding the report of San Antonio's new anti-hate speech resolution at ksat.com have been negative, indicating that such bias and discrimination are prevalent.\n'Rather disheartening'\n\"It's rather disheartening to see such a large number of negative, angry, and downright crude comments that have appeared on local social media and news media websites since the passage of this resolution by the San Antonio City Council,\" said Jon Taylor, professor and department chair of the political science and geography department at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\"Calling people out for their hateful comments is a reminder that words can and do have meaning and consequences. Those opposed to this resolution don't see it quite that way and view it as an infringement of their free speech rights. And that's their right as Americans. But that doesn't mean that people can't be civil,\" Taylor said.\nSteven Pei, a professor at the University of Houston and honorary chair of United Chinese Americans, or UCA said: \"We appreciate very much that the San Antonio City Council declared war against hate speeches such as 'Chinese virus' and 'Kung Fu flu' to ensure safety of the entire community.\"\nHe pointed out that Asian Americans did not spread the virus; on the contrary, they have made great contributions to combat the virus by raising funds to donate personal protection equipment to medical workers, first responders and communities in need across the US.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAN ANTONIO CITY COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The San Antonio City Council is the governing body of San Antonio, Texas, which passed a resolution denouncing hate speech and bigotry amid the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RON NIRENBERG<|>PERSON<|>Ron Nirenberg is the Mayor of San Antonio who proposed the resolution against hate speech related to COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, leading to public health issues and increased hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is an organization that fights anti-Semitism and other forms of hate, which reported a surge in xenophobic incidents against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT SAN ANTONIO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Texas at San Antonio is an educational institution where Jon Taylor is a professor and department chair.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON TAYLOR<|>PERSON<|>Jon Taylor is a professor and department chair at the University of Texas at San Antonio, who commented on the resolution's impact on free speech.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Houston is an educational institution where Steven Pei is a professor and honorary chair of United Chinese Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEVEN PEI<|>PERSON<|>Steven Pei is a professor at the University of Houston and honorary chair of United Chinese Americans, who praised the San Antonio City Council's resolution.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED CHINESE AMERICANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>United Chinese Americans (UCA) is an organization that advocates for the rights and safety of Chinese Americans, represented by Steven Pei.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AAPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AAPI stands for Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, which have faced increased hate incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a city where a recent incident of hate against an Asian man occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON NIRENBERG<|>SAN ANTONIO CITY COUNCIL<|>Ron Nirenberg proposed the resolution that the San Antonio City Council passed to denounce hate speech<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN ANTONIO CITY COUNCIL<|>COVID-19<|>The San Antonio City Council's resolution addresses issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including hate speech<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE<|>AAPI<|>The ADL reported a surge in hate incidents targeting the AAPI communities during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON TAYLOR<|>SAN ANTONIO CITY COUNCIL<|>Jon Taylor commented on the resolution passed by the San Antonio City Council and its implications for free speech<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVEN PEI<|>SAN ANTONIO CITY COUNCIL<|>Steven Pei praised the San Antonio City Council's resolution against hate speech<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVEN PEI<|>UNITED CHINESE AMERICANS<|>Steven Pei is the honorary chair of United Chinese Americans, advocating for the safety of the community<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>AAPI<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased hate incidents against the AAPI communities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK<|>COVID-19<|>An incident of hate against an Asian man occurred in New York during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
