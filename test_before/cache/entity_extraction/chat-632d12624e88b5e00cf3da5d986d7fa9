The house had Chinese writing along the front door as a blessing for good health and harmony.\nThese are first-hand accounts where individuals are describing harrowing and traumatizing experiences, including what is being said to them when they're being attacked, said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, one of the coalition partners.\nAsian Americans have been targeted before during public health crises, as was the case during the 2003 SARS epidemic. The latest wave of anti-Asian hate comes at a time of heightened tensions over the pandemic fueled by the anti-China rhetoric of President Donald Trump and other politicians. Trump, who initially praised China for its handling of the crisis, subsequently blamed China's leader Xi Jinping for waiting weeks to report the outbreak in Wuhan to the World Health Organization and covering up the severity of the problem.\nTrump has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the Chinese virus and kung-flu, terms that Asian American advocates say are derogatory and have exacerbated the scapegoating of Americans of Asian descent.\nTrump disputes that those and other terms are racist. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who several weeks ago criticized the phrase kung-flu as highly offensive, and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany both said this week that the president used the term merely to highlight that the virus originated in China.\nBut Asian American leaders say the meaning is not lost on their fast-growing community.\nThose are terms meant to be humiliating, said Gene Wu, a Chinese American Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives.\nBill Ting, a Democratic state assemblyman in California, said the rhetoric has had a direct impact on the surge in anti-Asian harassment and hate crimes.\nYou see leaders express words that really give license to other people to express those same sentiments and also to act on them, Tung said.\nIn a recent report examining the link between political rhetoric and anti-Asian bias, STOP AAPI Hate, the Asian American coalition, found that reports of anti-Asian discrimination spiked after Trump repeatedly used the term Chinese virus.\nWhile the vast majority of the 2,100-plus incidents recorded by STOP AAPI Hate do not rise to the level of a hate crime as defined by statute, more than 100 do, according to legal experts.\nThe FBI reports there has been an uptick in hate crimes and harassment against Asian Americans since the outbreak of COVID-19, which first appeared in Wuhan, China, late last year\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
