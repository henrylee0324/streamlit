Thiessen, 55, of Fond du Lac is a hate crime becauseThiessen was targeted because of his race — Thiessen was white and defendant Daniel Navarro, a Mexican-\nAmerican, told police he intended to kill a white person.Statements Navarro is accused of making to police immediately after the crash — unless his attorney can get a\njudge to throw them out — would likely eliminate several potential defenses.\n\"Navarro stated he intentionally crashed into the motorcycle, head-on,\" District Attorney Eric Toney said in a\ncriminal complaint. Fond du Lac County Sheriff's Sgt. Logan Will, who spoke with Navarro minutes after the July\n3 crash, said Navarro told him, \"It was intentional, sir.\"\nNavarro's truck left no skid marks or other signs he tried to avoid Thiessen before a head-on collision on\nWinnebago Drive in Taycheedah, the complaint says. There is no evidence the two knew each other before the\ncrash.\nProsecutors also say Navarro said white people had been harassing him, \"giving him acid\" and contaminated\nhim with a chemical sterilizer.\nNavarro, 27, is charged with first-degree intentional homicide with a deadly weapon as a hate crime, and first-\ndegree recklessly endangering safety with a dangerous weapon, as a hate crime. He is in Fond du Lac CountyJail in lieu of $1 million bond.\nNavarro is due in county circuit court on Wednesday for arraignment.\nThe law since 1988\nHate-crimes — crimes motivated by bigotry — became illegal under a measure the state Legislature adopted in\n1988.\nThen Rep. David Clarenbach, D-Madison, authored the bill after incidents including cross burnings, the painting\nof a swastika on a synagogue and the killing of a white woman walking in a mall parking lot with a Black man,\naccording to a 1988 report in the Janesville Gazette.\n\"If a man is assaulted because he is Black,\" Clarenbach said, \"the penalty for assault should be enhanced to\nreflect the intimidation connected with the crime.\"\nHate crimes \"enhancers,\" as they are known, allow increased fines and prison time for crimes that target people\nbecause of race and ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability or gender. A judge can add up to $5,000,\nand/or an additional five years in prison to the sentence of someone convicted of a hate-crime felony.\nRace and ethnicity remain the most common reasons for hate crimes in the state, and in the nation, statistics\nshow.\nNationally, the FBI says, Blacks were the targets of 1,943 hate crimes in 2018 — more than any other race,\nfigures show. Next are whites, at 762, and Latinos, at 485.\nPerhaps the state's best-known hate crime is the August 2012 mass shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in\nOak Creek, near Milwaukee. A white supremacist killed six people, including four priests, and wounded four\nothers before killing himself after being shot by an Oak Creek police officer.\nAnother victim, paralyzed in the attack, died earlier this year.\nToday, though, Wisconsin's hate-crime cases remain fairly rare, U.S. Justice Department figures show.\nSince 2014, when 51 were reported, the numbers declined for two years, then nudged back up to 46 in 2017,\nand rose again to 53 in 2018, the most recent year for which figures were available.\nHate crimes, insanity defense\nWhen he spoke to deputies at the crash scene, and detectives later that night, Navarro told sheriff's officials he\nhadn't nodded off at the wheel. Nor did he claim Thiessen was riding in a way that would have caused Navarro\nto think he needed to defend himself against the motorcyclist, based on what witnesses told police.\nThat limits his options in terms of a criminal defense, meaning his best defense might involve employing an\n\"insanity defense\" — making the case about his mental condition.\nThat approach — pleading not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, commonly labeled an \"insanity\ndefense\" or \"NGI\" — is available, but rarely used. Black's Law Dictionary says it's employed in less than 1% of\nWisconsin criminal cases.\nDefense Attorney Jeffrey Jensen wasn't available for comment but had indicated after a brief court proceeding in\nJuly that he might consider a defense based on Navarro's mental health.\nIn an insanity defense, the defendant must admit he or she committed the crime. A defense attorney must then convince the court that his client couldn't understand his actions were wrong, and couldn't stop himself from\ncommitting the crime.\nThe defense could also convince a court the defendant knew his actions were wrong but couldn't \"conform his\nconduct to the law\" — something Marquette University Law Professor Michael O'Hear called \"the irresistible\nimpulse.\"\nAt trial, both sides will call expert witnesses who've examined the defendant. The defense's expert will likely\ntestify that the defendant should be found not guilty because of his mental condition and the prosecution's\nwill disagree.\nEven then, a successful insanity defense won't necessarily keep a defendant from being locked up for a long\ntime. Defendants who are found guilty, but not responsible, are typically confined to a psychiatric institution,\nnot released into the community or sent to prison. And in Wisconsin cases where a jury accepts an insanity\ndefense, a judge can reject that finding.\nKenneth Freeman of Milwaukee was\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PHILLIP A.
