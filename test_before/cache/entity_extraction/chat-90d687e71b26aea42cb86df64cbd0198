Larry Hogan (R) told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday morning that anti-Asian harassment during\nthe coronavirus pandemic has been \"a serious problem\" for his wife, Yumi, an immigrant from South Korea, and\nher three adult daughters.\n\"They have felt some discrimination personally,\" he said on Tapper's State of the Union talk show, describing\nexperiences within his own family and among their close friends, whom he said have \"been treated pretty\nterribly.\"\n\"We feel it personally with my daughter, who sort of is sometimes afraid to come visit us,\" Hogan said, \"with\npeople who had best friends that were being harassed at the grocery store, or being called names, and people\nyelling about the 'China virus,' even though they're from Korea and born in America.\"\nIn 2020, reports of hate crimes were down 7 percent nationally but increased 150 percent against people in the\nAsian community, according to a study released this month by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism\nat California State University at San Bernardino, which examined police records in 16 of the country's largest cities.\nHogan cited the statistic in the CNN interview, calling it \"outrageous\" and \"unacceptable.\"\nFormer president Donald Trump often used the term \"China virus\" when referring to the coronavirus, which\nexperts say may have helped stoke anti-Asian sentiment during the pandemic.\nOn Sunday, Hogan thanked President Biden for condemning anti-Asian discrimination in his first prime-time\naddress Thursday.\n\"It's something we have to get under control,\" the governor said. \"And I wish more people would be speaking\nout. And I appreciate the president's remarks.\"\nHogan had expressed similar sentiments on Twitter, posting a photo of himself, the first lady, their children and\ngrandchildren.\nHogan first met his wife at an art show more than 20 years ago. They married in 2004, with Hogan wearing\ntraditional Korean garb at the ceremony. Yumi Hogan brought three daughters from her previous marriage. The\nblended family is close, and the governor's stepdaughters call him \"Dad.\"\nAs first lady, Yumi has focused on the arts; she is an abstract landscape painter and art professor. At the time of\nHogan's first inauguration in 2015, she was believed to be the nation's first Korean American first lady.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
