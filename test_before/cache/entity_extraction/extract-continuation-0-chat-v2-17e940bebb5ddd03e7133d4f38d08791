She and others have called for Rodriguez to resign.\nFang returned to Manhattan a couple of years ago after studying at New York University. This is where her parents chose to make a home in 1997 when they immigrated from a rural area of China. Before opening the grocery store, the family owned a restaurant in town.\n“There was one day I picked up the phone and someone asked me if my family cooked cats and dogs,“ Fang said. ”This was when I was 10. And now at the age of 24, I’ve got a local politician saying these things about Chinese people and COVID-19. So even 14 years later, it’s still happening in this community. And it always will.\n“The difference now is I’m not 10 — I’m 24, and I now have the ability to say something. I’m not scared anymore. I have a very strong support system. I’m in this. I know it’s going to be a fight, but if I’m going to go into a fight with anybody, I’m so glad to do it with Manhattan, Kansas.”\nFang said her anxiety skyrocketed when she heard COVID-19 broke out in China, fearing racist reaction in the United States. She has been asked in her store, sometimes by children, if she has the virus. And she watched the terrifying video of an attack on an Asian American woman in New York City, who suffered chemical burns when a man poured liquid on her as she took out the trash.\nThat anxiety was heightened by Rodriguez’s remarks during a commission meeting last month, as reported by the Manhattan Mercury.\n“I know that other people are having a great problem,” he said. “And someone reminded me that in Italy, they have a lot of garment-people there, fashionists, and they have a tremendous amount of Chinese there, and that’s where a lot of it started. So we don’t necessarily have any (Chinese people), but I think the board would like to make sure that we’re on top of it.”\nFang’s immediate response: “Excuse my language for this, but it felt like a big f*** you.”\n“I just can’t say it any other way,” she said. “It made me question why I even came back to this community.”\nWhen Fang confronted Rodriguez at a subsequent meeting, he “apologized for the remarks and how they may have hurt people.”\n“That’s not how I think,“ he said. ”I have everybody on my mind ... and I’ve got a lot of Chinese food here, and I’ve got some Chinese friends and stuff.”\nRodriguez didn’t return a phone call seeking comment for this story.\nAs a county commissioner, Rodriguez also serves on the county’s board of health. Shana Bender, an organizer for the Manhattan Alliance for Peace and Justice, questioned the effect his “plainly racist” remarks would have on the rest of the department.\n“How are they going to respond in a global crisis?“ Bender said. “What does that mean for our minorities who come for emergency services? Will there be a bias in place? Will this put people at further harm because of their internal bias?”\n  Dennis Butler, director of the Riley County Police Department, welcomed feedback from Asian Americans who feel unsafe or wish to report bias or a hate crime.\n“Violence, threats of violence, bias and hate crimes directed toward Asian Americans is as unacceptable as it is against any persons who are targeted because of what they look like or where they come from,” Butler said. “Any bias-based crimes reported to the Riley County Police Department will be vigorously investigated.”\nKansas Rep. Rui Xu, a Democrat from Westwood, said words have an effect on Asian Americans living in the United States.\n“I keep making the point that nobody’s confused about where this virus is from,“ Xu said. ”Nobody’s confused that China probably hid this for at least a couple of weeks, or at least hid the numbers. Nobody is on the other side of that issue. But for Asian Americans, this is actually dangerous for us here. I know what you’re trying to do. I get it. But it’s actually harming people here, so you’ve got to stop.”\nHealth officials in Kansas have documented 50 deaths and 1,268 infections from the coronavirus, which first was detected in the state in early March. So far, 20 Riley County residents have tested positive for COVID-19.\nGov. Laura Kelly has issued a series of high-profile executive orders, including a statewide mandate to stay at home except for essential needs, as part of her administration’s response to the pandemic.\n“I abhor any acts of aggression, particularly when they are motivated by race, gender, sexual orientation, whatever, so I would ask Kansans to please not do that,“ Kelly said. ”This is no one person’s fault, no one ethnic group’s fault. This is a pandemic that we all have responsibility to make sure it goes away, and we need to do our part.”\nSometimes, Fang wonders if it would be safer to close the market and recede into the shadows.\nFor her, that isn’t an option\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FANNY FANG<|>PERSON<|>Fanny Fang is a resident of Manhattan, Kansas, who owns and operates the Asian Market grocery store and has been outspoken against racism towards Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARVIN RODRIGUEZ<|>PERSON<|>Marvin Rodriguez is a Riley County commissioner who made racist remarks regarding COVID-19 and the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANHATTAN<|>GEO<|>Manhattan is a city in Kansas where Fanny Fang lives and operates her grocery store.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RILEY COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Riley County is the county in Kansas where the events involving Fanny Fang and Marvin Rodriguez took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>New York University is where Fanny Fang studied before returning to Manhattan, Kansas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN MARKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asian Market is a grocery store owned by Fanny Fang's family in Manhattan, Kansas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KANSAS<|>GEO<|>Kansas is the U.S. state where the events described in the text are occurring.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNOR LAURA KELLY<|>PERSON<|>Laura Kelly is the Governor of Kansas who issued executive orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUI XU<|>PERSON<|>Rui Xu is a Kansas Representative who commented on the impact of racist remarks on Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANHATTAN ALLIANCE FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Manhattan Alliance for Peace and Justice is an organization represented by Shana Bender, who questioned the implications of Rodriguez's remarks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RILEY COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Riley County Police Department is responsible for investigating bias and hate crimes in the community.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FANNY FANG<|>MARVIN RODRIGUEZ<|>Fanny Fang confronted Marvin Rodriguez about his racist remarks regarding the Asian community and COVID-19<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FANNY FANG<|>ASIAN MARKET<|>Fanny Fang owns and operates the Asian Market grocery store in Manhattan, Kansas<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARVIN RODRIGUEZ<|>RILEY COUNTY<|>Marvin Rodriguez is a commissioner in Riley County, where he made his remarks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FANNY FANG<|>MANHATTAN<|>Fanny Fang lives and operates her business in Manhattan, Kansas<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FANNY FANG<|>NEW YORK UNIVERSITY<|>Fanny Fang studied at New York University before returning to Manhattan<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOVERNOR LAURA KELLY<|>KANSAS<|>Laura Kelly is the Governor of Kansas and has issued executive orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUI XU<|>KANSAS<|>Rui Xu is a Kansas Representative who commented on the impact of racism on Asian Americans in Kansas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHANA BENDER<|>MANHATTAN ALLIANCE FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE<|>Shana Bender is an organizer for the Manhattan Alliance for Peace and Justice<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DENNIS BUTLER<|>RILEY COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>Dennis Butler is the director of the Riley County Police Department, which investigates bias and hate crimes<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
