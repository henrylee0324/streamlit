The second and third waves were tied to European colonisation of the Pacific, with\npeople coming to Aotearoa as trainee teachers, missionaries, sailors, whalers and civil servants.\nThe fourth wave was linked to migration for economic reasons, with Pacific peoples finding work in the\nmanufacturing and service sectors after World War II.\nAfrican Americans arrived in colonial times, but most of the arrivals from Britain's African colonies in the\n1870s were white. In the 1960s, black students came to New Zealand through study programmes.\nImmigration rules meant very few black people arrived before the 1990s. In 1991, the government\nincreased the number of refugees, which saw people from Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, Zimbabwe and\nother countries move to New Zealand.\nIn the late 1800s, people from Lebanon migrated to Dunedin, Wellington and Auckland. Other Middle\nEastern groups that moved to New Zealand were Assyrian Christians and refugees from Iraq and Iran\nwho arrived in the 1990s.\nPeople from Israel, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Bahrain\nmoved to New Zealand in the 2000s.\nPeople of Indian origin have been coming to New Zealand since the late 18th century, often on British\nEast India Company ships. In the 1890s, Indian migration increased. Pakeha at the time lumped them\nwith \"Assyrian hawkers\", and there were attempts to create laws against hawker activities and to limit\ntheir immigration.\n'There's always a bias'\nWaitakere Indian Association president Sunil Kaushal says \"irrespective of whether you're a first or\nsecond generation, there's always a bias\".\n\"Indians came to New Zealand in the late 18th century and made New Zealand their home, but on the\nflip side of it, someone who comes from Europe or America are just seen as Europeans, which is just\n'normal Pakeha'.\"\nPeople did not ask those of European descent where they came from, he says, which led to an\nunderlying feeling that Indians were not considered Kiwis.\nIn 2020, the association commissioned a report to understand the economic significance of people of\nIndian ethnicity in New Zealand. It found that 240,000 people of Indian descent contributed $10 billion\nto the economy in 2019.\nThat number is astounding, and shows how much people of Indian origin contribute to New Zealand, but\nthey are still being put in a box and stigmatised, says Kaushal.\n\"Is it a myth or is it a reality? I think it's a reality, rather than a myth.\n\"We are Kiwis. We have given up everything to come here to be in the land of the long white cloud.\nThis is our home.\"\n'I feel it in myself'\nVeena Patel has Fijian Indian and Pakeha roots. Her family moved from Fiji to New Zealand when she\nwas 4, after a succession of political coups in the 1980s.\nWhen it comes to her cultural background, she says it can feel difficult to fit in or feel a part of either\nof them.\nIt's not one moment or experience that has made her feel that way, but it's something that strikes\nher daily.\n\"When I say my name, people don't recognise me as having my name,\" she says.\"It used to make me\nfeel like I didn't fit in anywhere and I wanted to minimise or hide my difference to fit in with everyone\nelse and not be seen to be different in any way.\n\"As I get older and grow more mature, I've been able to negotiate that for myself. My identity has\nbeen a journey for me, and one of discovery, and I've been lucky enough to have my parents to\nexplore both sides of myself.\"\nPatel says identity goes beyond things such as ethnicity, nationality, gender and where you live.\n\"Your identity and who you see yourself as, especially for culture, that's something you get to define\nfor yourself. Once you see that and understand that, it's really liberating . . . It doesn't matter\nwhether people recognise me as Indian any more, because I feel it in myself.\"\nShe feels excited for New Zealand to enter a \"new era of maturity in terms of how we think about our\ndiversity - how we think about integration as a two-way thing\".\nHaving a diverse background should be a source of pride, she says. It's not something that has a\nbearing on whether people are Kiwi or not, because it is OK to identify with more than one culture.\nCAPTION:\nMick and Setsuko Donnelly on their wedding day in August 1956 and, right, on holiday in Yotsugi,\nJapan, in 1955.
