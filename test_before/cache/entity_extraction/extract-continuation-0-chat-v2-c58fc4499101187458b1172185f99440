Staffed by 25 detectives of Asian descent who\nspeak a combined nine Asian languages, the group is tasked with guiding victims through the justice system, from reporting a crime all the way to prosecution. It\nwill remain after the pandemic, the NYPD said.\n\"When a victim looks at an Asian cop, they'll see, 'Oh he reminds me of my brother, or my son,'\" said Stewart Loo, the NYPD deputy inspector who heads the task\nforce. \"It gives them some comfort level.\"\nThe nation's largest police department logged 23 incidents of coronavirus hate crimes, a separate category created this year to track crimes targeting someone for\ntheir identity based on the perception that it has something to do with Covid-19. All but one targeted New Yorkers of Asian descent.\nHate crimes overall have plunged in the city, according to NYPD data. There were 206 hate crimes recorded by the NYPD between Jan. 1 and Sept. 27, down 33%\ncompared with 308 in the same period a year ago. Incidents of anti-Semitism, which account for the majority of hate crimes reported in the city, fell 50%.\nDeputy Inspector Mark Molinari, commanding officer of NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force, said he wasn't surprised when crimes rose against Asian people. The origins\nof the virus in China, he said, would inspire some people to irrationally blame Asian-Americans.\nBut what he hadn't foreseen was the reluctance of some victims to cooperate with authorities—some driven by fear of law enforcement, others by a lack of English\nproficiency, and still more who worried about their troubles going public, he said.\n\"They would not answer our phone call, they would not answer the door for us,\" Mr. Molinari said.\nWhen he discussed these problems during a virtual town hall with the public, Mr. Loo, a commanding officer at the Manhattan South Detective Bureau, reached out\nwith a proposal: create a team of Asian-American officers to investigate crimes that involve Asian victims or witnesses.\nSo far, officers on the task force have been sent out to chat with Asian victims in person, and have successfully convinced some to report crimes, Mr. Loo said. The\nofficers are loaned to the task force as needed, but also have full-time jobs elsewhere in the department.\nMr. Loo, who immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a child in 1983, said his father was robbed multiple times working as a delivery man for Chinese restaurants in\nManhattan during the 1980s. He would serve as a translator between his dad and the police, he said.\n\"I was kind of like 8 or 9 years old, trying to translate, trying to get through,\" he said. \"It was tough.\"\nThose experiences partly inspired him to join the NYPD in 2000, he said.\n\"With Covid and the whole anti-Asian sentiment, it's a very uncomfortable feeling being out in public,\" he said.\nCoronavirus-related hate crimes have occurred in neighborhoods in all five boroughs of the city except Staten Island, NYPD data showed. Manhattan has\nexperienced the most, with 13 incidents, followed by five in Brooklyn, three in Queens and two in the Bronx. Arrests have been made in 15 cases.\nIn one March incident, the police said, a group of four teenage girls approached a 51-year-old woman on an MTA bus in the Bronx. The teens attacked the woman,\nmade anti-Asian statements and struck her in her head with an umbrella before fleeing the bus. The woman was taken to a local hospital where she received stitches for a laceration to her head.\nThe new task force is staffed by 25 detectives of Asian descent who speak a combined nine Asian languages. PHOTO: José A. Alvarado Jr. for The Wall Street Journal\nThree 15-year-old girls, who were apprehended near the scene a short time after the incident, were arrested and charged with hate-crime assaults, menacing and\nharassment. One teen wasn't apprehended.\nIn another case in September, a man on a bicycle began yelling anti-Asian statements at a man and his female companion who were walking on Broadway in\nManhattan near Union Square. The man on the bicycle then assaulted the man with his bicycle and his backpack, before fleeing on the bicycle. Nobody was injured,\nand no arrests were made.\nAlice Wong, chief of staff at the Chinese-American Planning Council in New York City, said many of her friends and family started fearing for their safety after the\npandemic hit. Some people blamed Asians for the virus, or would avoid Asian people or businesses out of a misguided fear that they would get Covid-19, she said.\nMs. Wong, who hasn't been the victim of a crime, said she has talked to the NYPD since March to voice her concern about anti-Asian sentiment and crimes and\nshare concerns she hears from others in the community.\n\"Everyone thought it was a matter of time before someone said something derogatory or someone hurt them or someone said they should go back to their country,\"\nshe said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York Police Department (NYPD) is the largest police department in the United States, responsible for law enforcement in New York City, and is forming an Asian Hate Crime Task Force to address crimes targeting Asian individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian Hate Crime Task Force is a newly formed unit within the NYPD dedicated to investigating hate crimes against Asian individuals, staffed by detectives of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEWART LOO<|>PERSON<|>Stewart Loo is the deputy inspector of the NYPD and heads the Asian Hate Crime Task Force, advocating for the comfort of victims through representation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARK MOLINARI<|>PERSON<|>Mark Molinari is the commanding officer of the NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force, who has observed the rise in hate crimes against Asian individuals during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has led to increased hate crimes against Asian individuals, as some people irrationally blame them for the virus's origins.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANHATTAN<|>GEO<|>Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New York City, which has experienced the highest number of coronavirus-related hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROOKLYN<|>GEO<|>Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York City, which has recorded incidents of coronavirus-related hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUEENS<|>GEO<|>Queens is one of the five boroughs of New York City, which has also seen incidents of coronavirus-related hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRONX<|>GEO<|>The Bronx is one of the five boroughs of New York City, where incidents of coronavirus-related hate crimes have occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATEN ISLAND<|>GEO<|>Staten Island is one of the five boroughs of New York City, which has not recorded any coronavirus-related hate crimes according to NYPD data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE-AMERICAN PLANNING COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese-American Planning Council is an organization in New York City that addresses the needs of the Chinese-American community and has been involved in discussions about anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALICE WONG<|>PERSON<|>Alice Wong is the chief of staff at the Chinese-American Planning Council in New York City, who has voiced concerns about anti-Asian sentiment and crimes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>The NYPD is forming the Asian Hate Crime Task Force to specifically address hate crimes against Asian individuals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEWART LOO<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>Stewart Loo heads the Asian Hate Crime Task Force and is responsible for its operations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARK MOLINARI<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>Mark Molinari is a commanding officer within the NYPD, overseeing the Hate Crime Task Force<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>The rise in hate crimes against Asian individuals is linked to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANHATTAN<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>Manhattan has experienced the most incidents of coronavirus-related hate crimes, which the task force is addressing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROOKLYN<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>Brooklyn has recorded incidents of hate crimes that the task force is tasked with investigating<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEENS<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>Queens has seen incidents of hate crimes that the task force is addressing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRONX<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>The Bronx has reported incidents of hate crimes that the task force is investigating<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STATEN ISLAND<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>Staten Island has not recorded any hate crimes, indicating a contrast to the task force's focus areas<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE-AMERICAN PLANNING COUNCIL<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>The Chinese-American Planning Council has been in communication with the NYPD regarding anti-Asian sentiment and crimes<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALICE WONG<|>CHINESE-AMERICAN PLANNING COUNCIL<|>Alice Wong is the chief of staff at the Chinese-American Planning Council, leading efforts to address community concerns<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
