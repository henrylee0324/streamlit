Still in shock, the victim said she stepped near the woman to ask, \"Why are\nyou targeting us? I'm a nurse and my father fought for this country. You shouldn't be teaching your children racism.\"\nFerrer, 41, a Filipina, remembered the unmasked woman taunting them back: \"Come over here. Say it to my face.\" But worried that the person might be carrying a hidden\nweapon, Ferrer said, she left.\nHate incidents directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are exploding this year, according to advocates pushing for California Gov. Gavin Newsom to boost funding for\nprograms fighting bias and add a cultural representative to his new COVID-19 task force.\nSupporters and organizers of Stop AAPI Hate have documented 832 incidents across the Golden State in the last three months, with assaults and verbal tirades \"becoming the\nnorm\" since the pandemic started, instigated by people following the inflammatory rhetoric of the nation's highest-profile leader, they say.\n\"We seem to have a president that has given the green light to the racists to come out of the woodwork and start attacking Asians,\" said state Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi (DRolling Hills Estates), who represents Torrance, the scene of some the most widely viewed hate episodes recorded on video. These include a stranger, later identified as Lena\nHernandez of Long Beach, accosting an Asian woman who was exercising at Wilson Park, telling her to \"go back to whatever ... Asian country you belong in.\"\nOn June 10, the same day at the same location, Hernandez also allegedly berated an Asian man who had parked close to her Honda, calling him \"Chinaman\" and adding: \"You\nknow what, you need to go home.\"\nOfficials in Torrance -- whose population of over 145,000 is more than one-third Asian -- arrested Hernandez on Friday, charging her with battery stemming from a separate\nconfrontation with a female bystander at Del Amo Fashion Center last October. Authorities have been flooded with calls about the harassment in June, along with another in\nwhich a racist letter posted on the front door of a cookware shop warned the owner: \"Go back to Japan.... We are going to bomb your store if you don't listen and we know\nwhere you live.\"\nMuratsuchi joined state Assemblyman David Chiu (D-San Francisco), chair of the Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, and founders of Stop AAPI Hate, the most prominent\naggregator of incidents, at a news conference last week to denounce structural racism.\nAdvocates had asked Newsom for $1.4 million to fund research on how the coronavirus is affecting AAPI health in connection to racism and to establish a racial bias strike team\nto investigate the mounting problem of COVID-19-related hate incidents against Asian Americans. But the state budget, voted on last month, excluded money for initiatives\nsupported by the Asian American community.\n\"Asian Americans need to see concrete actions, and we're here to work with the state to ensure that we can live free from racial discrimination and enjoy equal rights and\naccess,\" said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and a founder of Stop AAPI Hate.\nEarly in the global health crisis, when residents were learning about the coronavirus, business activity in the San Francisco Chinatown area that Chiu represents started dropping\nby half, he said.\nHe also highlighted the case of an older man beaten while collecting cans in the city's Bayview district. An attacker swung a metal bar at the victim while others, shouting racial\nslurs, continued to mock him.\n\"It's incredibly disturbing. There's not just a pandemic of health -- there's a pandemic of hate,\" Chiu said. He points a finger at President Trump's casual use of terms such as\n\"kung flu\" and \"China virus\" at rallies and press briefings, behavior mirrored by citizens imitating him in everyday speech and inciting hate.\nParticipants at the news conference cited a new report of multiple examples across 34 counties, including an Asian American family in Los Angeles who said they were harassed\ninside the elevator at their apartment building. A couple not wearing face coverings told them \"this f-- virus came from your mother-- country\" and \"you nasty as roaches.\"\nAnother Asian American in Los Angeles reported that \"our Zoom feed was hacked by white supremacists who verbally attacked our members and viewers with racial slurs and\nanti-immigrant remarks. They also hacked into our Zoom chat, typing the Nazi salute and pro-Trump messages.\"\nCounted in the 800-plus incidents taking place at retail stores, work, school and online are 81 incidents of assault and 64 potential civil rights violations, according to Stop AAPI\nHate.\nIn Rosemead, an Asian American said that \"three Hispanic and two white individuals entered the store and cut in front of me. I spoke up and said, 'Hey, I've been in line and I'm\nnext.' \" The strangers turned and yelled out names, he said, spitting at the individual and telling him to keep waiting. A cashier said they should stop and asked if the shopper\nwanted to alert police. \"I declined and left the store immediately, not wanting any more confrontation,\" he said.\nIn San Francisco, an Asian American reported that someone threw a glass bottle at her friend while she was putting her baby in the car and yelled a racist epithet.
