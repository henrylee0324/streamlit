The majority of complaints were made in March and April, and about 42% have been specifically anti-Asian incidents.\nThe influx of calls prompted the commission to form a task force in early April to address the incidents, including discrimination in housing or employment based on race, age, immigration status or disability. Several of the calls were from disabled or immunocompromised tenants whose landlords or co-op boards had restricted deliveries of groceries or other purchases.\n\"The response team came together because we saw that we had so many inquiries coming in after this pandemic started,\" said Sapna Raj, deputy commissioner of the commission's law enforcement bureau. \"We realized we needed to respond rapidly to unique issues that New Yorkers were facing.\"\nThe commission acts as a city watchdog and enforces human-rights laws. It can seek civil penalties against an individual or business accused of discrimination.\nBetween Feb. 1 and April 16, the commission received 105 reports of anti-Asian incidents, compared with five in the same time frame last year. Out of the discrimination reports, 91 were for harassment, five were for housing and nine were for public accommodation.\nHate crimes against Asian-Americans have risen this year as well, while the number of overall crimes in New York City has fallen. Between March 7 and April 2, the New York Police Department received reports of 11 hate crimes related to the disease and made seven arrests.\nFollowing an inquiry, the human-rights commission may advise on a caller's rights and intervene, or open up a longer-term investigation. If the commission determines the complaint to be a hate crime, the case is passed along to the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force.\nAs the original coronavirus outbreak in China morphed into a global pandemic, Chinese-Americans and others of Asian descent have reported more cases of racism and discrimination. However, broader data on the discrimination is sparse.\nManjusha P. Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, said members of Asian communities may be reluctant to report incidents because of immigration and policing concerns.\nShe said the organization was alerted to its first coronavirus-related discrimination issue in early February, after a middle-school child in Los Angeles was accused by another student of having the disease. An online form for reporting similar cases that launched on March 19 has garnered about 1,500 responses across 46 states, most notably in California and New York, ranging from refusal of service to physical attacks.\n\"Even though the numbers are small overall, I think it's an indication of what we're seeing across the country,\" Ms. Kulkarni said. \"All those efforts are important to get a better understanding of the problem.\"\nWayne Ho, president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a nonprofit that provides social services to Asian-Americans, said he started noticing the fallout as early as January, in the form of snide remarks and the avoidance of Chinese businesses.\nMr. Ho said new policies and enforcement of legislation can help protect against discrimination in housing and jobs, but an increase in harassment requires more social outreach.\n\"I have staff members who have been spit on by people, people have yelled at them or made comments on the subway,\" he said. \"People have thrown everything from pieces of paper to their leftover lunch.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is a major metropolitan area in the United States that has seen a rise in coronavirus-related discrimination, particularly against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Commission on Human Rights in New York City is responsible for enforcing human rights laws and addressing discrimination complaints.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAPNA RAJ<|>PERSON<|>Sapna Raj is the deputy commissioner of the Commission on Human Rights' law enforcement bureau, involved in responding to discrimination complaints.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has led to increased discrimination against Asian-Americans in New York City.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC POLICY AND PLANNING COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council is an organization that addresses issues affecting Asian communities, including discrimination related to COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE-AMERICAN PLANNING COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese-American Planning Council is a nonprofit organization that provides social services to Asian-Americans and addresses discrimination issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAYNE HO<|>PERSON<|>Wayne Ho is the president of the Chinese-American Planning Council and has observed the impact of discrimination on Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NYPD HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The NYPD Hate Crime Task Force investigates hate crimes, including those related to discrimination against Asian-Americans during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>The Commission on Human Rights operates within New York City to address discrimination complaints arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAPNA RAJ<|>COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS<|>Sapna Raj is the deputy commissioner of the Commission on Human Rights, overseeing responses to discrimination complaints.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS<|>The Commission on Human Rights has received complaints related to discrimination spurred by fears over COVID-19.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC POLICY AND PLANNING COUNCIL<|>COVID-19<|>The Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council addresses discrimination issues that have arisen due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAYNE HO<|>CHINESE-AMERICAN PLANNING COUNCIL<|>Wayne Ho is the president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, which provides services to Asian-Americans facing discrimination.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NYPD HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS<|>The NYPD Hate Crime Task Force collaborates with the Commission on Human Rights to investigate hate crimes related to discrimination.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>WAYNE HO<|>Wayne Ho has noted the increase in discrimination against Asian-Americans due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
