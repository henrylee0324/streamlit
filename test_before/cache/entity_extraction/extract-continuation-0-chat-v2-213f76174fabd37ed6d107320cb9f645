The father of two said the incident greatly disturbed his son and sent home crying another Asian American child who witnessed the scene. After the parents reported it to school officials, the student who made the statement apologized.\nBut in the following days, before the school closed, Zhao felt somewhat uneasy when dropping his son off in the morning.\n\"I didn't know if he's going to have another incident at school, if somebody else would say something to him,\" said Zhao, 51. \"I never felt concerned to send my kids to school. But I feel very concerned now.\"\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread rapidly, members of the Asian American community have grown increasingly anxious over what they feel is a backlash against them because the pandemic originated in China.\nWai-Lin Ng, who was born in Hong Kong and emigrated to the United States when she was a child, had never felt the sting of discrimination - until recently in a Rocky Point supermarket.\n\"This was during the time when there was a lot of panic-buying at the stores, with shelves emptying out,\" said Ng, who has worked at the Brookhaven National Laboratory for three decades. \"There was a woman passing by, and I saw her staring at me, and she basically pulled up her scarf over her nose and mouth.\"\nNg, 56, of Sound Beach, at first thought it was just her imagination, then came to realize the meaning of the woman's actions. She realized she had never experienced anything like that before, having lived on Long Island for most of her adult life.\n\"It's not overt,\" she said. But, she added, \"we don't want to get beyond that. ... I think any ethnic group could potentially feel that they're targeted. But if it escalates, it could become a problem.\"\nSome in the Asian American community and experts have pointed to anecdotal accounts and news reports of a rising number of verbal and physical attacks nationwide.\nNassau and Suffolk police said this week that they have not received any reports of verbal or physical attacks targeting Asians on Long Island. But the NYPD this week said that the department has investigated 10 cases where Asians were victimized in incidents related to the outbreak, making six arrests so far.\nEarlier this month, a 44-year-old man was charged with aggravated harassment as a hate crime after he allegedly yelled profanities and hit a man over the head at a bus stop in Queens. The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force last month also retweeted a video showing an Asian woman being attacked in a Manhattan subway station, asking the victim to report the incident so that an investigation could ensue.\nIn the past few weeks, Christine Liu, a board member of the Chinese American Association of North Hempstead and the Herricks Chinese Association, said she has heard of more than a dozen reports of harassment and discrimination against Asians in Nassau County.\nShe knew of no physical attacks against Asians on Long Island. The cases she heard of ranged from minor incidents including Asian children noticing other students moving away from them on a school bus after they coughed, to serious ones such as a man yelling at an Asian man when he took a walk with his wife and daughters in New Hyde Park.\n\"A lot of Asians as well as other minorities are very fearful,\" said Liu, 40, of New Hyde Park. \"It only takes somebody who's mentally unstable to blame somebody in the Asian community and do something about it.\"\nAsian parents are also struggling to help their children cope with the newfound reality in the era of a deepening crisis.\nDavid Chiang's grade-school-age children told him that they've heard others say \"don't hang out with the Asians if you don't want coronavirus.\"\nChiang, 50, of Manhasset is concerned that the growing pandemic has exacerbated the long-standing perception of Asian Americans as outsiders.\n\"They are more American in language and culture,\" Chiang said of his three children. \"Their ethnicity, which should be a source of pride, instead causes social friction and makes them feel like outsiders.\"\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James has established a hotline for the reporting of bias incidents and crimes in the state amid the pandemic. It can be reached at -771-7755 or via email at civil.rights@ag.ny.gov.\nPresident Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called COVID-19 a \"Chinese virus,\" has not helped matters, Asian Americans and advocates said.\nTrump this week said he might stop using the phrase, also posting on Twitter a call to \"protect our Asian-American community\" and reaffirming that sentiment at the daily White House Coronavirus Task Force news briefing. But critics said that wasn't enough.\n\"Unfortunately, his response is late, and a lot of damage has been done,\" said Elizabeth OuYang, a civil rights attorney who teaches at New York University and Columbia University. \"It's better late than never, but it wouldn't have to be said at all if the president himself had not fueled xenophobia in the way he referred to the virus.\"\nOuYang noted that the World Health Organization already advised not to attach locations or ethnicities to a disease as it could fuel stigmatization.\n\"History is repeating itself,\" OuYang said. \"Whenever there's a war or there's an economic [downturn] in the United States, oftentimes it's the minorities and immigrants who are scape\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>XINYU ZHAO<|>PERSON<|>Xinyu Zhao is a gastroenterologist who moved his family to Long Island for better educational opportunities for his children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONG ISLAND<|>GEO<|>Long Island is a region in New York where Xinyu Zhao and his family reside.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANHASSET SCHOOL DISTRICT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Manhasset School District is the educational institution where Xinyu Zhao's children study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WA-LIN NG<|>PERSON<|>Wai-Lin Ng is a resident of Sound Beach, Long Island, who has experienced discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Brookhaven National Laboratory is where Wai-Lin Ng has worked for three decades.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Nassau County is a region in New York where reports of harassment and discrimination against Asians have been noted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUFFOLK COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Suffolk County is a region in New York that has not reported incidents of verbal or physical attacks targeting Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The NYPD is the police department investigating cases of discrimination and harassment against Asians during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF NORTH HEMPSTEAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese American Association of North Hempstead is an organization that addresses issues faced by the Chinese American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERRICKS CHINESE ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Herricks Chinese Association is another organization that supports the Chinese American community in Long Island.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETITIA JAMES<|>PERSON<|>Letitia James is the New York Attorney General who established a hotline for reporting bias incidents amid the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States who referred to COVID-19 as a \"Chinese virus,\" impacting perceptions of Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is the pandemic that has led to increased discrimination and anxiety within the Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XINYU ZHAO<|>LONG ISLAND<|>Xinyu Zhao and his family live in Long Island, where they have faced challenges related to discrimination during the pandemic.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XINYU ZHAO<|>MANHASSET SCHOOL DISTRICT<|>Xinyu Zhao's children are students in the Manhasset School District, which has been affected by incidents of discrimination.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WA-LIN NG<|>BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY<|>Wai-Lin Ng has worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory for three decades, where she has experienced discrimination during the pandemic.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>Nassau County has reported incidents of harassment against Asians, which the NYPD is investigating.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUFFOLK COUNTY<|>NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>Suffolk County has not reported incidents of harassment, contrasting with the investigations by the NYPD in Nassau County.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF NORTH HEMPSTEAD<|>LETITIA JAMES<|>The Chinese American Association of North Hempstead has been involved in addressing issues of discrimination, which Letitia James is working to combat through her hotline.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERRICKS CHINESE ASSOCIATION<|>LETITIA JAMES<|>The Herricks Chinese Association is also involved in addressing discrimination, aligning with Letitia James's efforts to support the community.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>COVID-19<|>Donald Trump's references to COVID-19 as a \"Chinese virus\" have contributed to discrimination against Asian Americans during the pandemic.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XINYU ZHAO<|>WA-LIN NG<|>Both Xinyu Zhao and Wai-Lin Ng have experienced discrimination related to their Asian heritage during the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
