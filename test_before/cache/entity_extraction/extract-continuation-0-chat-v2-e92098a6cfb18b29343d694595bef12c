The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, pointed out on April 16 that the poor in the United States were \"being hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic\". He observed, \"Low-income and poor people face far higher risks from the coronavirus due to chronic neglect and discrimination, and a muddled, corporate-driven federal response has failed them.\"\nHigh Unemployment Rates Leading the Working Class into a Crisis of Survival. According to data released by the U.S. Department of Labor on May 28, 2020, the cumulative number of Americans applying for unemployment relief from March 15 to May 23 has for the first time reached 40.8 million. Given the high unemployment rate brought about by the pandemic and the long-existing structural discrimination and polarization between rich and poor, the U.S. working class's ability to resist risks has greatly diminished. Vox News reported on April 10 that from the catering industry and tourism to the media industry, the entire U.S. economy has felt the impact of the pandemic, and just like the impact of other crises, the most vulnerable groups bore the brunt of the economic impact. According to the report, during the pandemic, the people who are most vulnerable amid layoffs are those who earn the lowest salaries, such as low-wage workers in the catering and retail industries. According to the report released\nby the National Restaurant Association on April 20, two-thirds of restaurant workers (about 8 million people) have been dismissed or put on vacation due to the pandemic. When the U.S. government launched the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was intended to help small-and medium-sized enterprises, some large companies with sufficient funds took advantage of the rule loopholes to acquire huge loans, but small businesses and small shops that urgently needed loans to sustain themselves could not get the help. The above-mentioned report also showed that at least 60 percent of employers said that the existing relief plan of the federal government could not help them reduce layoffs. All this has revealed that the U.S. working class was the first to feel the pain of the economic recession brought about by the pandemic, and became the victims of the U.S. government's inefficient anti-pandemic measures.\n3. Racial Discrimination Being Intensified within the United States during the Pandemic\nThe systemic racial discrimination is a chronic illness of U.S. society. Since 2016, white supremacy has revived and racial discrimination has intensified in the United States. Social tensions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the unequal allocation of limited anti-pandemic resources, have further deepened mainstream society's discrimination against minorities, such as Asian, African, and Hispanic Americans.\nAsian Americans Suffering from Stigmatization. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, pointed out on April 1, 2020 that stereotyping of Asian Americans still happens in the United States, and when reporting on the COVID-19 situation, some U.S. media always attach photos of Asian faces. The website of The New York Times observed on April 16 that the COVID-19 pandemic meant isolation for Asian Americans. Since the outbreak of the virus, Asian Americans have often been humiliated and even attacked in public places. Some U.S.politicians even deliberately misled the public. After the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus \"COVID- 19\", senior U.S. leaders, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, still insisted on referring to the virus as the \"Chinese virus\" or \"Wuhan virus\". They also refused to correct that mistake even after being strongly criticized by the international community. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 and April 21 that politicians of relevant countries proactively expressed xenophobic opinions or made xenophobic implications by deliberately replacing COVID-19 with other names that linked this particular disease to a particular country or nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression. The current pandemic-related discrimination has fully exposed the once-concealed racial prejudice. In the United States, which bills itself as the \"beacon of freedom\", government officials blatantly incite, guide, and condone racial discrimination, which is tantamount to humiliating the modern concept of human rights.\nAfrican and Hispanic Americans Falling Victims to Severe Racial Inequality. Racial discrimination is deeply rooted in the history and reality of the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has put this issue underneath a magnifying glass and tragically exposed its negative consequences. African Americans across the country are infected with and die from COVID-19 at a disproportionately higher rate than any other group in the United States. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) released a racial breakdown of the state's confirmed COVID- 19 cases and COVID-19 deaths on April 2, 2020, which showed that African Americans, who make up only 12 percent of Michigan's population, accounted for 33 percent of Michigan's confirmed COVID-19 cases and 40 percent of the state's COVID-19 deaths. National statistics released by the CDC showed that as of May 13, African Americans accounted for 22.4 percent of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States. This percentage is significantly higher than the African Americans'12.5 percent share of the total U.S.population. African Americans in Kansas, Illinois, and Missouri accounted for only 5.7 percent, 14.1 percent, and 11.6 percent of the total population of the states, respectively, but accounted for 29.7 percent, 30.3 percent, and 35.1 percent of these states' deaths from COVID-19.Hispanic Americans also have disproportionately higher infection and fat\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations is an international organization that addresses global issues, including human rights and extreme poverty.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHILIP ALSTON<|>PERSON<|>Philip Alston is the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights who highlighted the impact of COVID-19 on the poor in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The U.S. Department of Labor is a government agency that provides data and statistics related to employment and labor issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOX NEWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vox News is a media outlet that reported on the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various industries in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Restaurant Association is an organization that represents the restaurant industry and provides data on employment and economic conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to widespread illness, economic disruption, and social challenges.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>African Americans are a racial group in the United States that has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of infection and mortality rates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISPANIC AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Hispanic Americans are a racial group in the United States that has also faced higher rates of COVID-19 infection and death during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHILIP ALSTON<|>UNITED NATIONS<|>Philip Alston serves as the Special Rapporteur for the United Nations, focusing on issues of extreme poverty and human rights<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The U.S. Department of Labor released data related to unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOX NEWS<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Vox News reported on the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various sectors<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The National Restaurant Association provided data on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on restaurant workers<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICANS<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>African Americans have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of health outcomes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISPANIC AMERICANS<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Hispanic Americans have also faced higher rates of infection and death due to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
