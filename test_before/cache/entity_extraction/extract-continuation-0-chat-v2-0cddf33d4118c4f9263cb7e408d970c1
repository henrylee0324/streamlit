The crimes included assault, vandalism, theft and harassment.In August, the steep rise in bias crimes against Asian people prompted the New York City Police Department to form a special task force to investigate them.“It was a huge uptick, so much so that people were starting to talk about it, and we needed to address the situation,” said Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, the task force’s director.But in 2021, some community organizers and advocacy groups, including Stop AAPI Hate, have said Asian Americans must look beyond calling for increased police presence in neighborhoods to achieve that justice.“We recognize that policing has led to the criminalization of communities of color, and mass incarceration,” Jeung said. “Why perpetuate a system that doesn’t work?”The people arrested in both the Chinatown incident in Oakland and the fatal assault on Ratanapakdee are Black, which community organizers said has brought to the fore some anti-Black racism, particularly as outrage about the attacks has spread on social media.Lai Wa Wu, policy and alliance director for the San Francisco-based Chinese Progressive Association, said that while the influence of the former president was a new factor, the tensions among communities of color were not new and neither were the systemic inequities that perpetuate them.Younger activists have harnessed social media to raise awareness and circulate calls to action, including fundraising drives and volunteer initiatives.Eda Yu, 25, a writer and journalist who is half Chinese and half Indonesian, and her partner, Myles Thompson, a Black designer, saw news of the attacks and recognized the strong emotions they raised. The couple, she said, “wanted to come together and create a project that was rooted in solidarity.”They made an Instagram slideshow they hoped would serve as a piece of protest art and a resource for those who want to help.The first image, Yu said, was meant to look like a poster.“Please! Protect our elders,” it reads. “Support our Chinatowns. Support our communities.”The rest includes a timeline of incidents and a list of community organizations working in Asian communities in the Bay Area. They listed each organization’s website and created a GoFundMe to donate to all the organizations at once; they would split up the money, and one of their employers said they would match contributions. The initial goal was to raise $5,000. In two days, they raised $50,000.“It was crazy,” Yu said.The couple is working with the director of API Equality — Northern California to distribute the funds fairly and transparently.Esther Kim, 22, said that when she first heard that some $10,000 worth of cash, tablets and computers had been stolen from her family’s small Korean restaurant, The Crew, in San Francisco’s Sunset district, it felt as if it could have been the last in a long line of devastating blows.On top of the financial loss to the restaurant, which her family treated like a second home, irreplaceable documents — Kim’s diploma, her mother’s handwritten journals, immigration paperwork, receipts — were also gone.Her mother, a cancer survivor, had continued to cook and serve takeout though she was at risk of getting sick from the virus. Kim said her parents are not native English speakers, so navigating the applications for pandemic relief and other government programs was challenging.The break-in came amid what she said had been a spate of similar burglaries or robberies in the neighborhood. “In the Sunset, there’s a lot of Chinese grandparents that run family restaurants that take cash only,” she said.Kim said that her friends persuaded her to start a GoFundMe for the restaurant and that her family had been amazed by and thankful for the outpouring of support.While she’s troubled by the apparent rise in crimes against Asian Americans, she said her family saw the burglary as an extension of wider suffering in the pandemic.“We don’t see the burglary as a form of Asian American violence — no one got hurt; everything was replaceable,” Kim said. “But we’re in the crossfire.”\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York City Police Department is responsible for law enforcement in New York City and formed a special task force to investigate hate crimes against Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an advocacy group that addresses anti-Asian hate and promotes justice for Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE PROGRESSIVE ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese Progressive Association is a San Francisco-based organization that advocates for the rights and welfare of the Chinese community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Eda Yu<|>PERSON<|>Eda Yu is a writer and journalist who is half Chinese and half Indonesian, involved in creating a project to raise awareness about anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYLES THOMPSON<|>PERSON<|>Myles Thompson is a Black designer and partner of Eda Yu, who collaborated on a project to support Asian communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESTHER KIM<|>PERSON<|>Esther Kim is a 22-year-old woman whose family owns a Korean restaurant in San Francisco and has been affected by recent burglaries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CREW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Crew is a small Korean restaurant in San Francisco's Sunset district owned by Esther Kim's family.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where incidents of violence against Asian Americans have occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNSET DISTRICT<|>GEO<|>The Sunset District is a neighborhood in San Francisco known for its family-run restaurants, including Esther Kim's family's restaurant.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The New York City Police Department and Stop AAPI Hate are both involved in addressing hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Eda Yu<|>MYLES THOMPSON<|>Eda Yu and Myles Thompson collaborated on a project to raise awareness and support for Asian communities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESTHER KIM<|>THE CREW<|>Esther Kim is the owner of The Crew, a restaurant that has faced challenges due to recent burglaries<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE PROGRESSIVE ASSOCIATION<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Both organizations work towards the welfare and rights of Asian communities and address anti-Asian violence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESTHER KIM<|>SUNSET DISTRICT<|>Esther Kim's family restaurant is located in the Sunset District, which has seen a rise in burglaries<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OAKLAND<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Incidents of violence against Asian Americans in Oakland have raised awareness and prompted action from advocacy groups like Stop AAPI Hate<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
