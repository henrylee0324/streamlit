Ted Cruz’s daily podcast was most famous for one thing: daily musings about the U.S. Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. But in mid- March, the state’s junior senator waded into a new topic. While reflecting on his self-imposed self-quarantine, he defended the president for the administration’s response to the novel coronavirus.\nTrump, the Texas Republican said, “wasn’t serving bat soup in the Wuhan province,” an apparent nod to a now-debunked myth that the outbreak began after a woman in China ate bat soup.\nHis comments are not an anomaly among GOP leaders. In a recent tweet, Trump called the novel coronavirus the “Chinese virus.” U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said he thought “China is to blame” for the illness “because [of] the culture” there. (Cornyn later said that he meant to say that the Chinese government was to blame, not Chinese people or Chinese culture.)\nTexas now has more than 350 recorded infections and six dead, with a growing rate of increase — unleashing widespread fear and, in some instances, outright xenophobia and anti-Chinese sentiments among the nation’s leaders.\nWhile health experts are using the term COVID-19 to describe the disease caused by the coronavirus that was discovered late last year, a number of prominent conservatives have adopted different monikers: the “Chinese virus,” “Wuhan virus” and reportedly even “Kung-Flu.”\nSupporters of these terms counter both that the virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, and that other famous diseases are named after the site of the best-known outbreak. But experts note that this kind of language encourages people to view what’s now a global pandemic in overly simplistic geographic or racial terms.\nOne Asian American studies expert called the usage of such rhetoric “textbook racist discourse.”\n“The renaming will have broader meanings and implications for Asians and Asian Americans in the country and around the globe,” said Yuan Shu, the director of the Asian Studies Program at Texas Tech University. “This gesture will fuel a new wave of crimes and stigmatizes the entire racial group.\n“If the virus has already been named by the [World Health Organization] as COVID-19, any renaming is highly politically charged and motivated.”\nThe usage of such terms has also had a social cost for East Asians. Some said they were afraid of coughing or wearing face masks in public now, even as a simple precaution.\nEddie Pan, who volunteers at the Dallas Chinese Community Center, said the incidents he hears about reminds him of the discrimination Muslim people faced immediately after 9/11.\nUsing that language, Pan said, “lowers people’s perception of how widespread this could be. It helps people think, ‘If I’m not Chinese or I’m not Asian, then I can’t catch it.’”\nPan, 39, said he hasn’t personally experienced racism or discrimination in his hometown of Plano, but he said that treating the new coronavirus as a Chinese scourge “fuels prejudice” and could lead to the denigration of certain populations.\nThat denigration certainly isn’t unique to this year. When the Ebola outbreak emerged in 2014, Africans were the primary targets of stigmatization. During the SARS outbreak, East Asians were similarly discriminated against. “Stigma, to be honest, is more dangerous than the virus itself,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director-general, said recently.\nMadeline Hsu, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said some people have seemingly tried to avoid her since the virus began to spread. More recently, when she was at a kickboxing class in Austin, she said she felt self-conscious after another woman, who is white, began talking “extremely loud to a woman next to her about the coronavirus.”\n“Elected leaders using that type of language reinforces this idea that this virus is attached to a particular country or certain persons, which undermines efforts to manage it,” Hsu said. “This virus is not going to distinguish people on the basis of race or nationality.”To be sure, some GOP state leaders have taken pains to warn that everyone is vulnerable to the virus. Gov. Greg Abbott, who has consistently referred to it as the coronavirus or COVID-19, warned Thursday night that tens of thousands of Texans could be infected.\nBut even as fears over the virus have led to an uptick in reports of harassment and assault of Asian Americans and the decimation of Chinese and Asian American businesses, other leaders have continued using the terms. (In fact, the epicenter of the pandemic is now Italy, which has surpassed China as the country with the most coronavirus deaths.)\nIn a now-viral video posted to Twitter by The Hill, Cornyn said China has been “the source of a lot of these viruses” because “people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that.” During a conference call with reporters last week, the state’s senior senator also said that it’s “no coincidence” that illnesses such as the novel coronavirus originate in China, putting the onus on “some of the cultural practices there.”\nCornyn and other GOP leaders who have drawn pushback appear to be taking a page from Trump’s playbook. According to The Washington Post, a close-up of the president’s notes show he once crossed out the word “corona” and replaced it with “Chinese” as he spoke with his coronavirus task force. Speaking with the press, he has repeatedly defended his practice of calling the new coronavirus the “Chinese virus.”\n“It’s not racist at all,” Trump told reporters last week when explaining his use of the term. “It comes from China, that’s why.”\nThose protestations recall other cases in which Trump has used racist language, such as when he said four American women of color in Congress should “go back”\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TED CRUZ<|>PERSON<|>Ted Cruz is a U.S. Senator from Texas known for his podcast discussing political issues, including the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump and the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States, involved in discussions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its origins.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN CORNYN<|>PERSON<|>John Cornyn is a U.S. Senator from Texas who commented on the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, attributing blame to China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEXAS<|>GEO<|>Texas is a U.S. state that has reported over 350 COVID-19 infections and six deaths, reflecting the impact of the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, first identified in late 2019, leading to widespread health and social implications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health, which named the disease caused by the coronavirus as COVID-19.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DALLAS CHINESE COMMUNITY CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Dallas Chinese Community Center is an organization that serves the Chinese community in Dallas, providing support and resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADLINE HSU<|>PERSON<|>Madeline Hsu is a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has experienced social implications related to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TED CRUZ<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Ted Cruz discusses topics related to Donald Trump, including the impeachment trial and the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN CORNYN<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>John Cornyn echoed sentiments similar to Donald Trump regarding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEXAS<|>COVID-19<|>Texas has reported significant COVID-19 infections and deaths, indicating the pandemic's impact on the state<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization is responsible for naming the disease caused by the coronavirus as COVID-19<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DALLAS CHINESE COMMUNITY CENTER<|>COVID-19<|>The Dallas Chinese Community Center addresses issues faced by the Chinese community during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MADLINE HSU<|>COVID-19<|>Madeline Hsu has experienced social implications and discrimination related to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
