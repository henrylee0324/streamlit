Nonetheless, the message seemed clear: Scapegoating works, and it works fast.\nNow it’s Asian Americans’ turn. According to a representative from the organisation Chinese for Affirmative Action, there were at least 300 news stories published around the country between the end of February and beginning of March about attacks against Asian Americans.\nSince then, a woman attacked a Korean college student in Manhattan, allegedly yanking her by the hair and punching her in the face while yelling, “Where’s your coronavirus mask, you Asian b--!” Just a few subway stops away, a teenager kicked a 59-year-old Asian man to the ground screaming, “Chinese coronavirus!” A few days later, a man attacked a Burmese father and his two children with a knife while they were shopping at a Sam’s Club in West Texas.\nAnd those are only some of the most violent events. The reports of being yelled at, intimidated, or even spat at are legion. Some of the attackers also defy our assumptions of the lone, white race warrior: a few of the perpetrators are other people of colour. What stronger proof do we need of our painful divisions?\nOn Monday, Trump tweeted, unconvincingly, “It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world.” Needless to say, his is not the kind of “protection” we can believe in. As Asian Americans push back against what’s happening, I want to believe that other groups will show up for us, too — that they can trust we would show up for them.\nThis is the perfect moment for Asian Americans to acknowledge our debts to other people of colour, and show that we care just as much about anti-blackness, anti- brownness and ongoing colonialism as we do about what happens to people who look like us. We’ve never been alone in this; it’s time to stop acting like we are.\nCoronavirus may be a new virus. But the hate it inflamed was there before, barely symptomatic and easily triggered. We should all assume that we’re already infected — and agree together that we’ll fight to eradicate it.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
