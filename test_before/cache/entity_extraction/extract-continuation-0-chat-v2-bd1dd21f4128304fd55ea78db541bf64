So many are relying on parents from their own communities, swapping information\nin group chats to make decisions.\nMehvish Ali, who is Pakistani American, had a lot to weigh when trying to decide whether to send her two\nsons back to school in Loudoun County, a Northern Virginia suburb. Her oldest son, a seventh-grader, was\neager to get back to school to see his friends. But he also has a medical condition that makes him more\nsusceptible to the virus.\nShe is close with her neighbors, most of whom are Indian American, and her children are friends with their\nchildren. The group chat had become a key source of support and information during the pandemic.\nOn WhatsApp, the consensus was clear.\n\"Everybody in the neighborhood that I know of said they were doing distance learning,\" Ali said. It made\nthe decision easier for her and for her son, who learned his friends would also be staying home from\nschool.\nWhen it came time for Filipino American Julius Paras to decide whether to send his child back to school\noutside San Jose, he and his wife, who is Chinese American, decided to convene a Zoom meeting with\nrelatives nearby. Many of them had come together as a pandemic pod, allowing the parents to split childcare duties and the cousins to continue to see each other. They realized sending their children back to\nclassrooms could shatter their support system and possibly endanger his in-laws, who they visit for socially\ndistanced picnics in the elderly couple's driveway. \n\"We want our children to grow up not just with their aunts and uncles but also with their grandparents.\nIt's just this affinity for multigenerational living that comes from my Filipino culture and from my wife's\nChinese culture,\" Paras said. \"When we thought about how to prioritize all of this, it came down to, 'Who\nis our family? How do we look out for them?' And we decided home is what's safest.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MEHVISH ALI<|>PERSON<|>Mehvish Ali is a Pakistani American mother who is making decisions about her children's education during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOUDOUN COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Loudoun County is a Northern Virginia suburb where Mehvish Ali resides and is considering sending her children back to school.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JULIUS PARAS<|>PERSON<|>Julius Paras is a Filipino American father who is deciding whether to send his child back to school during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN JOSE<|>GEO<|>San Jose is a city where Julius Paras lives and is contemplating the return of his child to school.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHATSAPP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WhatsApp is a messaging platform used by Mehvish Ali and her neighbors to communicate and share information during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZOOM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Zoom is a video conferencing platform used by Julius Paras and his family to discuss their children's schooling decisions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEHVISH ALI<|>LOUDOUN COUNTY<|>Mehvish Ali lives in Loudoun County and is making educational decisions for her children based on local community input<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULIUS PARAS<|>SAN JOSE<|>Julius Paras resides in San Jose and is considering the implications of sending his child back to school in that area<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEHVISH ALI<|>WHATSAPP<|>Mehvish Ali uses WhatsApp to communicate with her neighbors about schooling decisions during the pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULIUS PARAS<|>ZOOM<|>Julius Paras uses Zoom to convene meetings with family to discuss the decision of sending children back to school<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEHVISH ALI<|>JULIUS PARAS<|>Both Mehvish Ali and Julius Paras are parents making decisions about their children's education during the pandemic<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
