A dearth of testing, medical equipment, and sound scientific guidance had\nabandoned them, like thousands of other Americans, to fumble alone through infection with a\ndeadly virus.\nEven if the government had handled the pandemic well, Ranney said, the virus still would have\nripped a deadly course through the country.\n\"But it would've provided guidance to people like that man on what to do,\" she said, referring to\nMcNally. \"It would have allowed him to get a test. And it would have kept people from having that\nabject fear that led them to flee, and to bring the virus with them.\"\nAfter his husband, Kirdahy, called 911 to report that he was coughing up blood, McNally was taken\nto a Sarasota hospital. He was isolated and, within a couple of days, put on a ventilator. After a\nCOVID-19 test came back positive and his oxygen levels dipped dangerously, Kirdahy made the\ndecision to take him off of the ventilator.\nKirdahy's promise to his husband that he'd be holding his hand while he died weighed heavily on\nhim. He asked the doctors whether he could enter his hospital room, and they allowed him.\n\"I'm one of the lucky ones,\" Kirdahy said of being able to say goodbye. He would later test positive\nfor virus antibodies, suggesting he was an asymptomatic carrier.\nIndependence Day: 130,127 deaths\nThere was a window of opportunity in early spring — before Americans were dug intractably into\nseparate trenches, before wearing a face mask had somehow become a defining political issue,\nand militia members were caught allegedly plotting to kidnap the Michigan governor over\nlockdown orders — when the country could have unified in order to beat back the virus.\n\"People were willing to listen to public health officials, and they were willing to take\nprecautions,\" Ranney said. \"We squandered that.\"\nPart of the problem was the contradictory messages coming from government officials. The CDC\nrecommended masks in early spring after months of advising against them, and elected leaders\nclashed over state and local rules — like whether to close Georgia's beaches — in the absence of\na clear national edict.\nSuch at-odds approaches made it feel like safety measures were the whims of public officials,\noften determined by their political alignment.\nThe deepening political entrenchment was led by the president. Trump mocked face coverings\neven after his government recommended them. He publicly undermined Dr. Anthony Fauci, the\ngovernment's top infectious disease expert. He called COVID-19 the \"China virus\" in spite of\nincreased attacks against Asian Americans. And he made an axiom of declaring that the cure —\nlockdowns recommended by top members of his own national health team — was worse than\nthe virus itself.\nThe division thrust into the spotlight government doctors, the kind of career public servants\nwhose names the average constituent might never otherwise learn.\nScott Harris, Alabama's state health officer, said he decided to go into public health after two\ndecades in his private practice in Decatur observing how illnesses hit his Black patients harder.\n\"If public health exists for one reason it's to promote health equity,\" said Harris, a soft-spoken\nphysician.\nHarris encountered the politicization immediately after his state had its first official case, on\nMarch 13. Alabamians in his inbox challenged his counting of \"presumed\" cases, which follow a\npositive test, versus cases that the CDC reviewed and confirmed.\nLater that month, Harris's staff debated how to classify one of the state's first deaths involving a\npositive test for COVID-19. The decedent was a young person who had a stroke while infected\nwith the virus. In a deeply-red state under a Republican governor, Kay Ivey, Harris said his staff\nultimately reported it as \"death by stroke, in a person who also had Covid.\"\n\"And then, within a couple months, it became clear that's one way people with COVID die,\"\nHarris later said.\n\"At that time there was all this pressure — well still is, this pressure,\" Harris said. \"These\npressures to minimize what's actually going on, and people were hyper-alert to try to make sure\nwe counted our cases correctly.\"\nThe hostility continued after the governor issued a stay-at-home order on April 3, in response to\na crisis of overwhelmed hospital beds, infected health-care workers and a rising death count in\nnursing homes.\nEmailers lectured him on states' rights and personal liberty, and sent Benjamin Franklin's\nRevolutionary War cartoon reading, \"Join, or Die.\" Even when email called him a dictator, Harris\nlooked to see if they contained legitimate questions, and forwarded those messages to his staff\nso the experts could educate them.\nOthers explicitly threatened him. \"I'm going to show up at your house, and you better watch out because I know where you live,\" one person wrote.\nThe state gave Harris an around-the-clock security detail and a ballistic vest. They told him to\nfling it on and lock his door if he heard a loud noise.\nHarris's experiences were not unique: State health officers around the country experienced\nsimilar treatment, with hundreds facing threats or resigning.\n***\nIvey's change in policy made Alabama one of the first states to lift restrictions following\nencouragement from Trump,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
