Some businesses were\ndown by more than half by early February last year.\nBy April, the Center for Public Integrity found more than 30 percent of Americans had witnessed anti-Asian\ndiscrimination.\nA year later, Chinatown is a ghost of its former self. We used to feel like strangers who somehow belonged to\none another in the most minimally neighborly way. Now it all just feels strange.\nThe sidewalks no longer come alive with people. The sounds of Bostonians too busy to be quiet are mute. Eye\ncontact is rare.\nDonald Trump used his power as president to paint the virus as China's fault. He empowered folk to act on their\nhate. He openly bullied CBS News correspondent Weijia Jiang. Much like we saw a rise in Muslim hate after\n9/11, with COVID-19 came a cultural complicity in anti-Asian violence.\nOver the last year, Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition that has documented incidents of anti-Asian\ndiscrimination during the pandemic, has received nearly 3,000 accounts of anti-Asian assaults. Sixty-seven of\nthose incidents were reported in Massachusetts.\nWhile this wave of hate may be pandemic-driven, anti-Asian attitudes have always existed in America.\nMichael Tom was in second grade, waiting to swing into playground joy, when he heard kids laughing. They\npulled their eyes back. And said, “Ching-chong.”\nGrowing up in a mostly white suburb in Pennsylvania, it wasn't until 2010 as a Boston University student, that\nhe felt community. Exploring Chinatown and Quincy, breathing in the cultural celebration, gave him a sense of\npride.\n“To be Asian American is to be stuck in between,” said Tom, 28, a Somerville public relations associate. “I often\nfeel like I am not American enough to be American. People readily assume I don't speak English. I was an Eagle\nScout whose grandfather fought in the Korean War for the United States.”\nHe's cautious about leaving the house. Early on in the pandemic, his brother was spat on while running in Philly.\nFor him, whether we are talking about the Hell's Canyon Massacre of 1887, the vicious murder of Vincent Chin\nin 1982, or the recent violent attacks against Asians in America, it's related.\n“White supremacy bears down on all of us,” Tom said. “America has a pattern of using Asian Americans as\npawns. Historically, you can see it with the Immigration Act and then post-World War II, you see it with the\nmyth of the model minority and the way it's used to pit Asian Americans against Black Americans and Latinx\nAmericans. Who benefits? Who is pulling the strings behind us?”\nAmerica has always used citizenship, discrimination, and division to preserve whiteness.\nDuring the era of World War II and the internment of Japanese Americans, everyone from Dr. Seuss to Life\nmagazine pushed anti-Japanese propaganda. Over time the hate was baked into American culture, and it\nshowed up in Boston, too.\nIn 1987, the Asian American Resource Workshop wrote a report, “To Live in Peace ... Responding to Anti-Asian\nViolence in Boston.” The report cites incidents like the case of Chinese immigrant Long Guang Huang, who was\nbrutally beaten by a police officer in Chinatown in May 1985.\nAbout seven years later, when Kibbee Miller was born, her parents knew they had to prepare her for a world that\nwould look at her differently.\nGrowing up in Mattapan, she was not yet 10 by the time classmates asked if her mom packed cat or dog in her\nlunchbox. Around that same time, she was called the N-word for the first time.\nA Black woman who is also Chinese, Miller said stereotypes about Asians make people think they can get away\nwith hate and violence. And anti-Blackness in America affects everything.\nNot every assault on Asian Americans, Black folk, and marginalized communities is by a white person. White\nsupremacy birthed this divisive and violent behavior. A side effect is that prejudice affects how people of color\nsee each other and mistreat each other, too.\n“There's this idea of Asians being submissive, quiet, and nonthreatening. At the same time the model minority\nmyth aligns Asians with whiteness. It's fragmenting us. We are all fighting systemic racism. But to tear down\nthese barriers we have to also talk about anti-Blackness in the Asian community.”\nFor Miller, these are her identities. And she had to fight both anti-Blackness and anti-Asian attitudes to embrace\nherself. To her, the cultures overlap, from the way they center family to how they cherish their elders to the\nimportance of family dinners. And both cultures are experiencing racial trauma.\n“Colonialism is so indoctrinated in America,” said Miller, 29, a Boston digital marketer. “We have to come\ntogether.”\nBut what will that take? Carolyn Su thinks we need to be able to lay all the messy, complicated, and painful\ntruths bare. To understand accountability is not a punishment but a way forward.\nWhen Su moved to Arlington from Texas in 2013, she noticed how teachers were confusing her daughter, a\npreschooler then, with the other Asian student in her class. It was her own history repeating itself.\n“I was very much ashamed of being Taiwanese American because that is what I was taught by all of the\nimplicit messages growing up\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
