Mandy Te reports.\nAs a group of taiko drummers performed at a festival in Porirua, Debbie Donnelly remembers a stranger turning\nto her and saying, \"They're not like us.\"\nDonnelly was the wrong person to pick out of the crowd. For most of her life, she has thought deeply about the\nduality of her identity.\nWhen she was younger, people would tell her she had the best of both worlds when it came to being Japanese\nand Pakeha. At the time, she didn't know what that meant.\nSitting in her Kapiti home, there's a glint in her eyes as she thinks about her identity, racism, and her mother,\nSetsuko.\nSetsuko, from the city of Takehara, near Hiroshima, met Mick, a Pakeha man, in Japan through a Catholic priest.\nShe moved to Wellington in the 1950s, marrying Mick at St Anne's Catholic Church in Newtown. The couple\nbriefly lived in Masterton before moving to Wellington.\nIt was in the capital city that Setsuko thrived as an interpreter, meeting prime ministers and the Queen. She\nalso became a co-founder of the Japanese Society.\nMick was supportive of Setsuko as she pursued her interests.\nWhen it came to the racism, Donnelly says her mother protected her and her siblings from the details, but she\ndid share anecdotes.\n\"She felt she was a punching bag for a lot of people [and] a lot of people's frustrations,\" Donnelly says.\n\"At the time I could only imagine the culture shock, combined with not knowing the language, not knowing what\npeople are saying about you, but knowing she wasn't being welcomed.\"\nShe believes the racism her mother experienced was linked to anti-Japanese sentiment after the war.\nDonnelly's brother, Leo, recalled a moment years after his mother's death when a woman approached him to\napologise for how his mother was treated in Masterton.\n\"My mother didn't put any blame on anyone, but she was happy to leave, and that was probably because of the\nway in which she was spoken about,\" Leo says.\nAs children, Donnelly and Leo recall experiencing racist taunts signalling to them that \"you're not us\".\nThe advice Leo got from his parents, and from his mother in particular, was about being resilient - she used The\nGreat Wave off Kanagawa painting as an example.\n\"It was not what people thought it may mean, which was 'you can't beat the force of nature'; it was the fact you\nbow to the wave but you don't go under,\" Leo says.\n\"There are some things you can't control but you stay afloat. You work your way up and you work your way\nthrough those situations.\"\nNowadays, he sees similar attitudes to the ones he encountered when he was younger come up in pockets -\nsuch as how Asian people have been treated during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWhen it comes to racism, he says, it's about making it clear that it's unacceptable, while also providing support\nfor people on the receiving end, to help them cope with the emotional impact.\n\"People act out of ignorance and fear, but it still doesn't make it right.\"\nWhile Setsuko never shied away from her Japanese roots, she considered New Zealand her home and herself a\nKiwi.\nTheir mother's experience of feeling like a \"punching bag\" and feeling unwelcome is not something she went\nthrough alone.\nLiving under another's roof\nNew and old migrants have gone through those feelings - stemming from the concept of being treated as\n\"forever a foreigner\". Emeritus Professor Manying Ip has studied the \"forever a foreigner\" concept for decades,\nmainly in connection to Chinese New Zealanders.\nSpeaking to Chinese New Zealanders, she noted how they felt out of place - as if they didn't belong.\nUsing a Chinese saying to define the concept, she says it is about people from minority groups feeling as though\nthey are living under another person's roof.\nIt was someone else's place, not theirs, and they would never feel as though they belonged, she says.\nUniversity of Auckland senior sociology lecturer Dr David Tokiharu Mayeda says that, when people think about\nmigrants and what it means to be a migrant, implicit within that are perceptions about migrants of colour.\n\"It's diverse Pacific communities, Asian communities, Middle Eastern and African communities but it's not\nEuropean communities.\n\"If you're from a European background, you're from a migrant community. Your ancestors may have been\nhere for a long time, but you're still migrants.\"\nBut ancestors of Pakeha migrants brought with them a level of power, enabling them to change the systems\nin Aotearoa to focus on economy and profit. This meant other migrant groups were working within the\nconfines of systems created by European settlers.\nMayeda noticed this feeling of foreignness trickle into his students' work - particularly in those with Asian\nbackgrounds - when it came to one assignment that required them to write about their lives.\nThe Asian students who were born here, or moved here when they were young wrote about distancing\nthemselves from their families, \"and they will use this terminology - trying to distance themselves from FOBs\n(fresh off the boat)\".\nMore recent Asian migrants wrote about hating themselves and getting depressed about the racial\nstereotypes they had started to believe, he says.\nLike Asian communities, Pacific communities are extremely diverse - and both umbrella ethnic communities\ncan face being treated as \"forever foreigner\", Mayeda says.\nIn the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, East Asians in particular were cast as \"virus-spreading foreign\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
