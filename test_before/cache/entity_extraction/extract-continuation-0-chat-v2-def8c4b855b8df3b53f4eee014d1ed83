You know what I mean, like this is who we're\nfighting for.\"\nThomas said she has witnessed individuals from Hanover who regularly post \"racist memes, racist ideology,\nracist rhetoric.\"\nWhile Thomas said it's OK for people not to agree about Black Lives Matter, it all comes down to respect.\n\"When it starts to becoming that you're making fun of Black Lives Matter, you compare Black people to\nthe planet of the apes so calling us animals themselves and saying that we need to basically shut up,\nand that it's not true and that we just want attention. That is incorrect. ... It's just not right,\" Thomas\nsaid.\nGilbert has also seen posts online from people who don't believe races should mix or who don't think\nwhite privilege exists. At the end of the day, she said it's important for everyone to be knowledgeable\nabout the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\"I feel like everyone needs to be aware that there is a lot of racism still going on,\" Gilbert said.\n'If we continue this way with all this racial intensity, we will fail as America'\nThough much unrest has led to the Black Lives Matter protests, the movement also hopes to make\nchange for a better future.\n\"I hope the protests bring about vigilance and that people are on the lookout for things that aren't right\nand that they're willing to stand up and say, 'I see this. Even though it's uncomfortable, it's not right.\nAnd as an American, I'm going to say that's not welcome here,'\" Thomas said.\nThomas and Anselmi both also said they would like to see legislation passed against racism both from\nthe community and police.\nHenry said she believes preventing racial injustice begins with education followed by action.\n\"I think the first part of it is understanding where you play a part in the problem and where you can\nhelp. ... Then also getting involved with donating to organizations that are doing things like helping elect\nmore diverse government officials and helping to advocate for marginalized groups,\" she said.\n\"I also think that events like (the protests) get people to think about what's happening and to hold\nourselves and the organizations and businesses and things we're a part of accountable.\"\nMitchell just hopes change comes in time for his son to live in a better world.\n\"I just hope in his lifetime that maybe there's some type of change and some type of shift in the culture\nand people realize that (racism and prejudice) it's so just not the right thing to do, it's very ignorant.\nAnd we need to really get a grip on social matters,\" Mitchell said.\n\"I hope that everybody can live and coexist equally, regardless of skin color, religion or creed.\"\nThomas said she wants these protests to help end the treatment of Blacks as \"second class citizens.\"\n\"I think that if we continue this way with all this racial intensity, we will fail as America, we will fail\nbecause it takes all of us to run this country it takes all of us to do what needs to be done, and we owe\nit to our children, not just our Black children but white children as well,\" Thomas said.\nAmanda Beard-White, of Penn Township, is the executive director of the Hanover Diversity Alliance,\nwhich is currently working to form a Human Relations Commission in Hanover Borough, Penn Township,\nWest Manheim, Conewago Township and McSherrystown Borough.\nThe commission would be able to work with police if someone made a discrimination complaint. It would\nthen review those complaints and decide what action would be taken either on the local or the state\nlevel.\nThey would also work to remove old discriminatory laws from the books. For example, Beard-White said Hanover still has a Sundown Law that doesn't allow people of color to be in the streets by a certain\ntime of the evening.\nAlthough these laws are no longer enforceable, Beard-White said they are demeaning to the\ncommunities of color in this area.\nMariana Veloso is the Quality of Life reporter for the USA Today Network - Pennsylvania.
