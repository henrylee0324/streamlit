While he said they have not filed any reports with police, he has provided police with\nnames of those that have threatened him and his family.\n\"Initially it was mind blowing, but it makes total sense. We're making an entire ideology uncomfortable, it's to\nbe expected. There's a lot of news on the national level that has painted all protesters as violent thugs so\npeople have been conditioned to respond a certain way, we are here to break these cycles,\" he said through\nFacebook messenger.\nTori Gilbert, 24, of Gettysburg, said that when she saw the protest downtown she almost cried.\n\"Because I was like this is beautiful, I'm so glad to see so many people support it in this town because there\nis also a lot of racism in this town.\" she said.\nIs there racism in small towns like Hanover, Gettysburg?\nThomas attended South Western High School in the Hanover area, and although she said she got a great\neducation, it was also the first place she experienced racism.\nShe described an instance where she and two of her friends, the only Black cheerleaders at the school, were\nwalking to a Wendy's when a man with a Confederate flag on the back of his truck drove by and called them\nthe \"n\" word.\n\"I was extremely taken aback because it was the first time I've ever had that happen to me. (My friend) had\nbeen there longer than me and so had our other friends. They started telling me how they were used to\npeople doing it. I did go and report that to the principal and let them know, nothing was done about it,\"\nThomas said.\nShe eventually saw the man again at a school dance.\n\"That's really where I learned to start reading more and start understanding how to say things to people\nmore because it wasn't being paid attention to, no one cared that people were calling us names and making\nus not feel like we belonged,\" Thomas said.\nThomas not only experienced racism at school, but also in the community. She said that people would tell her\nmother, an immigrant from Ghana who spoke with an accent, to \"go back to Africa,\" that her white friends'\nparents wouldn't let her and her siblings play with them at their homes, and that managers at work would\noften treat her differently than her white co-workers.\nThomas said that the racism she experienced in Hanover was why she left the area, \"because I just didn't\nwant to have to keep going through that as an adult.\"\nMitchell is also the child of an immigrant, but his family came to the United States from St. Lucia, an island\nin the Caribbean. He was born in Maryland, near the D.C., Maryland, Virginia triangle, where he said\nthere's a lot of diversity and because of that he never experienced racism or prejudice. Then he moved to\nPennsylvania.\n\"I started to see people with Confederate flags, really proud of waving Confederate flags and disrespecting\npeople or saying things (that are prejudiced). ... It seems like up here in Pennsylvania they're very proud\nof that, some people are very proud of being ignorant,\" Mitchell said.\nHe also attended South Western, where he said he experienced racism.\nAnselmi, a white man who grew up in a very diverse community, was shocked at the racism that he\nwitnessed once he moved to Hanover.\n\"When I first moved here, I remember being at the south Hanover Walmart and being in line and I was\ncaught in between two older white men, and they were just so openly using the 'n' word and just talking\n(about Black people) like they are straight animals that need to be put down ... It completely blew my\nmind that these people, not knowing who I am, were so comfortable with their racism.\" Anselmi said.\nRacism on social media\nThough many people use platforms like Facebook to share information about the protests and the\nmovements, much of those posts are followed by backlash.\nWhile he was organizing the Hanover protest, Anselmi said rumors on social media were circulating about a\nbus of Black people going from Baltimore to Hanover.\nHe said the attention that rumor gained appalled him.\n\"Then I see their reaction to the idea of a few Black people being sent up here in buses, and they are\nterrified. It's like the reaction was like, we're being threatened with an invasion from a hostile foreign\ncountry,\"; Anselmi said.\nThis was his reaction to this rumor, the events of which never actually occurred on the day of the protest:\nFirst: \"They have their own mess down there and I'm sure that not too many people have the time to come\nup to Hanover.\"\nSecond: \"They just got national news recognition for a very peaceful protest that policemen partook in.\"\nThird: \"We are protesting for Black lives so if there does end up being a couple of buses from people that\nlive in Baltimore coming to support our cause then hallelujah. You know what I mean, like this is who we're\nfighting for.\"\nThomas said she has witnessed individuals from Hanover who regularly post \"racist memes, racist ideology,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
