A 21-year-old suspect is in custody.\n\nSix victims are Asian, four of them of Korean ethnicity, and two are white. The killings followed a recent wave of attacks against Asian Americans that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States.\n\nGeorgia law enforcement officials say it’s too early in the investigation to determine if the shootings constitute a hate crime, but they have not ruled it out.\n\nOfficials say the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, told them the acts were not racially motivated. Long told them he has a sexual addiction and frequently visited spas and wanted to eliminate them as a source of temptation. Authorities say they believe Long acted alone.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told NPR on Thursday that the investigation continues but said, \"at the moment it does not appear that the motive was racially motivated.\"\n\nHowever, Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies and the sociology department chair at Yale University, told USA TODAY it’s hard to disentangle race from the killings.\n\nCherokee County authorities charged Long with four counts of murder and one count of assault on Wednesday. He's expected to face additional charges in Atlanta.\n\nPolice arrested Long on his way to Florida, where, he told police, he intended to do “more acts.” He is being held at the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center. He waived his right to an initial court appearance on Thursday.\n\nThe shootings and arrest took place in a three-hour period. Police made the arrest 150 miles from the shooting sites.\n\nHere is what happened Tuesday:\n\n4:50 p.m.\nYOUNG’S ASIAN MASSAGE | Acworth, Georgia\n\nPolice find five people shot at the spa. Two are dead inside and two others die later at a hospital. A fifth victim, a man, remains hospitalized in stable condition.\n\nThe spa is in a commercial area about 30 miles north of Atlanta.\n\n5:47 p.m.\nGOLD MASSAGE SPA | Atlanta\n\nAtlanta police find three women shot dead inside the spa, located about 27 miles south of the first shooting.\n\nMoments later\nAROMATHERAPY SPA | Atlanta\n\nPolice at Gold Massage Spa receive reports of shots fired at a third spa across the street. They find one woman fatally shot.\n\n6-8 p.m.\n\nPolice recover video images of a suspect from surveillance cameras of nearby businesses. Police post them on social media and are contacted by members of the suspect’s family.\n\nThe family gives police the suspect’s mobile phone number and police begin tracking his movements. The highway patrol monitors Interstate 75.\n\n8 p.m.\nI-75, about 150 miles south of Atlanta\n\nGeorgia State Patrol and deputies from Crisp County are alerted that the suspect is traveling south on I-75 in a black 2007 Hyundai Tucson.\n\nThey use a PIT maneuver – a Precision Immobilization Technique in which an officer bumps the rear of a vehicle to force it off the road – to stop the suspect.\n\nThe suspect is arrested without further incident. A 9mm firearm is found inside the vehicle.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a major city in Georgia where the spa shootings occurred, leading to multiple fatalities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is the U.S. state where the Atlanta spa shootings took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>PERSON<|>Robert Aaron Long is the 21-year-old suspect arrested in connection with the Atlanta spa shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG’S ASIAN MASSAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Young's Asian Massage is one of the spas in Acworth, Georgia, where multiple victims were shot.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLD MASSAGE SPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gold Massage Spa is a spa located in Atlanta where three women were found shot dead.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AROMATHERAPY SPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Aromatherapy Spa is a spa in Atlanta where one woman was fatally shot shortly after the incident at Gold Massage Spa.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEROKEE COUNTY ADULT DETENTION CENTER<|>GEO<|>Cherokee County Adult Detention Center is where Robert Aaron Long is being held following his arrest.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FBI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The FBI is the federal agency involved in the investigation of the Atlanta spa shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRACE KAO<|>PERSON<|>Grace Kao is an expert on Asian American studies and the sociology department chair at Yale University, who commented on the shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USA TODAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>USA Today is the news outlet reporting on the Atlanta spa shootings and the subsequent investigation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEROKEE COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Cherokee County is the location where Robert Aaron Long was charged with murder.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>YOUNG’S ASIAN MASSAGE<|>Robert Aaron Long is the suspect in the shootings that occurred at Young's Asian Massage<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>GOLD MASSAGE SPA<|>Robert Aaron Long is the suspect in the shootings that occurred at Gold Massage Spa<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>AROMATHERAPY SPA<|>Robert Aaron Long is the suspect in the shootings that occurred at Aromatherapy Spa<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>CHEROKEE COUNTY ADULT DETENTION CENTER<|>Robert Aaron Long is being held at the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center following his arrest<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FBI<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>The FBI is involved in the investigation of Robert Aaron Long regarding the spa shootings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRACE KAO<|>USA TODAY<|>Grace Kao provided commentary to USA Today regarding the implications of the Atlanta spa shootings<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGIA<|>ATLANTA<|>Atlanta is a major city located within the state of Georgia where the shootings occurred<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHEROKEE COUNTY<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>Cherokee County authorities charged Robert Aaron Long with murder<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
