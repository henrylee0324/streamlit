harassment of Asian Americans in Northern California has\nmobilized activists, organizers, and those that live there to keep their communities safe.\nIn one week in February, a 91-year-old man in Oakland Chinatown was brutally assaulted, a Thai man was\nattacked and killed in San Francisco and a Vietnamese woman was assaulted and robbed of $1,000 in San Jose.\nThe attacks pushed Jacob Azevedo to reach out on social media, offering to walk with anyone in the Oakland\ncommunity who was feeling unsafe, especially older Asian Americans.\nHis Instagram post gained widespread attention, prompting four community members to reach out to him with\norganizing help.\nAnd now, a month later, 700 people have signed up with Compassion in Oakland to escort older Asian Americans\nin the Bay Area community.\nBut that's only a part of what Compassion in Oakland does, Jess Owyoung, one of the four people to reach out\nand help form the group, told USA TODAY.\n\"What we've been doing is going out into Oakland Chinatown and just talking to business owners, talking to\ncommunity members, talking to elderly, looking for places where we could be of help,\" she said, detailing that the group has also helped seniors translate police report forms and pick up groceries.\nViolence against Asian Americans sharply increased beginning in March 2020 as COVID-19 spread across the\ncountry and some politicians blamed China for the pandemic, Russell Jeung, who created Stop AAPI Hate, told\nUSA TODAY last month.\nAt least 2,808 incidents of anti-Asian American discrimination were recorded by the website from March19 to\nDec.31, 2020. Another organization, Asian Americans Advancing Justice – Asian American Justice Center,\nrecorded more than 3,000 hate incidents in its self-reporting system since late April 2020 – by far the highest\nnumber in the tool's four-year history.\n\"It's unfortunate that this is happening, but it's not something that is new,\" Owyoung said, speaking of her own\nexperience with racism. \"I think it's something that has exacerbated and it's been brought further into the light.\"\nActivists and volunteer groups, like Compassion in Oakland, are raising awareness about these violent incidents\nto rally help – and in the case of this group, seek unity.\n\"It's only natural to have feelings of anger and hate, and to want to take action in maybe a negative way,\"\nOwyoung said. \"But we know that that's not the solution and to fight hate with hate is not going to bring us\ncloser to becoming a better country, or just a better community.\"\nNext, Compassion in Oakland plans to secure nonprofit status and expand its mission of safety and community\naround the nation. First, they plan to advise the Greater Los Angeles Area on how to create its own community\norganization.\nThey've also set up a donation page to help bring their efforts to older Asian Americans.\n\"A lot of the elderly that we see were stuck in their homes for a year. And some of these people have just been\ngetting out there just for the first time,\" Owyoung said.\nBut \"there's people that see that (older people) might be afraid or scared,\" she said. \"And we recognize that's a\nfear that they might have and that we want to be there for them as a community.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
