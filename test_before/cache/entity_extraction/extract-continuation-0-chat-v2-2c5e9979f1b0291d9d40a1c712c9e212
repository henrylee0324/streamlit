In less than a week, a Thai man was attacked and killed in San Francisco, a Vietnamese woman was assaulted and robbed of $1,000 in San Jose, and a Filipino man was attacked with a box cutter on the subway in New York City.It's unclear whether the crimes were racially motivated, but advocates calling for more to be done to address violence against Asian Americans say racist crimes against the community are historically underreported for a variety of reasons.Meanwhile, police departments across the country are warning residents of increased crime around Lunar New Year, in part because of the threat of robberies during the multi-day celebrations that begin Friday. Cash is a customary gift.Lunar New Year 2021: What does the ox symbolize, and how will it be celebrated during COVID-19 pandemic?Violence against Asian Americans sharply increased in March as COVID-19 began spreading across the country, and some politicians, including former President Donald Trump, blamed China for the pandemic, said Russell Jeung, who created a tool that tracks hate incidents against Asian American Pacific Islander communities called the Stop AAPI Hate tracker.\"When President Trump began and insisted on using the term 'China virus,' we saw that hate speech really led to hate violence,\" said Jeung, chair of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University. \"That sort of political rhetoric and that sort of anti-Asian climate has continued to this day.\"Acts of racist violence lead to increased anxiety and fear in a population that already has higher rates of anxiety and depression related to COVID-19 than other racial groups, Jeung said.Stop AAPI Hate, Jeung's website, which includes a self-reporting tool for harassment, discrimination and violent attacks, recorded 2,808 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination across the U.S. from its inception on March 19 to Dec. 31, 2020. Another organization, Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Asian American Justice Center, recorded more than 3,000 hate incidents in their self-reporting system since late April 2020 – by far the highest number in the tool's four-year history.The FBI collects national hate crime data, but data for 2020 and 2021 has not yet been released. Two hundred sixteen anti-Asian hate crimes were reported in 2019, according to the latest data available.That number may be just a fraction of the true total given that fewer than half of the victims of a hate crime ever report it to the police, according to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Jeung said the increase in hate incidents is a particular concern in urban areas. In New York City, police data shows there were 24 anti-Asian hate crimes related to the coronavirus between Jan. 1 and Nov. 29, 2020, compared with just three anti-Asian hate crimes in the same period in 2019.\"This increase was cultivated due to the anti-Asian rhetoric about the virus that was publicized, and individuals began to attack Asian New Yorkers, either verbal attack or physical assault,\" Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison told reporters in August.The spike in hate crimes led the NYPD to create an Asian Hate Crimes Task Force.'We just want to be safe': Hate crimes, harassment of Asian Americans rise amid coronavirus pandemicActivists including Amanda Nguyn, co-founder of Rise, a sexual assault survivor advocacy organization, are raising awareness of the Oakland case and the other violent incidents involving Asian Americans. Nguyn said she created an Instagram video about the attacks, which has since gone viral, because she was angered not only by the violence but by the lack of media attention the cases received.\"When I made that video I was tired of living in fear and I wanted to scream,\" she told USA TODAY. \"It’s so absurd that I have to say 'Stop killing us.' ... We are literally fearing for our lives as we walk out of our door, and your silence, your silence rings through our heads.\"In the Oakland assault, the district attorney's office is investigating whether there is enough evidence to support hate crime charges, Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley said in a statement to USA TODAY.The suspect in the Oakland assault, Yahya Muslim, was charged with three counts of assault, inflicting great bodily injury and committing a crime against an elderly person, O'Malley announced at a news conference Monday.Police said Muslim is believed to have attacked a 60-year-old man and a 55-year-old woman the same day of the Chinatown attack.Meanwhile, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Daniel Wu offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the case and are donating that money to community organizations like Stop AAPI Hate.\"The skyrocketing number of hate crimes against Asian Americans continues to grow, despite our repeated pleas for help,\" they said on Twitter. \"The crimes ignored and even excused.\"On Jan. 28, Vicha Ratanapakdee was attacked and later died in San Francisco. Eric Lawson, his son-in-law, told USA TODAY he believes the 84-year-old was targeted because he was Asian. Lawson added that his wife, who is Thai, was verbally assaulted twice and told to \"go back to China\" before the attack.\"Everyone is dancing around the issue, and no one's addressing it,\" he said.San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin filed murder and elder abuse charges against Antoine Watson, but his office has \"no evidence of what motivated this senseless attack,\" spokesperson Rachel Marshall told USA TODAY.In San Jose, a 64-year-old\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where a suspect was arrested in connection with a violent attack against an elderly Asian man in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California where a Thai man was attacked and killed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN JOSE<|>GEO<|>San Jose is a city in California where a Vietnamese woman was assaulted and robbed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is where a Filipino man was attacked with a box cutter on the subway.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>PERSON<|>Russell Jeung is the chair of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University and created the Stop AAPI Hate tracker.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a website that tracks hate incidents against Asian American Pacific Islander communities and includes a self-reporting tool for harassment and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMANDA NGUYN<|>PERSON<|>Amanda Nguyn is the co-founder of Rise, a sexual assault survivor advocacy organization, and is raising awareness about violent incidents involving Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YAHYA MUSLIM<|>PERSON<|>Yahya Muslim is the suspect charged in the Oakland assault against an elderly Asian man.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANIEL DAE KIM<|>PERSON<|>Daniel Dae Kim is an actor who offered a reward for information leading to an arrest in the case of the Oakland assault.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANIEL WU<|>PERSON<|>Daniel Wu is an actor who, along with Daniel Dae Kim, offered a reward for information leading to an arrest in the case of the Oakland assault.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old man who was attacked and later died in San Francisco.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is the neighborhood in Oakland where the violent attack against an elderly Asian man occurred.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YAHYA MUSLIM<|>OAKLAND<|>Yahya Muslim is the suspect charged in the violent attack that occurred in Oakland's Chinatown<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Russell Jeung created the Stop AAPI Hate tracker to monitor hate incidents against Asian Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMANDA NGUYN<|>OAKLAND<|>Amanda Nguyn is raising awareness about the violent incidents involving Asian Americans, including the Oakland case<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANIEL DAE KIM<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Daniel Dae Kim is supporting the efforts of Stop AAPI Hate by offering a reward for information related to hate crimes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANIEL WU<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Daniel Wu is supporting the efforts of Stop AAPI Hate by offering a reward for information related to hate crimes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was attacked in San Francisco, leading to his death<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>SAN JOSE<|>Both cities in California have reported violent incidents against Asian Americans during the same period<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>Both cities have seen a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
