whipped up by Republicans\n\"A man harassed me on the train, forcing me out of the way and shouting racial slurs: 'I agree with Trump... it's\nbecause of you, the Chinese, we have to wear masks.\"\nThat was one of the more than 2,700 incidents that STOP AAPI Hate, a platform for people to report\ncoronavirus-related instances of racism, has received from across the United States over the past eight months.\nThere were at least 46 racially motivated attacks in which US President Donald Trump is invoked, according to\nRussell Jeung, chair and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University, who compiled\nthe incidents.\n\"Another said 'Trump's going to f---you, f------Asian piece of----'... so there's a lot of profanity,\" said Jeung, who\ncouldn't finish reading the example at a recent webinar because of the expletives.\nThe rhetoric and policies of Trump and his Republican allies have resurrected the centuries-old \"yellow peril\"\nstereotype, as reflected by millions of racist retweets and thousands of anti-Asian incidents, Jeung said.\nResearchers at the University of Michigan, the University of Washington, the University of Maryland and San\nFrancisco State University recently conducted a study on how often politicians use the stigmatizing rhetoric\nabout Asian Americans and the reach of that rhetoric by examining tweets issued by Democratic and Republican election candidates for the offices of president, vice-president and US senator.\nThe study focuses on the first eight months of the COVID-19 pandemic to Aug 31, and searches specifically\nmade for tweets that contain terms such as \"Asian American\", \"Wuhan \"and \"virus\". The search returned 1,227\ntweets in total.\nOf those tweets, 136 used or defended the use of stigmatizing terms such as \"Chinese virus\", though the World\nHealth Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise against using terms that\nassociate disease with a specific group of people or a place, said Melissa Borja, the lead researcher of the study,\nand assistant professor of American culture at the University of Michigan.\nPartisan division\nShe noted there is \"a very clear partisan divide\" in how candidates talk about China and Asian Americans.\n\"Republicans account for all of the tweets that use stigmatizing rhetoric, and for almost all the tweets that\ncriticized China,\" Borja said.\n\"In contrast, Democrats did not use any stigmatizing rhetoric in their tweets. In addition, Democrats account for\nalmost all of the tweets that showed support for Asian Americans, especially in relation to COVID-related\nracism.\"\nTrump and Republican senatorial candidates Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee accounted\nfor 93 percent of the tweets that use stigmatizing rhetoric.\nIn the latest report by STOP AAPI Hate, Jeung identified 24 anti-Asian policies introduced or passed in 2020 that\nblame China for the COVID-19 pandemic, bar Chinese international students and researchers from entering the\nUS, restrict business and trade with China, and allow people to sue China in US courts.\n\"All these policies combined illustrate the anti-immigrant trend and pattern of discrimination employed by the\nRepublican Party,\" said Jeung.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
