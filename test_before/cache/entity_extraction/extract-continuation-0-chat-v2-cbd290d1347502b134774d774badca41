We call on each and every member of our AAPI community to stand up for black lives.\nOur AAPI community has suffered recently from economic losses and anti-Asian racism as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. We know that under white supremacy, this violence is inextricable from the danger that black people face every day while jogging, sitting at home or just going about their everyday lives, from both the police and rightwing vigilantism. Any encounter with the police could turn deadly, and this long history of oppression of black people dates back centuries. Statistics show that a black person is killed by the police every twenty-eight hours. As immigrants and refugees and their children in this country, we inherit this ugly legacy, whether we want to or not.\nAcross the country, many of the businesses that were damaged or destroyed are owned by people of color and immigrants, including Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and many are black-owned as well. We express our sadness and sympathy for these business owners, many of whom have suffered tremendously due to the pandemic. However, we stand firmly with millions of peaceful protesters standing against police brutality, calling for justice for George Floyd and demanding a transformation of the system that murders, dehumanizes and systematically oppresses black people. We reject any attempt to pit the AAPI community against black communities. We cannot confront anti-Asian American racism without acknowledging and directly working against racism toward black communities.\nAs part of this, we must examine our own prejudices and deal with anti-black racism within our own community. One of the officers who stood by during George Floyd's killing was Tou Thao, an Asian American. Our community must speak unequivocally in solidarity with black communities to demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and so many others.\nThere is a history of Asian Americans being labelled the \"model minority\" in order to pit us against black communities and other people of color that dates back several decades. For this reason, it is particularly important for us to take a clear stand for justice with black communities in this moment.\nIn fact, our communities have a long history of solidarity. It was the black-led Civil Rights and Black Power movements that paved the way for Asian Americans to gain increased access to education and employment, to challenge language-based discrimination, and for liberalization of immigration in 1965. When Asian people, like Long Guang Huang and the Quincy Four, were targets of police violence, the black community has always stood with us in demanding accountability. In Massachusetts, we've stood together to demand that construction sites be opened to workers of color, that teaching staff in the public schools reflect the cultures of our children, and that political districts be drawn to increase each community's opportunity for representation.\nWe commit to supporting and following the lead of black-led organizing to demand justice for police brutality and murders of black lives, and toward changing systems that perpetuate white supremacy. We will struggle sideby-side to transform these systems and build a better world.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CIVIC ACTION NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian Pacific Islander Civic Action Network of Massachusetts (APIs CAN!) is an organization advocating for the rights and justice of the AAPI community and standing in solidarity with black communities against racism and police brutality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>PERSON<|>George Floyd was a black man whose murder by Minneapolis police sparked widespread protests and calls for justice against police brutality and systemic racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOU THAO<|>PERSON<|>Tou Thao is an Asian American police officer who was present during the murder of George Floyd and is mentioned in the context of the AAPI community's response to racism and police violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREONNA TAYLOR<|>PERSON<|>Breonna Taylor was a black woman whose death at the hands of police has become a symbol of the fight against police brutality and systemic racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TONY MCDADE<|>PERSON<|>Tony McDade was a black man whose murder has also been highlighted in the context of police violence and the demand for justice for black lives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT<|>EVENT<|>The Civil Rights Movement was a pivotal series of events aimed at ending racial discrimination and securing equal rights for African Americans, which also influenced the AAPI community's fight for justice.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK POWER MOVEMENT<|>EVENT<|>The Black Power Movement was a movement advocating for the rights and empowerment of black people, which has historical ties to the struggles of Asian Americans for justice and equality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The coronavirus pandemic has led to increased economic losses and anti-Asian racism, impacting the AAPI community and highlighting the interconnectedness of racial issues in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CIVIC ACTION NETWORK<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>APIs CAN! stands in solidarity with the black community in demanding justice for George Floyd and addressing systemic racism<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CIVIC ACTION NETWORK<|>TOU THAO<|>APIs CAN! addresses the issue of anti-black racism within the AAPI community, referencing Tou Thao's involvement in George Floyd's murder<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CIVIC ACTION NETWORK<|>BREONNA TAYLOR<|>APIs CAN! calls for justice for Breonna Taylor alongside George Floyd, highlighting the fight against police brutality<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CIVIC ACTION NETWORK<|>TONY MCDADE<|>APIs CAN! includes Tony McDade in the call for justice for black lives, emphasizing solidarity against police violence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT<|>ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CIVIC ACTION NETWORK<|>The AAPI community's fight for justice has historical ties to the Civil Rights Movement, which paved the way for their rights<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLACK POWER MOVEMENT<|>ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CIVIC ACTION NETWORK<|>The AAPI community's advocacy is influenced by the Black Power Movement, which has historically supported their struggles<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC<|>ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CIVIC ACTION NETWORK<|>The AAPI community has faced increased racism and economic losses due to the coronavirus pandemic, which is addressed by APIs CAN!<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
