Nine masked performers, speechless, stared intently at center stage. NicholasEdwards, the 28-year-old actor playing the Son of God, made it midway through the “Godspell” ballad “Beautiful City” when, rising to singa lyric about rebuilding, he burst into tears.It had been a long first week, and not just because there was so much to memorize. There were the nasal swabs and the temperaturechecks and the quarantining and the face coverings. And now there were tape measures to double-check distances and translucent screensto enclose backup singers; still to come were costume pockets to stash hand sanitizer.The rehearsal halted. The keyboardist stopped playing. Edwards buried his head — pierced in one ear by a cruciform stud — under hisblack tank top.“In the real world, we would come over and hug you,” said the director, Alan Filderman. But, complying with the rules of the day, he didnot rise from his seat; nor did the other actors, who extended air hugs instead.Edwards took a moment, collected himself and finished the scene. “As I started to sing, ‘When your trust is all but shattered,’ that took meout, really hearing that,” he later explained. “We’ve lost all faith and trust in each other, and trust in the theater. Will it ever come back?”The coronavirus pandemic emptied stages across the United States in March, as local officials banned large gatherings and then thenationwide theater actors’ union barred its members from performing. Now, for the first time anywhere in the country, a handful of unionactors are returning to the stage — two stages, actually, both of them located in the Berkshires, a treasured summer cultural destination inWestern Massachusetts.The two productions here in Pittsfield — “Godspell” at Berkshire Theater Group, and the one-person play “Harry Clarke” at BarringtonStage Company — are de facto public health experiments. If they succeed, they could be a model for professional theater during thisperiod of peril. But if actors or audience members get sick, that would be a serious setback.“The whole industry needs this,” said Kate Shindle, the president of Actors’ Equity Association, the labor union representing 51,000performers and stage managers. Shindle, who planned to attend the “Godspell” opening Aug. 7, video called the musical’s actors on theirfirst day of rehearsal with a message of encouragement and of caution. “Not to put any pressure on you, but the entire American theater isdepending on you to be really smart,” she said. “People are going to look to you to know that theater can happen without anybody gettingsick.”Theater, as an art form and an industry, is facing an enormous crisis.Much of the way it has long worked — audiences packed side-by-side in confined spaces, storytelling that often involves intimacy, combatand singing — seems to make it especially conducive to viral spread. Many theaters have pivoted to streaming, and some are putting onshows with nonunion actors, but even as other elements of society gingerly reopen, there is no clear plan for how or when Broadway andthe nation’s regional theaters might do so.That means many who depend on stagecraft for a living are jobless. Employers — from big Broadway shows to tiny nonprofits — have lostrevenue and laid off employees. Workers — from actors to ushers — have lost their income and, in a growing number of cases, their healthinsurance.Equity agreed to allow the two Berkshire productions because the number of reported coronavirus cases in Western Massachusetts is lowand because the theaters agreed to implement a dizzying array of prophylactic measures for both workers and audience members. Themonthlong production of “Godspell,” with 10 roles, is the more complex undertaking because of the cast size and the perils of singing,which produces potentially dangerous aerosols.The 1971 musical remains enormously popular, with nearly 10,000 productions over the past two decades. Adapted from the Gospel ofMatthew, the show focuses on Jesus’ uses of parables as a teaching tool; it has been staged in many, many ways (at a refugee camp, in aprison, among homeless squatters), and this production — spoiler alert — is set during the pandemic. The visible onstage public healthmeasures — partitions, masks, social distancing — “become part of the parable of being a moral person,” said Matthew Adelson, the show’slighting designer.The acting company — 12 performers, including two understudies — range in age from 20 to 34. A few have Broadway experience, butmost are at earlier stages of their careers. At least three, including Edwards, have had the coronavirus.They are exuberantly grateful to be working. “I’m just so excited to perform for people again,” said Najah Hetsberger, a 20-year-oldmusical theater student at Montclair State University. “I haven’t done that for months.”There are, of course, practical benefits as well. Dan Rosales, a 30-year-old who expected to spend this summer performing in the off-Broadway musical “Trevor,” said that, without this role, he wouldn’t qualify for health insurance next year. And Emily Koch, a 29-year-oldwho has performed leading roles in “Wicked” and “Waitress,” acknowledged, “I definitely needed the money.”Over and over, they said they hoped success in Pittsfield would lead to more jobs for theater artists elsewhere. “This has to work,” saidAlex Getlin, a 26-year-old New Yorker spending her third summer at Berkshire Theater Group, “so more theater can happen in the rest ofthe\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
