A police officer donned in a face mask. A pastor without a congregation. A funeral director trying to bury the dead. This is a new America.\nThe merciless threat slipped into America, emptying its streets, shuttering its stores, wrecking its economy and forcing its people to retreat indoors.\nIn this new country, once crowded cities now feel abandoned, as if everyone suddenly moved out. There is no rush hour on the nation's highways. \"Closed\" signs hang from the\nfront doors of business after business.\nFor many, this coronavirus pandemic involves the most dramatic kind of fight -- for life, for food, for money. For others, it can feel absurdly trifling as they stay inside -- a fight\nagainst boredom, binge eating, isolation.\nThere was Kalee Kamer, in Portsmouth, Ohio, 27 months sober and motivated to stay that way, participating in a recovery meeting that has moved online. Chris Allison,\npatrolling the quiet city of Norman, Okla., in a sanitized police vehicle and with a blue face mask. And the Rev. Rob Lee, a pastor in Newton, N.C., without a congregation,\nsummoning hope amid the gloom.\nThis was America over 24 hours this past week, on pause and full-tilt, as the sun rose and then set and then rose again on a profoundly altered nation.\nMiami\nA trip to a ventanita, in Miami culture, is not just about the $1.82 cup of sweet and foamy cafecito. It is about conversation and gossip, a hangout for nosy retirees and chatty\nworking stiffs. Queuing is taboo. Wriggling and squeezing are the ways to reach the counter.\nOr at least they were.\nFlouting social distancing rules, crowds continued to congregate outside ventanitas, so much so that the county mayor threatened to shut them down. Sergio's, where the\nespresso machine continues to whirl and buzz, rushed to tape markers -- six feet apart -- on the ground.\nNow customers approach with caution, peering through new panes of plexiglass to order. Many scurry off with their provisions tucked in a brown paper bag.\n\"This is my only outing,\" said Daisy Abreu, 58, who works in magazines and left with one café con leche, one guava pastry and two empanadas.\nBut first she lingered for a moment to check in with Reinaldo Mesa, a 61-year-old airport contractor who picked up coffee and a medianoche sandwich. He, too, had given up\nmost everything in his daily routine. Except the ventanita.\n-- Patricia Mazzei\nErie, Colo.\nSherry Maloney rolled out of bed, strapped on a face mask and headed for the Safeway. Today was toilet paper day. Maybe.\nRumor had it that a shipment of paper products had come in the night before. By 6:30 a.m., she was standing outside, shivering with her husband, fingers crossed she would\nsnag a package.\nOne man was down to three rolls at home. A woman said she was about ready to cut squares out of cloth diapers. \"I've been rationing two squares a trip,\" said Ms. Maloney, 63.\nIn the grand scheme of things, a toilet paper shortage at home is certainly not the worst crisis. But it is also certainly not normal in a land of plenty.\nInside the locked store, clerks wiped down shopping carts and spritzed the self-checkout stations. Outside, everyone talked about how a trip to the store had devolved into a\nHobbesian supermarket sweep. Jostling lines. Frantic customers. Stressed employees, exposed to God knows what germs for God knows how many hours every day\"It's starting to get ugly,\" Ms. Maloney said. But it was friendly in line this morning. Two buddies ran into each other -- \"Don't shake his hand!\" one shouted.\nThe doors slid open, and Ms. Maloney strode inside.\n-- Jack Healy\nAtlanta\nTonnia Blount shifted her big yellow school bus into gear and started off on the route she had been running for a decade, only now with no children to pick up and none to drop\noff. They were all at home, stuck in little bungalows and apartments scattered across the working-class neighborhoods of southeast Atlanta.\nBut with nearly four in five Atlanta public school students poor enough to qualify for free or reduced lunch, most still needed their cafeteria calories. So this was Ms. Blount's\nwork for the foreseeable future: pulling her empty bus in front of Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, loading it up with brown sacks full of breakfast and lunch, and then\ndelivering the sacks out in the maze of narrow streets, more like the driver of an ice-cream truck.\n\"I know my children,\" she said. \"I know who is in need.\"\nEvery few blocks, Ms. Blount, 55, stopped the bus and honked until the parents and grandparents and aunties came out. \"How many babies?\" a co-worker in the back of the bus\nwould ask them, smiling, handing the bags down.\nSometimes they were not babies at all. Bryan Bush, 19, came out of an apartment in sweats and a hoodie. He had been working at Six Flags Over Georgia, the amusement\npark.\nNot anymore, he said. He grabbed a sack of breakfast and a sack of lunch.\n-- Richard Fausset\nBoston\nThalia Bardell crouched in front of the laptop she had propped up on a chair, centering it in the roughly three-foot-wide wedge of space between the end of her unmade bed and\na dresser.\n\"Hi, B!\" she called out to the screen. \"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KALEE KAMER<|>PERSON<|>Kalee Kamer is a participant in a virtual recovery meeting, located in Portsmouth, Ohio, and is 27 months sober.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRIS ALLISON<|>PERSON<|>Chris Allison is a police officer patrolling the quiet city of Norman, Oklahoma, during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REV.
