Atlanta Police Department's Homeland Security Unit, which investigates bias- motivated crimes, has been notified about the signs but so far no arrests have been made.\n\"It's doing nothing but reinforcing really awful stereotypes,\" said Rodriguez, who posted a photo of the sign on her social media page to mixed reactions. \"I have Asian American friends that said it's allergy season and they're afraid to sneeze in public because of all of the hate speech.\"\nAsian Americans have reported increased harassment around the globe since the coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China. Asians make up 4% of Atlanta's population, according to U.S. Census data.\nFor the past week, Atlanta police have received calls about the signs, which appear to be small, bronze-colored plaques that are glued in place. According to three police reports, the first was seen April 13 on an electrical box in front of 188 Waverly Way in Inman Park. Another was found on April 16 on a city lamp post near the intersection of Wylie and Flat Shoals in Reynoldstown. A third was found on the Candler Park Market on April 18.\nOwners for One Moreland, the building where Hodgepodge is located, turned in a video of the sign to Atlanta police.\nAtlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said the department's Homeland Security Unit has been notified about the plaques, but added they don't appear to meet the criteria for a bias crime.\n\"Ifsomeoneweretobeidentified as placing them, any charges would have to be looked at on a case-by-case basis, depending largely on whether any damage was done to the property to which the medallion is being affixed,\"Campos said.\nFor the plaques to be considered a bias crime, there must be evidence the crime was committed based on the victim's race, religion or sex, or another identifier. Because Georgia doesn't have a hate crime statute, police would have to confer with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office before they could prosecute the case under federal hate crime laws.\nAnimator and muralist Rod Ben, 35, of Tucker, said the plaques' overt Asian metaphors invite people to place blame for the coronavirus on those from Asian countries and Asian American residents.\n\"No one feels safe,\" said Ben, who is Cambodian and Vietnamese. \"I'm worried for my parents going to the grocery store. Even older people are being harassed and attacked, and if you're not going to leave old people alone, where is (the harassment) going to stop?\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HODGEPODGE COFFEEHOUSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hodgepodge Coffeehouse is a restaurant owned by Kristle Rodriguez located on Moreland Avenue in East Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISTLE RODRIGUEZ<|>PERSON<|>Kristle Rodriguez is the owner of Hodgepodge Coffeehouse who expressed concern over signs depicting negative stereotypes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Atlanta Police Department is responsible for law enforcement in Atlanta and has been notified about the signs related to bias-motivated crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>East Atlanta is a neighborhood where signs depicting negative stereotypes have been reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is a city in China where the coronavirus outbreak originated, leading to increased harassment of Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROD BEN<|>PERSON<|>Rod Ben is a 35-year-old animator and muralist from Tucker who commented on the negative impact of the plaques on the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INMAN PARK<|>GEO<|>Inman Park is a neighborhood in Atlanta where one of the signs was first reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REYNOLDSTOWN<|>GEO<|>Reynoldstown is a neighborhood in Atlanta where another sign was found.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANDLER PARK MARKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Candler Park Market is a location in Atlanta where one of the signs was reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is the U.S. state where the events regarding the signs and the police response are taking place.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISTLE RODRIGUEZ<|>HODGEPODGE COFFEEHOUSE<|>Kristle Rodriguez is the owner of Hodgepodge Coffeehouse and is concerned about the signs affecting her community<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>HODGEPODGE COFFEEHOUSE<|>The Atlanta Police Department has been notified about the signs related to Hodgepodge Coffeehouse<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST ATLANTA<|>HODGEPODGE COFFEEHOUSE<|>Hodgepodge Coffeehouse is located in East Atlanta, where the signs have been reported<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WUHAN<|>EAST ATLANTA<|>The signs in East Atlanta reference Wuhan, linking the location to the origin of the coronavirus<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROD BEN<|>ATLANTA POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>Rod Ben expressed concerns about the impact of the signs to the Atlanta Police Department<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INMAN PARK<|>HODGEPODGE COFFEEHOUSE<|>One of the signs was first reported in Inman Park, which is near Hodgepodge Coffeehouse<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REYNOLDSTOWN<|>HODGEPODGE COFFEEHOUSE<|>Another sign was found in Reynoldstown, which is part of the same area as Hodgepodge Coffeehouse<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANDLER PARK MARKET<|>HODGEPODGE COFFEEHOUSE<|>Candler Park Market is another location in Atlanta where signs have been reported, similar to Hodgepodge Coffeehouse<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROD BEN<|>WUHAN<|>Rod Ben commented on the negative stereotypes associated with Wuhan in relation to the signs<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
