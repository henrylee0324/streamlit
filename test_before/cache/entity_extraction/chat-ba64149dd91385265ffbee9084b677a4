The case was dismissed but was later reinstated by Union County Superior Court\nJudge Mark Ciarrocca on Sept. 11.\nIn March, Martino began to make \"racist comments about Asians\" to Burkhard during the fire department's\ntraining on COVID-19, according to the lawsuit.\nMartino \"mockingly\" asked Burkhard if he had recently been to Wuhan, China \"while he squinted his eyes so that\nthey narrowed in a racist caricature of Asian facial features and left his mouth open,\" according to the lawsuit.\nThe \"outrageous conduct\" was witnessed by at least 19 firefighters attending the training, the lawsuit claims.\nFive lieutenants and a battalion chief were among those present.\nNone of the firefighters present objected to Martino's comments or told him they were inappropriate, according to the lawsuit. Martino never apologized.\nBurkhard's lawyer, Pitman based-attorney Sebastian Ionno, called Martino's alleged comments \"appalling.\"\n\"It is even more appalling that the City of Plainfield was provided timely notice of this incident and failed to\nremediate or repudiate this repulsive racist and divisive conduct,\" he said in a statement. \"Thankfully, New\nJersey's Law Against Discrimination does not change with the political winds and always prohibits discrimination\neven when a person's race or ethnicity may not be popular due to external world events.\"\nPlainfield did not respond to requests for comment.\nMartino's conduct has resulted in a workplace where firefighters \"now believe it is acceptable workplace behavior\nto openly disparage Asian-Americans for their race and as being responsible for the spread of Coronavirus,\"\naccording to the lawsuit.\nBecause of Martino's \"grossly discriminatory conduct,\" Burkhard has been subjected to a hostile workplace\nenvironment because of his race.\nMartino has also been involved in several other \"harassment incidents,\" according to the lawsuit.\nBurkhard, in his lawsuit, contends that Plainfield and Martino violated the state Law Against Discrimination in\ndisregard of his rights.\nAs a result, Burkhard has suffered annoyance, inconvenience, stress, anxiety, humiliation, depression and\nsevere emotional distress, the lawsuit says.\nBurkhard's lawsuit is not the first time racial discrimination has been alleged at the Plainfield Fire Department.\nIn 2018, Plainfield agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a former deputy fire chief alleging he was\nthe victim of discrimination.\nJeffrey Courtney, who is white, filed a lawsuit in 2016 against former Plainfield Fire Chief Frank Tidwell, the city\nand fire department alleging that he was not promoted to chief based on the color of his skin.\nThe settlement also included Courtney's retirement. According to public records, Courtney made $140,140 as\ndeputy fire chief.\nTidwell filed his own lawsuit against the city, the mayor and multiple officials alleging that they engaged in a\nconspiracy to force him into retirement. Mayor Adrian Mapp was dismissed from the lawsuit last year.\nThe lawsuit is ongoing in Union County Superior Court.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
