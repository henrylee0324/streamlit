Another Asian woman in Midtown Manhattan was punched in the face for not wearing a mask. In London, a Singaporean was subjected to what police described as a \"racially aggravated assault\". There are more insults: People have been heard to utter \"coronavirus\" when individuals of Asian origin, particularly with Chinese features, pass by. Other slurs, such as \"kung flu\", have emerged. In times of one of the worst pandemics to afflict humans in a century, fear and foreboding are the order of the day. At last count, the number of Covid-19 cases has crossed 800,000 and deaths have exceeded 38,000. While scapegoating is not uncommon in difficult times, it has since taken on a nasty edge.\nThe President of the United States, the country with the highest count now of afflicted individuals, has repeatedly called it the \"Chinese virus\". While Mr Donald Trump has eased back on using the term after reports of racially motivated attacks on Asian Americans, his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has stepped up talk of the \"Wuhan virus\". In fact, he squabbled with several Group of Seven peers who wanted him to drop the term. Fortunately, however, there are enough sensible Americans around. They include former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who made it a point to announce that he would dine in a Chinese restaurant.\nThe fact remains that China is as much a victim of the Covid-19 pandemic as any other suffering nation. While the origin of the coronavirus is thought to be in Wuhan, there is every chance that some of what is taken as common knowledge today may be upended and reversed in the future. While Beijing should have been more prompt in alerting the world to the virus, this should not be equated with China being responsible for the outbreak. Besides, having taken draconian measures to achieve a measure of control over the pandemic within its borders, it has now embarked on helping many of the most critically affected nations in Europe, Africa and Asia with medical equipment and trained staff on the ground.\nCountries, including Singapore, must be especially careful to prevent this other virus - xenophobia - from taking root. While it has had many manifestations in the past, it is currently showing up as Sinophobia. Petitions calling for a ban on travellers from China, as well as religious preachers who post on social media that the outbreak was \"divine retribution\" for China's past actions, do an immense disservice to a nation with claims to having strict adherence to tolerance and multiracialism. While governments can, and should, act against race-based targeting, xenophobia must ultimately be tackled from the ground up. This means that public recognition of the menace - and safe distancing from it - is essential to thwarting it.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MANHATTAN<|>GEO<|>Manhattan is a borough of New York City where incidents of racially motivated attacks against Asian individuals occurred during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIDTOWN MANHATTAN<|>GEO<|>Midtown Manhattan is an area in New York City where an Asian woman was assaulted for not wearing a mask.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONDON<|>GEO<|>London is a city where a Singaporean was subjected to a racially aggravated assault.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>GEO<|>Singapore is a country mentioned in the context of being careful to prevent xenophobia during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a pandemic that has caused widespread fear and scapegoating, particularly against individuals of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the President of the United States who referred to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus\".)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIKE POMPEO<|>PERSON<|>Mike Pompeo is the Secretary of State who referred to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\".)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG<|>PERSON<|>Michael Bloomberg is a former mayor of New York who publicly supported dining in a Chinese restaurant during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is the country where the coronavirus is thought to have originated and has been a victim of the pandemic as well.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is the city in China believed to be the origin of the coronavirus outbreak.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE<|>GEO<|>Europe is mentioned as one of the regions critically affected by the pandemic, receiving help from China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFRICA<|>GEO<|>Africa is mentioned as one of the regions critically affected by the pandemic, receiving help from China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIA<|>GEO<|>Asia is mentioned as one of the regions critically affected by the pandemic, receiving help from China.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANHATTAN<|>MIDTOWN MANHATTAN<|>Both locations in New York City where racially motivated attacks against Asian individuals occurred during the pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LONDON<|>SINGAPORE<|>Both locations are mentioned in the context of racially motivated attacks and the need to prevent xenophobia during the pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Donald Trump referred to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus\", contributing to the stigma against Asian individuals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>MIKE POMPEO<|>Mike Pompeo referred to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\", which is associated with racially charged language<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG<|>COVID-19<|>Michael Bloomberg publicly supported dining in a Chinese restaurant during the COVID-19 pandemic, countering xenophobia<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>CHINA<|>China is the country where the coronavirus originated and has been affected by the pandemic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WUHAN<|>COVID-19<|>Wuhan is the city where the coronavirus outbreak is believed to have started<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPE<|>CHINA<|>China has provided medical assistance to critically affected nations in Europe during the pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFRICA<|>CHINA<|>China has provided medical assistance to critically affected nations in Africa during the pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIA<|>CHINA<|>China has provided medical assistance to critically affected nations in Asia during the pandemic<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
