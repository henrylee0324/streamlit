Speaking at the “LA vs. Hate –\nStop AAPI Hate Press Conference” press briefing March 8 morning, Ito said he does not yet know whether the\nincident will be investigated as a hate crime.\n“Our immediate response was anger and hurt. But then we leaned on our Buddhist teachings to find\ncompassion,” said the bishop, adding: “We are working to create a community of friends.”\nThe vandalism at the temple is the most recent of a string of anti Asian American incidents which have been\nsweeping the country over the past year. The web portal Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative of the Asian Pacific Policy\nand Planning Council, has logged 250 incidents in Los Angeles County over the past 12 months.\nNationwide, over 2,800 hate incidents — including violent attacks against elderly Asian Americans — have been\nreported on the Stop AAPI Hate portal. Advocates at the briefing said that number represented an under-count: most anti-Asian hate incidents go unreported.\nOn March 9, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted on a motion to expand the LA vs Hate initiative\nand the Rapid Response Network, both of which support victims of hate crimes and incidents with support and\nresources, including mental health counseling. The County has established the 211 hotline, which allows victims\nto immediately call for help. The motion is sponsored by LA County Supervisor Hilda Solis.\n“The situation has got worse over the past year. The person with the loudest bullhorn has mocked our\ncommunity,” said Solis at the March 8 press conference, adding that the 211 hotline has reported more than\n800 hate incidents in LA County. “The vast majority of hate crimes go unreported,” she said.\nLA County Supervisor Holly Mitchell, who also attended the press conference, said: “Just like COVID, hate has\nspread rapidly. It’s disheartening to see women, children, the elderly, and even health care workers who have\nput themselves on the front lines for us, are being targeted.”\nShelly Shen, a long-time resident of West Covina, California — the bucolic burb which served as the backdrop\nfor Rachel Bloom’s comedy series “Crazy Ex Girlfriend” — said she lived in a “wonderful community” that had\nnonetheless experienced hate. Over the past year, one nearby family has kept up a persistent attack on her\nfamily and her neighbors.\nShen was bitten by the family’s dog, when out on a walk with her dog; the racist family set up a fight between\nthe two dogs, she said. “They told me they were going to eat my dog,” said Shen, who still suffers scars from\nthe dog bites.\nLaw enforcement were not supportive, until Shen got LA vs. Hate involved. “They brought us law enforcement\nhelp and emotional support,” said Shen. “We no longer felt like we were alone.”\n“Don’t think this problem will go away if we ignore it: it won’t. Only together will we come out of this dark time,”\nsaid Shen.\nLaw enforcement was also unresponsive for Hong Lee, a young resident of Los Angeles. Lee had gone into a\nrestaurant to pick up food. A man approached her, handed her a card, and invited her to lunch. When she\ndeclined, noting that she was married, the man started up a seemingly unending volley of verbal, racist abuse.\nThe staff at the restaurant would not help. Lee phoned 911. Police officers arriving at the scene cited the lack of\na crime and did not take a police report. “There was a lack of empathy and compassion,” said Lee, adding later\nthat she continues to suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and was afraid to leave her house for several\nmonths.\nLee shared a video of the incident on her social media pages: five other women, who had faced the same abuse\nby the same man, came forward. The LAPD subsequently apologized to Lee and took her report.\nLee advised people to take a video, if possible, and to attempt to de-escalate the situation. She asked people\nwho witness a hate crime to speak to the offender, and also to provide emotional support. “People have had\nacid thrown at them; faces have been slashed,” she stated emotionally.\nOther speakers at the press conference were: Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón; Robin S.\nToma, Executive Director of the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations, and Assistant Director of\nthe Los Angeles County department of Workforce Development, Aging and Community Services; Manjusha\nKulkarni, Executive Director, Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, and representative of StopAAPIHate; and\nFredrick Sykes, former Sheriff’s deputy, Mayor and City Councilmember of West Covina and currently a\ncommissioner of the LACCHR.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HIGASHI HONGANJI BUDDHIST TEMPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Higashi Honganji Buddhist Temple is a 117-year-old temple located in Los Angeles County's Little Tokyo neighborhood, which was vandalized in a recent incident.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNITA SOHRABJI<|>PERSON<|>Sunita Sohrabji is a contributing editor for Ethnic Media Services, reporting on issues affecting ethnic communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORIAKI ITO<|>PERSON<|>Bishop Noriaki Ito is the head priest of the Higashi Honganji Buddhist Temple, who spoke about the vandalism incident.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LA VS.
