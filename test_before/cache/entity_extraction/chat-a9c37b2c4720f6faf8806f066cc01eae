You know, 'What's going on? What do you need?'” he said.\nOnce home to immigrants and working-class families, the neighborhoods around Chinatown are gentrifying\nand now boast luxury condos, as well. Some locals say that people don’t know each other, and don't look out\nfor each other the way they used to. Rebuilding these relationships, they say, would help make the\nneighborhood safer.\nRelated: COVID-19 racial stats: A 'double-edged sword' for some marginalized groups in Canada\n------------\nBeyond the noodle shops, fruit stands, some of the best dim sum in the Bay area, and a church with closed\ndoors and a quiet playground, there’s Madison Park, where a dozen elders perform their morning tai chi.\nHere, Sakhone’s friend, Lee Zitsue, another community ambassador, waited for a grandmother shopping for\ngroceries nearby, so he could walk her home.\nThey often say they’ll take 15-20 minutes, but it’s more like 30-40 minutes, he chuckled.\nWhen he went to pick her up at the store where she’d been shopping though, he couldn’t find her.\n“Oh man, now you got me scared,” Lee said. “I’m scared that she got lost. It’s just the opportunity for crime\nis so high.”\nLee went out to look for her and learned later that she had left on her own, eager to get back home.\nWith the weather getting warmer and people getting vaccinated, Chinatown will grow busier soon. Some fear\nthis means they’ll see more hate crime, so the ambassadors say they’re looking for more volunteers.\nSpecial thanks to the organizations which support the Community Ambassador program and contributed to\nthe reporting of this story: Asian Health Services, Asian Prisoners Support Committee, Chinatown\nImprovement Initiative, Oakland Chinatown Coalition, Asian Pacific Environmental Network, East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
