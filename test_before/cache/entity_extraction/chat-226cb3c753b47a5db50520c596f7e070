Hong described the supplies as a lifeline for the seniors.\n\"The problem they are facing is twofold. On the one hand, the seniors, who mostly have various ailments, are afraid to go out in case they become infected. On the other, they are frightened by all the racism that has bubbled to the surface since the pandemic hit this country,\" Hong said.\nAt the height of the coronavirus outbreak in New York City in March and April, when the death toll peaked at more than 800 within 24 hours, everyone - caregivers, attendants and even family members - stopped visiting the seniors.\nSam Wu, superintendent of the Chung Pak complex, said: \"The overwhelming majority of the more than 110 residents are in their 80s. We also have a handful of others in their 90s and a couple more who are over 100. Infirm, and sometimes immobile, they were cut off from food sources.\"\nBeatrice Chen, from Immigrant Social Services Inc, another NGO based in New York, quickly responded to the challenges seniors faced.\nShe and her colleagues mobilized a group of volunteers, who ensured that bags of fresh produce were delivered to the homes of those badly in need.\nChen said that at the start of the outbreak everywhere was closing - \"the butcher's around the corner, nearby Chinese supermarkets, neighborhood Chinese restaurants, centers for seniors and family associations\".\nBy mid-March even the pantries that catered to the city's poor had been closed. \"Some of them had still been serving meals. People went in and ate - that was obviously a large gathering. Many more (pantries) simply could not find enough people to help handle and serve food safely,\" Chen said.\n\"We started to realize all the logistical implications if we were to open a standard pantry, where people line up to get their food. Standing in line for half an hour not only exposes seniors to a greater risk of being infected, but also is physically and mentally exhausting,\" she added.\nThe Community First Food Pantry Program now delivers about 250 bags of groceries twice a week to the Chung Pak residents as well as others living in tenement buildings in Chinatown and the Lower East Side, where there are huge populations of seniors.\nReferring to city councilwoman Margaret Chin, the daughter of Chinese immigrant parents, Chen said, \"Donald Hong approached Margaret who, thanks to her constituent services, really knows where these hard-to-reach people are.\n\"Every building has its own rules, and you cannot just drop off fresh produce that could rot and attract rats. We often have to go a day in advance to make sure that the tenants will be at home when we deliver. One thing the seniors really miss is meat.\"\nEvery morning, a Trader Joe's truck carrying food arrived in Lower Manhattan, and the supplies were unloaded at 2 am.\nHong said: \"Think about 50 crates of bananas and 340 crates of eggs. We seemed to be the only pantry in Lower Manhattan dealing with fresh, perishable food, as we wanted to give people a familiar taste.\"\nAll the food was sorted and stored at a 200-square-meter pantry owned by Chung Pak Local Development Corp, and previously occupied by a restaurant that closed due to the pandemic.\nSevere damage\nCharles Lai, executive director of Chung Pak LDC, who helped found the Museum of Chinese in America in New York in 1980, said, \"Only by joining hands can we possibly reach out to those who are in desperate need of help yet are hiding themselves out of fear.\n\"The damage our community has suffered, physically and economically, is much more severe than in most other communities. Why? Because we have a president who calls this virus the Chinese virus, and in doing so has repeatedly evoked the country's (United States) racist history, making it unsafe for us at a time when all Americans need to stand together.\"\nA report released by the New York Police Department shows that hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans have risen consistently in recent months. City officials and local NGOs suspect that such incidents are underreported.\nA paper issued by two NGOs - the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action - said New York state has the second-highest number of cases of discrimination related to COVID-19, after California.\nHong, citing examples of Asian Americans being physically and verbally attacked on the New York Subway, said: \"Before COVID-19, 40 percent of the people we served at our Midtown pantry on 26th Street were Asian Americans. That proportion has dropped to below 10 percent, although we now have a line that stretches for three blocks. Members of our community are not coming.\"\nLai, the executive director, said: \"The impact of COVID-19 was palpably felt here even before it landed on American shores. Back in late January, when we were preparing to celebrate Chinese New Year, people were already staying away from Chinatown and Chinese businesses. After the pandemic, Chinatown will be the last place that people choose to return to.\"\nBusiness closures mean lost jobs, sometimes for an entire family, and it is not uncommon for different generations of Chinese American families in Manhattan's Chinatown to run enterprises such as restaurants.\nEarly last month, CNN reported that about 147,000 Asian workers in New York state had filed\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
