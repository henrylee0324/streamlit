{"result": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly exacerbated racism, particularly against Asian Americans and communities of Asian descent. This increase in racism has manifested in heightened incidents of hate crimes and discrimination, with a notable focus on individuals of Chinese ethnicity. The pandemic has intensified existing racist sentiments and actions, leading to a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. The rise of racism during this period is recognized as a significant social issue, as exemplified by the experiences of individuals like Jonathan Mok.
