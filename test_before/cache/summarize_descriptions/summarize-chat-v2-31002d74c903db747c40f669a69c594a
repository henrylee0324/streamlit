{"result": "Racial profiling is a discriminatory practice that involves targeting individuals based on their race. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this practice has intensified, particularly against Asian Americans, who have faced increased scrutiny and accusations of racial or ethnic profiling, especially towards individuals of Chinese descent. The protective measures implemented during the coronavirus outbreak have further exacerbated these issues, leading to heightened discrimination and bias against this community. Additionally, the trend of racial profiling against Asian Americans has roots that trace back to the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, indicating a long-standing pattern of discrimination that has been magnified in recent times.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
