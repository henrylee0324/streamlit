{"result": "Racism against Asian Americans has significantly intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a marked increase in incidents of discrimination and bias. This surge in racism has not only led to more reported cases of discrimination and attacks but has also adversely affected the safety and well-being of Asian Americans. The heightened atmosphere of racism during this period has contributed to increased levels of anxiety and depression within the Asian American community. Furthermore, the issue of racism is particularly pronounced in the context of the pandemic, with inflammatory remarks from public figures, such as former President Trump, exacerbating the situation.
