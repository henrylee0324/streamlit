{"result": "Vincent Chin was a Chinese American autoworker whose tragic murder in 1982 by two white autoworkers brought significant attention to the issue of hate crimes against Asian Americans. He was beaten to death in Detroit, a victim of anti-Asian xenophobia and racism, which was exacerbated by the economic competition perceived from Japan at the time.
