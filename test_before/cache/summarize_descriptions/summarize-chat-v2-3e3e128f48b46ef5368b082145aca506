{"result": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, New York authorities took significant steps to address the rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans, which were exacerbated by the crisis. In response to this alarming trend, New York established a hotline specifically for reporting hate crimes targeting Asian Americans. This initiative aimed to provide support and a means for victims to report incidents of racism and discrimination that surged during the pandemic.\n\nAdditionally, the pandemic has had a profound impact on the mental health of New York residents, with many reporting vivid dreams and sleep-related anxieties. Among those affected are Chinese students, such as Eva Chen and Lyujiang Chen, who have faced unique challenges during this period.
