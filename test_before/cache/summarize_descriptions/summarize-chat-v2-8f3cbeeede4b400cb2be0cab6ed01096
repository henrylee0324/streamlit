These areas have been facing considerable economic challenges, particularly exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing gentrification. The pandemic has led to a notable decline in foot traffic and business, largely due to the stigma associated with the virus, which has further impacted the economic stability of these communities.
