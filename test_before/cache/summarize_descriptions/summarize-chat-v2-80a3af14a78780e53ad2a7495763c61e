{"result": "Canada is a country that has implemented mandatory mask-wearing in public as a protective measure against COVID-19. In addition to its public health initiatives, Canada is actively addressing systemic racism and social inequities, particularly concerning immigrant rights and social entitlements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a survey was conducted in Canada to investigate racism against individuals of Chinese ethnicity, revealing a concerning rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. These incidents have been significant enough to prompt peaceful demonstrations, including a notable dance action aimed at raising awareness. The survey and subsequent analysis focused on the experiences of Chinese Canadians, highlighting the challenges they faced during this period.
