{"result": "The United States and China are two significant countries that have been profoundly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has prompted calls for cooperation between them. Despite this need for collaboration, the relationship between the two nations is characterized by strategic competition. China has advocated for the United States to adopt a non-confrontational approach in their dealings. However, within the U.S., China has become a central figure in the political narrative surrounding the pandemic, leading to an increase in anti-China sentiment among the American public.
