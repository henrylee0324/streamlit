{"result": "Social media refers to online platforms that enable users to connect and share content. During the pandemic, these platforms have been associated with increased anxiety and feelings of inadequacy among young adults. Additionally, they have been identified as environments conducive to the proliferation of hate speech and xenophobia. Specifically, social media has been utilized to disseminate information and sentiments regarding the targeting of Asian Americans, highlighting the challenges faced by this community during this time. An example of this is the case of Shum, who used social media to discuss a hate crime incident she experienced, which led to backlash from some users.
