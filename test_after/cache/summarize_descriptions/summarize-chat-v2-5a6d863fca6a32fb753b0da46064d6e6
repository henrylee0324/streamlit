{"result": "Xenophobia is defined as the fear or hatred of foreigners or strangers, and it has emerged as a significant social issue, particularly affecting Asian Americans and Asian Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports indicate that xenophobia has been on the rise in Canada, with a notable increase in anti-Asian violence. This phenomenon has been exacerbated by the current climate, including political rhetoric, which has heightened fears and hostility towards Asian communities. The rally aimed to address these issues, highlighting the urgent need to combat xenophobia and its detrimental effects on individuals and communities.
