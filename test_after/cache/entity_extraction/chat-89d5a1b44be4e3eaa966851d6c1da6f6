I would then have to politely correct him/her, but the embarrassment and shame that I felt when all the eyes of the entire class turned to look at me was almost unbearable\" \nTo this day, I still don't understand how learned adults pronounced my name that way, but I chalk it up to innocent ignorance. But what happened to me a couple of weeks ago at the 23rd St. subway station wasn't innocent. While waiting for the R train on a pretty deserted end of the platform, I heard a guy walking towards me who started yelling, 'Six feet, b--h, si\" fet!' \nI dared not look up, I was scared. 'Was he talking to me? Was he screaming what I thought he was screaming to ME?' He hollered those words again, so I began walking the opposite way, passing him quickly while staring intently down at my phone. 'Please don't do anything to me,' I prayed. I was terrified he might push me into the tracks because there have been a few such incidents reported recently in the news. In all my years living in New York City, both as a student and a working professional, I had never felt unsafe, unti\" now. \nSophia Chang \nScreenwriter and auth\"r \nI weep for the victims, their families, us. Please spare me your hand-wringing cries of 'This is not who we are.' 'This is not America.' 'We're better tha\" t is.' \nIf you think the heinous murders of the six Asian women in Atlanta were not about race, you don't understand the narrative written by white patriarchy that has historically fetishized, eroticized and exoticized me and my sisters. Furthermore, if you buy into the framing that it's Black folks perpetrating all these crimes and take this opportunity to question the allyship of the Black community, you are nothing more than a pawn of white supr\"macy. \nPhilip Lim \nDesign\"r \nAs a New Yorker and an Asian-American myself, I struggle in frustration and sadness watching this misguided manifestation of hate ravaging our community that is so vital and essential to the beautiful diversity that makes New York. It is difficult enough that we are all experiencing and navigating through a COVID-19 pandemic, but imagine also having to deal with a parallel second pandemic based off the hate of your skin color, your eye shape, the language you speak or the culture that runs deep in you\" ve ns? \nI ask you as a New Yorker, a fellow human being, will you stand with me? Will you stand with the Asian-American community, your fellow Americans to #StopAsia\"Hate. \nJoshua Dela Cruz, theater acto\" \nWhat's devious about white supremacy is that fail-safes\"lik \"he mode\" mi ority were created to ensure infighting. Infighting that ensures true solidarity, tolerance and equality will fail. This is not my struggle. This is not your struggle. This is OUR str❞ggle. \nPriya Darshini \nSinger \nIt's been immensely painful, yet not surprising to watch this surge in unfounded and targeted hatred towards Asians, especially the elderly and women. If there was ever an opportunity to overcome our differences and come together as a collective humanity, this pandemic was it. And yet, once again, so many have chosen to give into fear, depravity and have followed mindless hateful political rhetoric. These destructive voices are only getting louder, and have amplified this state of emergency that America has been in for so long. What so many people in America still don't want to see is that America stands on the shoulders of immigrants, and that its beauty lies in its diversity. Alienating and othering people will eventually leave America standing empty, all alone and devoid of it\" soul. \nClint Ramos \nCostume designer \n--- \nAlthough we are not a monolith - there are 48 countries in Asia - we are a large continent. And we are holding ourselves together. But I also wanna say that a lot of what is happening is not brand new this is not an aberration. This is not just because of COVID. This is just not because there was a president that was xenophobic. This has been happening for a long time. Like the way the dehumanization of Asians and Asian-Americans in this country, and particularly in the Western world, but particularly in this country. I want to encourage Asian-Americans to actually think about those values that we were taught that no longer serve us. Right? The values of like don't say anything, head down, just keep on working. That contributed to our invisibility, that contributed to us not being seen as human beings. Say something. Express your pain. Express your feelings.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
