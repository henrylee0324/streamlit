The video, capturing one of the increasingly common instances of Anti-Asian hate, amassed over 100,000 views. It took the mayor of Renton eight days to respond. \nAccording to youth coordinators at AAPI Coalition Against Hate and Bias, that delayed action from city leadership was the catalyst for the youth-led \"We Are Not Silent\" rally which promises to launch a movement in King County. \nWith the first flyers hitting lamp posts just the Monday before, the March 13 rally in Chinatown International District's (CID) Hing Hay Park drew hundreds of protestors to respond to the surge in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic. \nThe Seattle Police Department investigated 14 Anti-Asian hate crimes in 2020, a rise from nine in 2019 and six in 2018. King County will spend $5 million to support multicultural media and combat the rise in hate and bias, reports the Seattle Times. \nAccording to youth coordinator Nathan Duong, the goal of the rally was to \"shift the narrative\" that \"scapegoats Asian Americans\" touted by leaders like former president Donald Trump. \nDuong says he has been \"overly cautious\" in following safety precautions throughout the pandemic. \n\"Nobody wants to get the virus, but as an Asian American, it feels like if you get it, you are adding to the stigma,\" Duong said. \"With the fear of getting COVID comes the added fear of discrimination and becoming a victim of hate.\" \nThe crowd gathered in Hing Hay Park at 3 PM on Saturday, March 13. Duong says the park was full, quick to add \"but not so full that we couldn't social distance.\" \nA lineup including Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos (D-Seattle) and former King County Councilmember Larry Gossett spoke before the protesters began their march through the CID. According to youth coordinator Madeleine Magana, protestors chanted as they marched along 5th Ave, but on King Street, home to most of CID's Asian-owned small businesses, they moved in silence out of respect. \nDuong describes the energy of the event as \"two-sided.\" \n\"The reason we are there is pain, is fear,\" Duong said. \"But the energy of being there was hopeful, it was electric.\" \nThe youth coordinators say the event went off without a hitch (Duong giving special \"kudos” to the peacekeepers), but organizing as a young person has its own challenges. \nYouth coordinator and UW student Anson Huang says that the youth team, which consists of six college and high school students, formed \"quite naturally\" through previous involvement and mutual interest. Spread from Maple Valley to Monroe to Seattle, the organizers planned the rally via a hodgepodge of Zoom meetings, phone calls, and text messages. \nThe night before the rally, Huang and Magana were on the phone until 3 AM working out the kinks of their script -during the week before finals, no less according to Magana, a student at Seattle University. \n\"I kind of put my school work aside, so I'm facing the consequences this week,\" Magana laughed. \"For all of us, this became the priority.\" \nEven though the youngest of the organizers is just a junior in high school, this event is none of the six youth coordinators' first ventures in activism - and it won't be there last. \nDuong and his Monroe, WA classmates founded and continue to direct the Monroe Inclusion Collective which works with their school board and local leadership to combat racism and bias. Though he is too young to have seen Gary Locke become the first Chinese American elected governor in United States history, Duong spoke in the same lineup as the former governor at the rally. \nHuang, who is studying both computer science and political science, worked on campaigns for Cynthia Delostinos Johnson's Tukwila City Council bid and Gossett for King County Council. His connection to Gossett helped to score him as a speaker. \nThe youngest organizer, Debra Erden-emandakh, founded the Asian Student Union at her high school in Tahoma, WA as well as the non-profit Chosen 1 Family, according to an infographic on the AAPI Organizing Coalition Against Hate and Bias Facebook page. \nMagana, who describes her hometown of Maple Valley as \"predominantly white,\" has been politically active since high school. The rise of anti-Asian hate crimes against elders got her even more involved. \n\"Seeing the news of Asian elders being pushed on the streets made me question if my grandparents are safe,\" Magana said. \"Should I take them to Southcenter? Should I take them to Fred Meyer? Should I take them to any public space?\" \nMagana also has organizing experience from helping set up a Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest in Maple Valley. \nThe youth organizers do not have to look far for inspiration following a summer of BLM protests, led in many cases by young people like themselves. \nAccording to Duong, one lesson from the BLM protest is the importance of healing within a community. In addition to covering miles of Seattle city streets, organizers promoting racial equity for Black folks held wellness events for the Black community. On Juneteenth, the CHOP observed a \"Black out.\" Organizers at Every Day March, often lead gratitude exercises before their morning protests. \nThe Saturday following the anti-Asian hate crime that killed six Asian women in Atlanta, GA, the youth organizers put together a virtual vigil and healing session. \nAnother lesson the youth organizers have learned from the BLM protests is momentum.
