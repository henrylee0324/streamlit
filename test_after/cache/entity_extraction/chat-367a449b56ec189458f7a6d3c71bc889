Every person in our community deserves to be treated with dignity.\"\nXiong, who also serves on the Weston Village Board, said he's heard a handful of stories of bigotry, racism and xenophobia toward the Asian American community through his work in local government and the Hmong American Center.\n\"This is nothing new. It's been going on since last year when the pandemic began,\" Xiong said.\nThere have been 3,800 reported hate incidents committed against people who identify as Asian American and/or Pacific Islander (sometimes abbreviated as AAPI) across the United States since the COVID-19 pandemic began last March, according to the statement. Xiong said that's almost a 150% increase from previous years.\nThe number came from research reporting forum Stop AAPI Hate released March 16. Women made up a far higher share of the reports at 68%, compared to men, who made up 29% of respondents. The nonprofit does not report incidents to police.\nAnd while that number is for the entire country, both Rosenberg and Xiong expressed concern about local incidents.\n\"Am I concerned about that happening in Marathon County? Definitely,\" Xiong said. \"I'm worried about something extreme happening if we don't condemn this behavior.\"\nThe statement detailed anecdotes shared with Xiong, in which Asian American residents of the county were verbally assaulted with racial slurs and told they don't belong in the community. Even though xenophobia and racism were around before the pandemic, Xiong said he has seen \"sheer aggressiveness and sheer directness\" in the past year.\nAs a result, many members of the Hmong and Asian communities fear for their safety — not just of verbal lashings but retaliation and physical attacks, too, Xiong said. Asian residents are afraid to go shopping or walk to the public garden at night, he said. They walk in groups in public spaces and move quickly at gas stations.\n\"The fear is very real,\" Xiong said.\nRosenberg said she's concerned anytime someone in the community feels unsafe or unwelcome, which prompted her to put out the statement. She said it's only a starting point, though. She and Xiong are still figuring out what the follow-up looks like.\n\"There are people who are scared,\" Rosenberg said. \"It's important that everyone here takes a deep breath and stands against that. I think we can get through this.\"\nThe two will work with the City Council and County Board to recommend policies that protect residents and ensure marginalized populations are specifically safeguarded from race-based attacks. In the meantime, they encourage residents to speak up and call out any racist comments or incidents.\nXiong said it makes all the difference to know others are not being bystanders and \"have the AAPI community's back.\" Both Xiong and Rosenberg ask local residents and leaders to follow recommendations from AAPI Coalition of Wisconsin by:\nPublicly condemning racist language and the racist association between the coronavirus and the Asian community.\nUrging media to cover anti-Asian violence to help bring awareness.\nEncouraging the reporting of hate incidents, as many go unreported and hinder the ability to appropriately track, allocate resources and address the root cause.\nHowever, their statement has already caused complaints among residents who don't believe discrimination or racism exists in the community. It's a struggle Xiong knows well; it's the same battle he's fighting with the county's \"A Community For All\" resolution.\nThe resolution, drafted by the Diversity Affairs Commission, seeks to acknowledge racial disparities and discrimination in the community. The measure is a starting point for change and doesn't take any action but has gone through several revisions because of pushback from people who say racism doesn't exist in the county and label it as divisive.\n\"For people to say it doesn't exist, they are extremely wrong,\" Xiong said. \"I hope those individuals will reach out and listen to (our) concerns and fears and what the (Asian American community) has to say.\"\nRosenberg said a good step forward is to open a dialogue about these incidents, potentially through listening sessions. She said it can't just be once, it has to be continual.\n\"We need to make opportunities for people to be heard and share their stories and make it easier for people to participate in the process,\" Rosenberg said. \"We need to figure out how we listen better.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
