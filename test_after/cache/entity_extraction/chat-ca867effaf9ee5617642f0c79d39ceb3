Her cited three factors he believes contribute to the lower percentage returning: multigenerational households, an increase in hate crimes against Asians and Asian Americans and the \"model minority myth\" that leads many to believe Asian families and students are doing well.\n\"Those three factors really as a parent make you think about, as schools are reopening, how safe is your child going to be physically going to school?\" said Her, who has two children in middle school. \"Secondly, how safe are they with coronavirus and potentially bringing it back to their family?\"\nThe Washington Post reported that in New York City, Asian American children make up under 12% of students back in classrooms, though they are 18% of the overall student body, with similar disparities in other districts around the country. Federal data released Wednesday showed that as of January, 68% of Asian fourth graders were learning fully virtually - above any other demographic, and more than double the 27% of white fourth-graders.\nAsian students make up 8.4% of MMSD's overall enrollment, according to the Department of Public Instruction.\nHer, state Rep. Francesca Hong and Lake View Elementary School Principal Nkaujnou Vang-Vue all noted in interviews that the \"Asian\" demographic includes a variety of cultures that differ from each other.\n\"I think people tend to lump Asian Americans in together,\" Her said. \"You have some high-achieving Asian Americans who have been in this country for generations, then you have the recent refugees.\"\nA lack of nuance can make it harder to identify the challenges people in the community face.\nVang-Vue said she works closely with her school's Hmong families, as she speaks Hmong and has built up a familiarity with them over the years. For the families she's worked with, she said, there is still fear about the virus as the pandemic continues.\n\"I don't even think I got two words into the conversation and they're like, 'Nope, we're not sending them,'\" Vang-Vue said. \"The fear is real.\"\nShe suggested that fear, mixed with \"a lot lost in the translation\" from English to Hmong when sharing safety precautions, contribute to the lower return rate.\nHong kept her son in virtual learning for the initial return partly to protect her and her partner's parents until they get vaccinated. She said the district will have to connect to the variety of populations it serves to help students and families recover from the pandemic.\n\"I know the administration is trying to get more resources for mental health resources for kids, and I applaud them for that,\" she said. \"I would hope they would also look at ... liaisons to specific communities.\"\nSchool challenges\nThe \"model minority myth\" perpetuates the idea that all Asians and Asian Americans are high-achieving.\nHong, whose parents immigrated to Madison from South Korea in 1987, called the myth \"incredibly divisive\" and said it minimizes the conversations about how to help specific communities within the overall demographic. She said it can also hurt other minority groups as people use the myth as a justification to cut aid programs.\n\"It perpetuates a scarcity mindset for minority communities, especially Asian communities,\" Hong said.\nHer said it took nearly a decade to get MMSD to disaggregate Hmong data from broader Asian data. Once they did, it was clear Hmong students were struggling to keep reading and math at grade level, Her said.\nKnowledge of how various groups of students are struggling can be key to understanding \"how we can help each community, because each community has different needs and challenges,\" Her said.\nAt Lake View, Vang-Vue said, staffers on her social services team are assigned to connect with specific communities. They reach out through emails, phone calls, text messages and \"any way that we can to connect with them to help them troubleshoot and problem-solve around any challenges.\"\nShe noted that they have delivered food to families and worked to help overcome other barriers throughout the last year, and they're working to make learning - virtual or in-person - the best it can be for all of their students.\n\"When we think about equity and access... (we make) sure that how we communicate home is done in a way that is culturally responsive to the families and ... accurate and true and consistent,\" Vang-Vue said. \"I truly believe that no matter what language you speak or what culture you're from, you need to have all of the information so you can make an informed decision.\"\nHer said the district needs to do a better job for its Asian families going forward.\n\"Hmong parents, Asian American parents, we're here long enough, we're standing on our own two feet now,\" Her said. \"We're going to say pretty soon, 'This school system is not working for our kids.' What I see is these parents are going to say, 'Either you've got to make changes or we're going to make changes for you.'\"\nOutspokenness grows following Atlanta shooting\nThe Cap Times spoke with Her, Hong and Vang-Vue before the shooting last week in Atlanta in which a 21-year-old white man killed eight people, six of them Asian women.\nPrior to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
