Without that collaboration, without that effort, I'm sure we would have individual stories, but they would not have highlighted this challenge that we're seeing.\" \nSen. Richard Pan \nChairperson of the California Legislature's Asian Pacific Islander Caucus \nRichard Lim was walking along a quiet sidewalk near UC Berkeley's fraternity row last summer when, he said, two men called out to him. \n\"Hey Coronavirus, why don't you take yourself and go home,\" they shouted at the Asian American Studies graduate student, who was wearing a mask. \"You don't want to contaminate anyone.\" \nEven within his own family, the racist harassment Lim faced was not unique. His aunt, who works at an Asian supermarket, had also experienced racist verbal attacks, making her and Lim just two of thousands of Asian Americans who have reported experiencing harassment during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nLater that summer, with incidents on the rise, Lim decided to do something. He became a volunteer with Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition based in California that has recorded nearly 7,000 hate incidents involving Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders nationwide since the beginning of the pandemic and created reports based on their findings. Despite being a small volunteer organization, the group has in just over a year become a leading source for tracking incidents of hate in the country, and its work has been cited by dozens of media outlets including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, KQED, MSNBC and NBC News. \n\"Collecting the data and reporting on the data and getting in front of the media and other folks was really important,\" state Senator Richard Pan, who chairs the California Legislature's Asian Pacific Islander Caucus, said of the coalition's work. \"Without that collaboration, without that effort, I'm sure we would have individual stories, but they would not have highlighted this challenge that we're seeing.\" \nVolunteers like Lim say Stop AAPI Hate's impact has extended beyond publishing reports. \n\"We've grown to be more than just a data collection center,\" Lim said. \"We've become a foundation for grounding a movement.\" \nRussell Jeung, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, co-founded Stop AAPI Hate in March 2020 along with colleagues at two Asian- American advocacy organizations, Chinese for Affirmative Action's Cynthia Choi and the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council's Manjusha Kulkarni. \n\"I knew from Asian American history that when epidemics came from Asia, Asians would be blamed and then face racism,\" said Jeung. \"I quickly started documenting the racism.\" \nThe center soon received a number of grants from foundations, including one founded by professional basketball player Jeremy Lin, and gathered a group of volunteers and student researchers who could aid their mission. \nNearly a year later, the state of California pitched in, setting aside $1.4 million for the Stop AAPI Hate Coalition and UCLA's Asian American Studies Center to conduct research on hate crimes against Asian Americans. \nThe funding was championed by the Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus. \nWhile the FBI, the Department of Justice and California's Attorney General's Office collect data on hate crimes in California, no government agency was systematically tracking the recent uptick in harassment of Asian Americans, Pan said. \nVolunteers review each report submitted by community members to the Stop AAPI Hate website; more than 2,800 came in during March 2021 alone. Women reported more than two thirds of all incidents in the coalition's most recent national report. About 44% involved Chinese Americans. \nWhile about 12% of survivors said they experienced some form of physical assault, more than two-thirds reported verbal harassment. Others reported civil rights violations, such as workplace discrimination, or online attacks. \n\"When someone calls you a racial slur from a moving car, that's not something that you can necessarily call the police about. That's not violent. You are not physically hurt,\" said Chinese for Affirmative Action spokesperson Yamuna Hopwood. \"But it's hateful all the same.\" \nOnce received by the coalition, reports are entered into a database. If necessary, the report is then translated into English. Stop AAPI Hate does not verify the reports, Jeung said, but volunteers do \"clean up\" the data. \nThat involves editing reports for spelling and grammar, but also interpreting certain aspects of a case, such as determining what type of hate incident took place, said Eric Augustus Bai, a data engineer who helped Stop AAPI Hate develop new ways to visualize their data. \nAggregated data sets allow Stop AAPI Hate to track trends within anti-Asian racism, Jeung said. He stressed the importance of depicting racism as \"widespread, institutionalized and systemic.\" Recent reports from the coalition have analyzed the impact of racism on different Asian American ethnicities, on women and girls and on mental health. \nStop AAPI Hate may be new, but it's rooted in the work of people with years of experience focusing on Asian American issues, said Karin Wang, a professor of public interest law at UCLA and the former vice president of programs at Asian Americans Advancing Justice. \n\"In terms of what they were able to come together and do, I do think it's been really impactful,\" she said. \"I mean, we live in an age where data drives everything.\" \nBrian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at Cal State University, San Bernardino, said Stop AAPI Hate's findings line up with his own research, which focuses on crimes reported to police. Using police data, the center found that hate crimes against Asians in the U.S. increased by almost 200% between the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
