Why must we always be stereotyped as a foreigner?\"\nSheng L. Riechers, a senior communications specialist for the city of Appleton, noted that there is a broad range of people who identify as Asian Americans, from countries in extremely diverse regions of east Asia, southeast Asia and south Asia.\n\"As a Hmong American woman and as a Hmong Asian, I just wish that people took the time to learn more about Hmong people and our culture and our history and the reason why we're here in the U.S.,\" Riechers said. \"And just reminding them that the Hmong people, specifically, fought with U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War and that's why we're here. We're here as refugees of the Vietnam War.\"\nAddressing hate in the long term\nMoua said local Hmong leaders have been working with Appleton and Fox Valley leaders to make sure people are checking in on Asian businesses in the area and communicating more with Hmong community leaders.\nGreen Bay Police Cmdr. Kevin Warych said the police department will start holding community meetings with Asian American residents in Green Bay.\nWarych said the police department hasn't received any reports of hate incidents in the city, but Yang noted she has heard about incidents that went unreported.\nPeople rallied at \"Stop Asian hate\" marches and vigils held in Madison and Milwaukee as well as other states against racism, misogyny and xenophobia in the days after the shootings, seeking justice for the victims. Moua said the events are a way to vocalize the struggles so many Asian Americans face.\n\"Our culture and our community is a very silent community going back to trauma and keeping everything bottled in. We have to change that. We have to use our voice,\" she said.\nBut everyone can speak out on issues affecting Asian Americans and other marginalized groups, said Thai Xiong, the director of STEM and health and human performance at the Appleton school district and co-chair of N.E.W. Hmong Professionals.\n\"We are supporting each other because if other communities are willing to stand out with us, then we should be willing to stand up with them as well,\" he said.\nMai J. Lo Lee, diversity director at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay's Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs Office, noted people might make a social media post or correct a stranger's hateful or rude comment on the internet, but the hard part is holding conversations daily about hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\"I've been encouraging allies who identify as non-Asian to really reflect on the deficit that they themselves have as an individual and to be there for organization,\" Lee said.\nOne way to build support and understanding would be to ensure that young students are taught accurate histories of immigrants and other marginalized groups, Xiong said.\nLee suggested thinking about your excuses for lack of awareness. Take for example: \"Oh, I don't know about historical anti-Asian policies because my school never taught me,\" he said. Historical policies include immigration quotas enacted in 1924 that barred many Asians from immigrating to the U.S.\n\"Let's look at your current school district,\" Lee said. \"Let's look at curriculum and say, 'Let's not repeat that mistake.' So how can I educate my child, my niece, my nephew, myself on that? You're recognizing, 'I'm holding myself accountable about not knowing about anti-hate history because my school never taught me.' Well then, hold your school accountable. Hold your colleges accountable. This is where alumni voice is very important.\"\nThat same line of thinking can be applied to other parts of your life, Lee said. If you don't know know that many Asian American people in your workplace, question your workplace's hiring practices and policies. If you don't know have that many Asian American neighbors, ask yourself why that is? Is it that there are not many grocery stores and other businesses by and for Asian Americans in your community? How supportive is your community to minority-owned small businesses?\n\"Something I always challenge my friends and immediate family on: It's almost easier to correct a stranger, but how are you correcting family? How are you correcting colleagues? Your supervisor? The people you train? Because that's really where the work comes in, is that day-to-day,\" Lee said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPLETON<|>GEO<|>Appleton is a city where local Hmong leaders are working to support Asian businesses and community leaders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN BAY<|>GEO<|>Green Bay is a city where the police department is engaging with Asian American residents to address community issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADISON<|>GEO<|>Madison is a city where \"Stop Asian hate\" marches and vigils were held against racism and xenophobia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILWAUKEE<|>GEO<|>Milwaukee is a city where \"Stop Asian hate\" marches and vigils were held against racism and xenophobia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHENG L.
