The Pulitzer-winning author reflects on his own experiences as a Vietnamese American - and the dark history that continues to fuel the current hate \nOn 16 March eight people were killed in Atlanta, Georgia, by a 21-year-old white man: all but one were women, and six were Asian. The shootings take their place in a much longer story of anti-Asian violence. The Covid pandemic has given us a particular insight into this phenomenon: verbal and physical assaults against Asians have accelerated in the US over the last year, with involving - and. The majority of the victims have been women. \nThough took place in Asian massage parlours, the shooter has said he of their race. Instead, he claimed to be a sex addict bent on \"removing temptation\". Regardless of his denial - whether it is a lie or self-deception - it is obvious that he targeted these women because they were Asian. \"Racism and sexism intersect,\". This intersection has been a driving force in western attitudes towards Asia and Asian women, who are routinely hypersexualised and objectified in popular culture. \nEver since Puccini's 1904 opera Madame Butterfly, which inspired the hit 1989 musical Miss Saigon, Asians have been portrayed in romantic terms as self-sacrificing women who prefer white men to Asian men, and who willingly die for the love of white men. A more brutal version of this orientalist fantasy is found in many American movies about the war in Vietnam. Perhaps the most striking example isFull Metal Jacket of 1987. Young US Marines arriving in Vietnam are immediately greeted by a Vietnamese sex worker who sashays before them, saying: \"Me so horny.\" That line was turned into a massive hit by 2 Live Crew in 1989, and a generation of Asian American women would be subject to hearing it, along with \"me love you long time\", over and over. \nUnderneath the sexual objectification of Asian women lurks something much more threatening, as Kubrick made clear by the end of the movie, when the Marines are picked off by a sniper. When they finally capture the shooter, they discover she is a Vietnamese teenager. The movie condudes with the Marines surrounding her, and though only one of them pulls the trigger, it is clear this is a gang killing. The Asian woman, who began as a sexual temptation, ends as a mortal threat that must be eliminated by young men trained in boot camp to march with their rifles on their shoulders while they clutch at their crotches, : \"This is my rifle, this is my gun, this is for fighting, this is for fun.\" \nKubrick clearly understands that war, in the masculine imagination, is erotic. The novelist Larry Heinemann understood that, too. Reading his novel Close Quarters as a boy, I was shocked by a scene in which American soldiers gang-rape a Vietnamese sex worker whom they only call Claymore Face because of her acne scars. Immediately afterwards, the soldiers go to battle against their Vietnamese enemies. Heinemann wanted to disturb his readers because war, which he experienced as a combat soldier, is disturbing. In Close Quarters, idealistic young men go to war and become monsters. \nThe US is a colonising country. The difference is that Americans call their colonialism 'the American Dream' \nMy novel The Sympathizer is the story of \"a spy, a sleeper, a spook, a man of two faces\", whose task in 1975 as a communist agent is to flee with the remnants of the South Vietnamese army to the US and undermine efforts to recapture Vietnam. In writing it, I too wanted to question noble fantasies of heroism and war, to show that they are inseparable from cruelty and hatred - to force the reader to see what patriots and politicians too often deny. My aim was to attack an American exceptionalism that pretends that it has nothing to do with European-style colonialism. But the US is a colonising country. The difference is that Americans call their colonialism \"the American Dream\". \nSo when it comes to the American fetishisation of the Second Amendment, let's destroy the myth that the right to bear arms is simply about fighting off tyrants real or imagined. As I wrote in The Sympathizer, \"nothing was more American than wielding a gun and committing oneself to die for freedom and independence, unless it was wielding that gun to take away someone else's freedom and independence.\" How else to characterise the founding of the US, built on land stolen from Native peoples? \nBearing arms was crucial for European settlers in their violent colonisation of the so-called New World, and for American settlers as they conquered the west, all the way to California. According to the, American mythology casts white settler violence as \"regenerative”, versus the \"degenerative\" violence of Native peoples, enslaved black people, and their descendants. In this mythology, a black man with a gun is a threat, even if it is only a 12-year-old black boy with a toy gun, as in the case of. A white man with a gun - coloniser, settler, cowboy, soldier, or cop - is a hero. \nMy parents and I fled from the war-torn Vietnam depicted by Kubrick and came to the US, where it did not take long for us to encounter guns. My parents opened a Vietnamese grocery store in San Jose, California, in the late 1970s, where they were shot in their store one Christmas Eve. Flesh wounds, fortunately. A few years later, a gunman pushed his way into our house and pointed a gun in all our faces. I remember that the barrel was thin and long. My father and I did as we were told and knelt. My mother saved us all by running past the gunman\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ANTI-ASIAN RACISM<|>EVENT<|>Anti-Asian racism refers to the rise in hate crimes and discrimination against individuals of Asian descent, particularly highlighted during the Covid pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in Georgia where a mass shooting occurred, resulting in the deaths of eight individuals, six of whom were Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is a state in the United States where the city of Atlanta is located and where the mass shooting took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The Covid pandemic has been associated with a rise in anti-Asian violence and discrimination in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUCCINI<|>PERSON<|>Giacomo Puccini was an Italian composer known for his opera Madame Butterfly, which has influenced Western perceptions of Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADAME BUTTERFLY<|>EVENT<|>Madame Butterfly is a 1904 opera by Puccini that portrays Asian women in romanticized and self-sacrificing roles.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISS SAIGON<|>EVENT<|>Miss Saigon is a musical inspired by Puccini's Madame Butterfly, further perpetuating stereotypes about Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FULL METAL JACKET<|>EVENT<|>Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 film directed by Stanley Kubrick that depicts the Vietnam War and includes themes of sexual objectification of Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARRY HEINEMANN<|>PERSON<|>Larry Heinemann is an American novelist known for his book Close Quarters, which explores the disturbing realities of war and its impact on soldiers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOSE QUARTERS<|>EVENT<|>Close Quarters is a novel by Larry Heinemann that depicts American soldiers' experiences in Vietnam, including themes of violence and sexual exploitation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SYMPATHIZER<|>EVENT<|>The Sympathizer is a novel that tells the story of a communist agent fleeing Vietnam and critiques American exceptionalism and colonialism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN JOSE<|>GEO<|>San Jose is a city in California where the author's parents opened a Vietnamese grocery store after fleeing Vietnam.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIETNAM<|>GEO<|>Vietnam is the country from which the author and their family fled due to the war, depicted in films like Full Metal Jacket.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>ANTI-ASIAN RACISM<|>The mass shooting in Atlanta is a significant event that highlights the issue of anti-Asian racism in the United States.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGIA<|>ANTI-ASIAN RACISM<|>The state of Georgia is where the mass shooting occurred, contributing to the broader context of anti-Asian violence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID PANDEMIC<|>ANTI-ASIAN RACISM<|>The Covid pandemic has been linked to an increase in anti-Asian racism and violence, as noted in the text.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUCCINI<|>MADAME BUTTERFLY<|>Puccini is the composer of Madame Butterfly, which has influenced Western portrayals of Asian women.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MADAME BUTTERFLY<|>MISS SAIGON<|>Miss Saigon is inspired by Madame Butterfly, continuing the narrative of Asian women in romanticized roles.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FULL METAL JACKET<|>VIETNAM<|>Full Metal Jacket depicts the Vietnam War, a significant historical context for the author's experiences and reflections.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARRY HEINEMANN<|>CLOSE QUARTERS<|>Larry Heinemann is the author of Close Quarters, which explores the disturbing realities of war, similar to themes in Full Metal Jacket.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE SYMPATHIZER<|>VIETNAM<|>The Sympathizer is set against the backdrop of Vietnam and critiques American colonialism and exceptionalism.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN JOSE<|>VIETNAM<|>San Jose is where the author's family settled after fleeing Vietnam, linking their personal history to the broader narrative of immigration and violence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
