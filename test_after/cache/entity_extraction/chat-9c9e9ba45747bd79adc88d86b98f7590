Shum said her lone White employee volunteered to dispose of the carcass, aware of the implications of an Asian American being seen discarding the animal.\n\"All of us knew what it meant and understood the gravity of the situation. This was a very obvious hate crime,\" Shum said.\nWhen she posted about the incident on social media, Shum was aghast that some users defended the man who left the cat. \"People were like, 'Don't you guys do that? Don't you guys butcher up cats and dogs? Maybe he was on to something?' \" she said.\nShum said that even when police arrived to take a report of the incident, one officer questioned why she considered it a hate crime. The perpetrator was not arrested, but Shum said he called the shop to apologize after seeing surveillance video of himself on the news and said he was \"having a bad day.\"\n\"It's domestic terrorism,\" she said.\nKarl Chan, a Sacramento police spokesman, said the case remains open and detectives are investigating it as a hate crime.\n\"In order for a crime to fall under the definition of a bias or hate related incident a distinction must be made that the crime/incident was motivated by bias,\" Chan said in a written statement. \"One of the ways that officers can make this distinction during the preliminary investigation is by asking questions that would identify how the victim perceived the crime or incident.\"\nShum, a former Los Angeles television producer and marketing manager, had returned to Sacramento in late 2019 to take over the butcher shop from her parents, immigrants who came from China in the 1980s. She had grand promotion plans for the store, which serves a predominantly low-income community. She built a website and started online orders and deliveries, to make the shop more accessible.\n\"We're now hiding and not promoting in a way that we want to or used to,\" Shum said. \"That is so detrimental to us, but we're scared of people finding out who we are.\"\nShum has removed most of her mother's Chinese brush paintings and other cultural decor to make the business appear \"less Asian.\" She stopped marketing the business on social media with photos of a cat figurine waving one paw, a common symbol that Asian-owned businesses display to bring good luck.\n\"You have to minimize yourself in hopes that nobody notices you and attacks you,\" she said. \"It's such a miserable half-existence.\"\nLast weekend, in the wake of the Atlanta attacks, Shum thought about hiring extra security to check for weapons at the door. But she could not afford it.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
