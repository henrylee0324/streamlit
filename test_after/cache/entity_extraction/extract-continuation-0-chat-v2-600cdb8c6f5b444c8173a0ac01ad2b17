Then I have to remind myself that actually, they made a life here on their own, so they're much more resilient,\" she said. \"My parents are much more strong than I give them credit for.\" \nWhenever Thao Lee hears about a mass shooting, she worries for her three children, who are spread out across the country from Alaska to D.C. Nowadays, with a pandemic and reports that Asians across the country are being harassed, she worries even more. \nLee is a refugee from Laos, who settled in Spokane, Wash., in 1985 at 16 years old. She and her husband gave their children both Hmong names and American names, and they have a close, huge family. Word spreads fast, especially through Lee's mother, an avid listener of Hmong radio who calls her grandchildren individually whenever she hears of a crisis. \nThe day of the shooting, the multiple family text and Facebook messaging chains went into overdrive as relatives checked in on one another, sharing tips on how to stay safe and urging vigilance. \nLee's daughter, who goes by Monica, said it felt like the shooting validated a growing fear among her family and Asian American friends. \n\"Leading up to the shooting, all of these anti-Asian hate incidents were happening to our elders, right. And so I think just when the shooting happened in Atlanta, it just compounded all the feelings that I think we were sort of suppressing at that time or didn't really know how to process yet,\" Monica said. \nFor Thao, the shooting reinforced her feeling of vulnerability during the pandemic. The shooting could have happened anywhere, she said. \n\"It could be me, it could be any of my children or anybody who is Asian now that because of all this going on. Even when I go to the store, I have to watch my back all the time. If I have to sneeze or cough, I really have to look around to see who is around me, what are they going to act or how are they going to look at me,\" Thao said. \nThe Asian diaspora in America is diverse, including when it comes to socioeconomics. Hmong Americans tend to experience more poverty than many other Asian American \ngroups. \n\"We all know of women who work in these sort of working jobs,\" Monica said. \"Being Hmong American also means that oftentimes we come from low-income working- class backgrounds.\" \nThat includes her mother and her aunts, who took cleaning jobs at office buildings on the weekends to earn extra income for their families. \n\"I mean, that's exactly what our parents do, right? Especially immigrant Asian parents who will work double time, or work two or three jobs no matter how hard it is,\" Monica said, \"just to make sure that their kids have better comfortable lives than they did.\" \nMonica said the shooting made her wonder about the support and connections society provides to those who are often overlooked, especially people who work in lower- wage jobs and have limited language capabilities. \n\"I always think about that like, you know, I love how these GoFundMe's came to be. But on the flip side, it just it sucks that, like, why couldn't we have helped these people beforehand?\" Monica said. \"Why were they subjected to these positions, and I guess their position in society, before the shooting happened?\" \nKim moved to America from South Korea in 1999 as an eighth-grader, eventually settling in with a host family in Anchorage. After attending college in Montana, she moved back to Anchorage to start working. But after her work permit fell through, she was no longer eligible to stay in the United States. \nShe was in her early 20s at the time and didn't have enough money to buy a ticket back home to Korea, she said. So she overstayed her visa. \nShe worked several jobs, including waitressing, and earned so little she could barely afford housing. Then she found out she was pregnant. \n\"When I was pregnant, I almost became homeless because I didn't have any money and it was hard. I thought about going to homeless women's shelter and things like that, but I didn't want to risk myself,\" she said. \nInstead, she applied for protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants legal status to some people who entered the country as children and are unlawfully present. Even going to the hospital during her pregnancy made her fear deportation. \nBut she was approved and has been renewing with the program every two years since. She now works for a government agency and raises her 5-year-old son as a single mother. \n\"I've come from basically zero to here. I am very thankful,\" she said. \nKim constantly fears losing all that she worked for, including her ability to take care of her son. \n\"In a sense I felt like, 'What if I was in a supermarket, or I was in the spa, and someone came in with a gun? Am I able to take care of my child if I were that person? What is going to happen to my child?' I [read about] this one lady who had two boys. The two boys said how great of a mom she was, how she was trying really, really hard. My heart ached.\" \nWhen she saw that another victim was a Korean mother of mixed-race children, she saw in them herself and her own mixed-race son. \n\"I felt really bad for her sons, because my son is also half Korean, half White. And I know that her sons, both of her sons were mixed race, and I just somehow put myself into her position.
