This stereotype associates different minorities and people with externalized national threats to the U.S., like the trade war with China, Louie said. \nIn his speech at the vigil, David Kim also described the perpetual foreigner stereotype and how it has been a hallmark of the Asian American experience since the arrival of Asians in the U.S. \n\"As 'perpetual foreigners,' regardless of our individual places in the U.S., it has meant that our experiences and our racial injury haven't really mattered,\" he said. \nIn addition to divisive rhetoric, sexualized and submissive stereotypes of Asian women have been linked to increasing rates of violence in the past, according to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. \nLouie stressed the importance of education in order to help curb anti-Asian violence and discrimination in the future. Asian American studies in higher education, K-12 education and community-based programs are essential to move forward, Louie said. \n\"That's something we can definitely do, but we can't do it if it's not on the radar screen,\" she said. \"This is a moment of dialogue, learning and coalition building. That's how change happens.\" \nThe vigil was put together soon after the shootings by local community leaders, Julissa Coriano, April Pags and David Kim. \nToward the end of the vigil, the power in the church went out due to a thunderstorm, but the stories continued. Attendees raised the flashlights on their phones to illuminate the remainder of the event and the voices behind it. \n\"The vigil happened because of so many reasons,\" Coriano said. \"Not only to honor the victims, not only to bring forward a bigger conversation about solidarity against all forms of racism, but to validate the long history of pain and hurt this beautiful community has experienced.\" \nContact the reporter at jcastaneda1@ delawareonline.com or connect with him on Twitter @joseicastaneda. \n\"We will not be silent.
