Gary Locke (D), the country's first Asian American governor, spoke at the rally and\ncalled for an end to violence against Asian American communities.\nThis violence against Asian Americans, and especially our elderly, has got to stop, Locke said, adding, We cannot\nscapegoat, blame Asian Americans for this virus. Hate is a virus.\nAt the event, King County Executive Dow Constantine, who is married to a Japanese American woman, declared\nthat he will propose substantial funding for the education and publicity to address racially based hate and bias in\nour community in the upcoming budget.\nNoriko Nasu, a Japanese American teacher who was attacked along with her boyfriend close to Hing Hay Park\nlast month, addressed the demonstrators wearing the same outfit she wore during the assault.\nShe called on authorities to take hate crime more seriously and take more action, according to Seattle station\nKOMO 4 TV.\n\"I don't think the statute or the law is well-written to protect the people and I want hate crime charges to be\nheavier, she said.\nKing County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg wrote last week that the two counts of felony assault against the\nsuspect in the case, Sean Holdip, would lead to a longer punishment of 12 to 14 months than a hate crime\ncharge. He noted that the current evidence collected did not seem to be enough to prove a hate crime.\nWe are ethically bound to only bring cases that we believe can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, he wrote,\nadding, We're open to changing the charge if additional evidence is found or if the suspect makes additional\nstatements.\nThe rally came as a report released last week concluded that Asian Americans saw a 150 percent increase in\nattacks in 2020.\nPresident Joe Biden denounced the rise in violence against Asian Americans in an address last week saying, It's\nwrong, it's un-American and it must stop. - FNA\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
