Another woman was punched and bombarded with racial comments in a park. \nOn a bus in Eagle Rock, an attacker apparently mistook an elderly Latina woman for Asian, calling her an anti-Chinese slur before reportedly pulling her hair and breaking her nose. \nSeemingly bothered by the drumbeat of hate, a Korean man in Orange County allegedly kidnapped a woman he thought was white but who turned out to be Asian. \nExperts said an increase in anti-Asian attacks began in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified, with the attacks spiking sharply in recent months. \nSome attackers have seized on the virus' Chinese origins to erroneously blame Asian Americans for the pandemic. \nLaw enforcement officials have said a shooting rampage at spas in the Atlanta area that left eight people dead, including six Asian women, did not appear to be motivated by racial bias. But for many Asian Americans, the massacre last month by a 21-year-old white man was the culmination of a year of anti-Asian hatred. \n\"This has been with us for at least a solid year and likely to be much longer,\" said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate. \nFrom March 2020 to February, nearly 3,800 attacks against Asian Americans nationwide were reported to Stop AAPI Hate. A report by the group that will be released within weeks shows a \"significant increase\" in anti-Asian attacks in the last year, Kulkarni said. \n\"Really, that's just the tip of the iceberg through February,\" she said. \nInitially, many of the attacks that gained widespread media attention were violent assaults against elderly Asian pedestrians for which authorities did not determine a motive because the attacker did not say anything racist. \nOther attacks have included racial slurs, sometimes accompanied by physical assaults. \nOn Tuesday, a man followed an Asian woman into her garage, shouted racial insults and spat in her face, El Cerrito Police Lt. Lauren Caputo said. \nThe man, Ricky Amos, 56, was described as homeless and did not know the victim, Caputo said. \nAmos was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of battery and vandalism with a hate crime enhancement. He also faces charges of violating sex offender registration requirements. \nIn Tustin on Sunday morning, an 18-year-old Korean American woman was preparing to teach a private art lesson in Veterans Sports Park when a man approached her and made comments about her appearance, according to the Orange County Register. \n\"When I said I'm Korean, it was like he got excited,\" the woman, Jenna Dupuy, told the Register. \nAbout an hour later, the man returned and grew increasingly threatening, with several parkgoers asking him to leave. \n\"The suspect made racial comments and punched her in the stomach,\" Lt. Stephanie Nichols of the Tustin Police Department said in a statement. \nDupuy pepper-sprayed the man, and he fled the scene before officers arrived. \nJauhar Tajuddin Shuaib, 42, of Irvine was arrested on suspicion of a hate crime, assault, sexually motivated annoyance, abusive language and other offenses, Nichols said. \nDupuy said she suffered a concussion and fractured shoulder, among other injuries. \nCalling it a \"horrific incident,\" Tustin Mayor Letitia Clark said the city will not tolerate bigotry or racism. \n\"I am profoundly disturbed by both the rise in hate crimes directed at our Asian American and Pacific Islander neighbors across the county and the recent incident in Veterans Sports Park,\" Clark said in a statement. \"As a community, we cannot be silent about these crimes.\" \nThe city is creating a hotline for reporting hate crimes, she said, and will be offering a self-defense class in the near future. \nIn Eagle Rock, a 70-year-old Mexican American woman was reportedly attacked Friday while trying to get off a Metro bus. Witnesses said the attacker used an anti- Chinese slur against the woman before assaulting her. \nThe woman's nose was broken and her hair was pulled, her son told the Eastsider, adding that his family members are often mistaken for Asian. \nYasmine Beasley, 23, was arrested on suspicion of felony battery, said Officer William Cooper, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. Cooper said he did not know whether prosecutors were pursuing hate crime charges. \nIn a statement about the incident, Metro expressed condolences to victims of hate crimes on the transit system and said it has a zero-tolerance policy for violence against customers or employees. \n\"We strongly condemn any offenses done in the name of race, religion, sex or national origin,\" the agency said. \nExperts say the rise in hate crimes is linked to anti-Asian rhetoric arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, then-President Trump called the coronavirus \"the Chinese virus\" and \"kung flu.\" \n\"Trump's role in exacerbating and igniting this firestorm can't be denied,\" said Karen Umemoto, director of the Asian American Studies Center at UCLA, noting that a recent study found a significant increase in anti-Asian hashtags in the week after Trump tweeted about \"the Chinese virus.\" \nStop AAPI Hate and other organizations are pushing for improvements in education, data collection and legislation, including a civil rights infrastructure that would allow people to report hate incidents and have more access to victims' resources. \nIn what police described as an attempt to retaliate for hate crimes against Asians, a man in Lake Forest kidnapped a woman, held her at gunpoint in her car and groped her. \nWhen the victim yelled to a nearby maintenance worker for\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a U.S. state experiencing a recent increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, including verbal and physical assaults.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAGLE ROCK<|>GEO<|>Eagle Rock is a neighborhood in California where an elderly Latina woman was attacked with anti-Asian slurs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Orange County is a region in California where a Korean man allegedly kidnapped a woman he mistook for white.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city where a shooting rampage at spas occurred, resulting in the deaths of eight people, including six Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANJUSHA KULKARNI<|>PERSON<|>Manjusha Kulkarni is the executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that tracks and reports incidents of anti-Asian hate and advocates for policy changes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENNA DUPUY<|>PERSON<|>Jenna Dupuy is an 18-year-old Korean American woman who was attacked while preparing to teach an art lesson in Veterans Sports Park.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETITIA CLARK<|>PERSON<|>Letitia Clark is the mayor of Tustin, California, who condemned the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICKY AMOS<|>PERSON<|>Ricky Amos is a 56-year-old man arrested for battery and vandalism with a hate crime enhancement after attacking an Asian woman.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAUHAR TAJUDDIN SHUAIB<|>PERSON<|>Jauhar Tajuddin Shuaib is a 42-year-old man arrested on suspicion of a hate crime and other offenses in Irvine.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YASMINE BEASLEY<|>PERSON<|>Yasmine Beasley is a 23-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of felony battery after attacking a 70-year-old Mexican American woman.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICKY AMOS<|>JENNA DUPUY<|>Ricky Amos attacked an Asian woman, which is part of the broader context of rising anti-Asian hate crimes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETITIA CLARK<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Letitia Clark's condemnation of hate crimes aligns with the mission of Stop AAPI Hate to address anti-Asian violence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANJUSHA KULKARNI<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Manjusha Kulkarni is a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks anti-Asian hate incidents<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JENNA DUPUY<|>LETITIA CLARK<|>Jenna Dupuy's experience of being attacked highlights the issues that Letitia Clark is addressing in her statements<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YASMINE BEASLEY<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Yasmine Beasley's arrest for battery is part of the ongoing issue of hate crimes in California<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAUHAR TAJUDDIN SHUAIB<|>ORANGE COUNTY<|>Jauhar Tajuddin Shuaib was arrested in Orange County for a hate crime, contributing to the area's rising violence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAGLE ROCK<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Eagle Rock is a neighborhood in California where anti-Asian hate crimes have been reported<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>CALIFORNIA<|>The shooting rampage in Atlanta is part of the national context of rising anti-Asian hate crimes, affecting communities across the U.S.<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
