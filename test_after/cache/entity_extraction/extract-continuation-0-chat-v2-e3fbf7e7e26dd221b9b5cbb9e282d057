And yet not surprised because of increasingly racist rhetoric against Asian Americans locally and across the country since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\"There's a lot of fear, uncertainty, sadness that this is happening when times are already especially tough. We've dealt with a year of anti-Asian racism and xenophobia because of the virus,\" Chann said. \"We've been going about our days differently, whether it's grocery shopping or going around town or driving or waiting in a parking lot. There's always that fear that something might happen.\"\nPortland police say an agitated white man may have committed a hate crime on Monday when he yelled \"go back to where you came from\" at an Asian American woman before kicking a side mirror off her car. The woman, who was with her young children when she was accosted outside of an oil change business on Forest Avenue, recorded the incident and reported it to police.\nPolice identified Troy Sprague, 47, as the suspect. Sprague, who police say is homeless, is facing a charge of criminal mischief as police continue to investigate the incident as a possible hate crime.\nSprague was not arrested or issued a summons because he was acting \"manic\" and not wearing a mask and ran away from police, said David Singer, a spokesman for the department. Officers will monitor Sprague and issue the summons the next time they come in contact with him, he said.\n'This is nothing new to us'\nMembers of Asian American communities in Portland say the incident has caused widespread fear, with some people afraid to go to the grocery store or to let their children travel to and from school. Since the Portland incident was reported, the leadership of United Asian Communities, a group formed during the pandemic to unite and support those communities in Maine, has been taking calls from people who talk about only going to the store in groups.\nAsian Americans have experienced harassment and micro-aggressions for years, ranging from laws that prohibited immigrants from China in the 1880s to internment of Japanese Americans during World War II to people telling Asian Americans to \"go home.\" Asian Americans are the third most targeted ethnic or racial group after African Americans and Jewish Americans, said Amy Chea, the secretary and chief strategy officer for UAC.\n\"This is nothing new to us,\" said Chan Himm, president and CEO of United Asian Communities. \"Your heart is broken and it's hurt because of what just happened in our community. To continuously try to calm them and let them know they are safe and secure, that's a hard conversation to have.\"\nPortland's mayor and city councilors issued written statements denouncing the incident on Monday, labeling it as a hate crime. All said the city of Portland is a welcoming community that does not tolerate hate.\n\"We will continue to work to make Portland a city that welcomes everyone and creates a secured community with a sense of belonging and inclusiveness for all and we stand united against hate,\" Mayor Kate Snyder said.\nCouncilor Tae Chong, who is Asian American, cited the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes around the country and said it was unsettling that it happened to a family in Portland.\n\"Our community is only as good as how safe everyone feels,\" Chong said. \"Hate has no place in our community, where we all call Portland home.\"\nSuch incidents that involve violence are relatively rare in Maine, but similar reports of violence and harassment targeting Asian Americans have surged nationally during the pandemic, fueled by rhetoric blaming the coronavirus on China or Asian Americans. While in office, former President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the \"kung flu\" and \"China virus.\"\nspike in anti-asian hate crimes\nThe Stop AAPI Hate reporting center has recorded 3,795 incidents targeting Asian American and Pacific Islanders between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28. Most of the incidents have been aimed at women, and range from verbal harassment to physical assaults. A recent report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism said anti-Asian hate crimes increased 149 percent in American's largest cities last year.\nOn Tuesday, eight people - six of whom were Asian - were shot to death at three Atlanta-area massage parlors, raising further alarm about hate crimes against people of Asian descent. Police in major cities had already ramped up security in some neighborhoods following violent attacks on Asian Americans in the past year.\nPolice in Portland have not been receiving more reports of crimes against Asian Americans. In the past year, Asian Americans were victims of three assaults or other violent crimes in the city, but it is not known if race was a factor in those cases, Singer said.\n\"To be the target of such a racist and hate-induced crime cuts directly against everything we stand for in the city of Portland,\" police Chief Frank Clark said on Tuesday of the attack on Forest Avenue.\nAn estimated 1.3 percent of Maine's 1.3 million residents, or roughly 17,000 people, are of Asian descent, according to the U.S. Census. That does not include people who identify with two or more races.\nFBI data published by the Anti-Defamation League shows 19 reports of hate crimes in Maine in 2019, one fewer than 2018. Of the 19 incidents in 2019, 10 involved race, although races are not broken down. Seven incidents involved sexual orientation and two involved religion.\nFBI hate crime data is not available for 2020, but the ADL lists 19 incidents last year in Maine that did not rise to the level of a crime, up\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MARPHEN CHANN<|>PERSON<|>Marphen Chann is a resident of Portland who expressed surprise and concern over a racially motivated attack against an Asian American woman in his community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORTLAND<|>GEO<|>Portland is a city in Maine known for its welcoming atmosphere and progressive stance on issues like LGBTQ rights, but it has recently faced incidents of racial violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TROY SPRAGUE<|>PERSON<|>Troy Sprague is a 47-year-old suspect identified by police in a racially motivated attack against an Asian American woman in Portland.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED ASIAN COMMUNITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>United Asian Communities is a group formed during the pandemic to unite and support Asian American communities in Maine.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATE SNYDER<|>PERSON<|>Kate Snyder is the mayor of Portland who issued a statement denouncing the racially motivated attack.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAE CHONG<|>PERSON<|>Tae Chong is a city councilor in Portland and an Asian American who commented on the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a reporting center that tracks incidents of hate against Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism conducts research and reports on hate crimes, including those targeting Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAINE<|>GEO<|>Maine is a state in the United States where Portland is located, and it has a small population of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARPHEN CHANN<|>PORTLAND<|>Marphen Chann is a resident of Portland and expressed his feelings about the racially motivated attack that occurred in the city<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TROY SPRAGUE<|>PORTLAND<|>Troy Sprague is the suspect in a racially motivated attack that took place in Portland<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED ASIAN COMMUNITIES<|>PORTLAND<|>United Asian Communities is actively supporting Asian American communities in Portland following the racially motivated attack<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATE SNYDER<|>PORTLAND<|>Kate Snyder, as the mayor of Portland, issued a statement regarding the racially motivated attack in her city<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAE CHONG<|>PORTLAND<|>Tae Chong, as a city councilor in Portland, commented on the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes in the city<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>UNITED ASIAN COMMUNITIES<|>Stop AAPI Hate and United Asian Communities both focus on addressing and reporting incidents of hate against Asian Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism provides research that informs the work of Stop AAPI Hate<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAINE<|>PORTLAND<|>Portland is a city located in the state of Maine, which has a small population of Asian descent<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
