Aashka Raval, co-president of United Asian Advocates, told The Enquirer the group had been in discussions about the demands before that, when an adjunct instructor referred to COVID-19 as \"the Chinese virus\" in an email to a student. UC did not renew its contract with John Ucker for the spring semester after investigating the incident. \nAt least two people unmuted themselves during the February Zoom panel and started \"spewing hate\" more than 40 minutes into the event, Raval said. One of the disruptors called a member of the United Asian Advocates a \"cow\" and told her to \"go back to India.\" \n\"I want to commend (United Asian Advocates) for speaking out on the rising levels of violence, discrimination and xenophobia directed at Asians and Asian Americans across the nation,\" Pinto, who was born in Mumbai, India, said. \"I stand with them in denouncing the bigoted comments made by unwelcomed visitors to their virtual meeting earlier this semester. Such disturbing examples of hate and racism cannot be tolerated.\" \nOf the nearly 36,000 undergraduate students enrolled at UC in the 2020-2021 school year, 4.7% identify as Asian and 6.4% identify as international, according to the university's website. \nPinto met with the student organization on Thursday. In a message to The Enquirer Friday morning, Raval said she thought it was \"productive.\" \nIn his Thursday statement, Pinto said he looks forward to partnering with United Asian Advocates and other supporters across campus moving forward. \n\"As an academic community, we must strive every single day to create a truly diverse, inclusive, equitable, safe and supportive environment,\" Pinto said. \nThe United Asian Advocates' demands are detailed on their website and summarized below: \nA no-tolerance video or written statement from Pinto addressing xenophobic and racist incidents against Asian identifying people on campus and beyond. \nImplementation of a universitywide bias reporting tool moderated by the office of equity and inclusion, based on the current system through the College of Arts and Sciences. The tool must be highlighted in the syllabus and at student orientations. \nRecruit, hire and retain a staff member with experience supporting Asian-identifying students and organizations for the Office of Ethnic Programs and Services. \nRecruit, hire and retain at least one qualified individual with experience working with Asian mental health care and racial trauma at the UC Counseling and Psychological Services. \nDevelop mandatory anti-racism training, similar to the alcohol awareness and sexual harassment training currently required by the university, for incoming university first- year students. \nInclude a Multicultural Center in the Next Lives Here expansion plans to highlight, support and empower all marginalized racial, ethnic and cultural identities at UC.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Cincinnati is an academic institution where students are advocating against anti-Asian racism and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEVILLE PINTO<|>PERSON<|>Neville Pinto is the president of the University of Cincinnati, who supports the United Asian Advocates and addresses issues of racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED ASIAN ADVOCATES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>United Asian Advocates is a student group at the University of Cincinnati advocating against anti-Asian racism and promoting inclusivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AASHKA RAVAL<|>PERSON<|>Aashka Raval is the co-president of United Asian Advocates, involved in discussions about demands for the university.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN UCKER<|>PERSON<|>John Ucker is an adjunct instructor at the University of Cincinnati whose contract was not renewed after an incident involving a racist comment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEBRUARY 23<|>EVENT<|>The event on February 23 was a virtual Asian leadership panel that was disrupted by hate speech during a Zoom meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUMBAI<|>GEO<|>Mumbai is the city in India where Neville Pinto was born.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEVILLE PINTO<|>UNITED ASIAN ADVOCATES<|>Neville Pinto supports the United Asian Advocates in their fight against racism and has met with them to discuss their demands<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AASHKA RAVAL<|>UNITED ASIAN ADVOCATES<|>Aashka Raval is the co-president of United Asian Advocates and plays a key role in the organization<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN UCKER<|>UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI<|>John Ucker's contract was not renewed by the University of Cincinnati following an investigation into his racist comments<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEBRUARY 23<|>UNITED ASIAN ADVOCATES<|>The United Asian Advocates were involved in a virtual panel event on February 23 that was disrupted by hate speech<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUMBAI<|>NEVILLE PINTO<|>Neville Pinto was born in Mumbai, India, which is relevant to his identity and perspective on racism<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
