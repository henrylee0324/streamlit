It should never be the case in this county that you should walk out and worry about doing something to you just because of who you are. That's terrible.\"\nOn Sunday, Kentucky's only Asian-American legislator, Rep. Nima Kulkarni, will lead a 6 p.m. vigil in Louisville with interfaith and Asian groups in Louisville's Waterfront Park, joining vigils in Georgia, Illinois and New York.\nWhile police are still investigating the motive for the shooting at several Georgia spas, and whether racism was involved, it has nonetheless put a national spotlight on the toxic stew of racism, xenophobia, and misogyny faced by many Asian-American women.\n\"We need to encourage as much solidarity as possible,\" Kulkarni said, while also finding ways to better identify and halt anti-Asian incidents.\nThe rise of such incidents has come amid the coronavirus pandemic, which former President Donald Trump blamed on China. He has referred to COVID-19 as the \"China Virus\" and the \"kung flu.\"\nFrom March 2020 to February 2021, Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, received 3,800 reports of anti-Asian hate, with women reporting hate incidents 2.3 times more than men.\nThe report only ranked the top 18 states for such incidents, which did not include Kentucky or Indiana.\nNeither the Louisville Metro Police nor the Lexington Police responded when The Courier Journal asked whether they had seen any reports or upticks in harassment or assaults against Asian Americans.\nCatholic Charities migration and refugee officials, who serve residents from Asian countries around the world living in Louisville, said they haven't heard of any instances of violence.\nSome incidents that don't rise to the level of assault, such as verbal or online harassment or vandalism, and are likely not being reported, Kulkarni said.\n\"We'd like to see politicians and police to take steps to prevent this from happening,\" said Wang, who said his group has urged members to be cautious as they go about their day, including simply going shopping.\n\"It's just crazy we have to be doing that,\" he said.\nHe blamed political \"scapegoating\" for fueling anti-Asian sentiment but said it only tapped into an \"age-old problem\" of discrimination toward Asians in the United States.\nThe Pew Research Center reported last year that 31% of Asian adults surveyed said they were the target of racial slurs or jokes since the pandemic began. On Twitter, the hashtag #StopAsianHate has led many to share experiences of discrimination.\nDan Wu, the Asian-American owner of Atomic Ramen in Lexington, recently wrote in the Lexington Herald-Leader of the daily \"small acts of casual racism encountered by folks like me.\"\nReporter Chris Kenning can be reached at ckenning@gannett.com or folllow on Twitter @chris_kenning\nIf you go\nKentucky Rep. Nima Kulkarni will lead a 6 p.m. vigil Sunday in Louisville with interfaith and Asian groups in Louisville's Waterfront Park to confront violence against Asian Americans.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KENTUCKY CHINESE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group advocating for the safety and rights of Chinese Americans in Kentucky, urging political leaders to denounce anti-Asian harassment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANGZHENG WANG<|>PERSON<|>Leader of the Kentucky Chinese American Association, expressing concerns about the safety of Asian Americans in Kentucky.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIMA KULKARNI<|>PERSON<|>Kentucky's only Asian-American legislator, leading a vigil in Louisville to address violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOUISVILLE<|>GEO<|>The largest city in Kentucky, where a vigil is being held to confront violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATERFRONT PARK<|>GEO<|>A park in Louisville where the vigil led by Nima Kulkarni will take place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA MASS SHOOTING<|>EVENT<|>A tragic incident where six Asian women were killed, raising fears and concerns among Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group that tracks discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, reporting thousands of incidents of anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Former President of the United States, who referred to COVID-19 using terms that have been criticized for fueling anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>A global pandemic that has been associated with increased discrimination against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATOMIC RAMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A restaurant in Lexington owned by an Asian-American, highlighting experiences of casual racism.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHANGZHENG WANG<|>KENTUCKY CHINESE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION<|>Changzheng Wang is the leader of the Kentucky Chinese American Association, advocating for the safety of Asian Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NIMA KULKARNI<|>LOUISVILLE<|>Nima Kulkarni is leading a vigil in Louisville to address violence against Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NIMA KULKARNI<|>WATERFRONT PARK<|>Nima Kulkarni will lead a vigil at Waterfront Park in Louisville<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA MASS SHOOTING<|>KENTUCKY CHINESE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION<|>The Atlanta mass shooting has raised concerns for the Kentucky Chinese American Association<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>KENTUCKY CHINESE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate tracks incidents of discrimination that the Kentucky Chinese American Association is concerned about<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>COVID-19<|>Donald Trump referred to COVID-19 in a way that has been criticized for increasing anti-Asian sentiment<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NIMA KULKARNI<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Nima Kulkarni is addressing the rise in anti-Asian incidents tracked by Stop AAPI Hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHANGZHENG WANG<|>KENTUCKY CHINESE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION<|>Changzheng Wang is urging members of the Kentucky Chinese American Association to be cautious<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATOMIC RAMEN<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Atomic Ramen's owner has expressed experiences of racism that have been exacerbated by rhetoric from Donald Trump<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
