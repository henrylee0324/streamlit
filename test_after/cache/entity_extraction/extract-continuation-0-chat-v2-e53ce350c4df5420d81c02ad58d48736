Ch*nk.\" \nJust this past March, a woman hit an Asian passenger across the face without provocation and then began yelling racial slurs. \nThe following month, a man spit on an Asian woman and her three children. \nThen a drunk man tried to push an Asian woman onto the subway tracks in Brooklyn before being stopped. \nAll three of those incidents happened in the New York Subway system. \nRecently, Mayor Bill De Blasio pledged to focus subway patrols on bias crimes, according to the New York Times. \nCrisanna Tang told the Times said that in July a maskless man spit on her and told her to go back to China. \nShe says she now pays to take the more expensive express bus rather than to ride on a subway and risk her own safety. \n\"I just wish these incidents would stop,\" Tang said. \"I am worried about the elderly community. I am really worried not enough is being done for them.\" \nThis past April, protesters took the subway system to loudly express their concern and to distribute safety messages to passengers recently. \n\"We are outraged that Asian Americans are being attacked both above and below ground. And to make matters worse, bystanders are watching us get attacked with complete indifference. This is absolutely unacceptable! Asian American are human beings, and we should be treated as such. That is why we are protesting and why we are giving our fellow New Yorkers the push- and the tools they need to become better upstanders for everyone in our city,\" Barbara Yau, who co- founded the group Concerned Asian American Citizens of New York City with Shirley L.
