They pointed to the case of University of Kansas researcher Franklin Tao, a permanent U.S. resident who was indicted in 2019 and accused of failing to disclose an alleged teaching contract with a Chinese university while conducting federally funded research. His lawyers have denied the charges. \n\"Publicly available information suggests at least 60 cases that have been filed had a reference to the China Initiative. Only a quarter of them have actually involved charges of espionage,\" said John C. Yang, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which has advocated on behalf of Tao, whose case is pending. Yang's organization has asked the Biden administration to put a moratorium on the program and conduct a review of it.\n\"This goes to the perpetual foreigner stereotype we always talk about,\" Yang said, \"where in various points in history, we are targeted unfairly.\"\nJustice Department officials met with Asian American advocates two weeks ago, but they declined to comment on the future of that program. They have pledged to develop new grant programs for local police agencies to report on hate crime data and efforts to translate federal hate crime reporting portals into Chinese and other Asian languages.\nAt her confirmation hearing last week, Lisa Monaco, Biden's nominee for deputy attorney general, offered credit to the Trump administration for focusing on cyberthreats from China and said she expects to \"double down\" on the strategy. \"This is an area I think we have a great deal more to do,\" she told senators.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States, who has been urged by activists to elevate more Asian Americans to high-level jobs in his administration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATHERINE TAI<|>PERSON<|>Katherine Tai is the U.S. trade representative and the only Cabinet-level official of East Asian descent confirmed in Biden's administration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MERRICK GARLAND<|>PERSON<|>Merrick Garland is the Attorney General of the United States who met with advocates to discuss the context of the Georgia killings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANKLIN TAO<|>PERSON<|>Franklin Tao is a University of Kansas researcher who was indicted for failing to disclose a teaching contract with a Chinese university.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN C.
