The framing of this as a crime by a sex addict who wanted to kill sex workers, it's not exactly that. There's a lot of projection happening onto this crime that has to do with the inherent racism that exists in society around Asian \nwomen. \n\"I'm grateful to the hashtags #StopAAPIHate and #StopAsianHate. All of these movements are really important, and they really connect us in way that is really new and really vital and really effective.\" \nBD Wong \nActor \n\"I try really hard to look at these kinds of things in a big-picture kind of way. Even though it's very hard when you are part of the group that's either being targeted or subject to these incidents. In my lifetime, I don't really remember it being quite like this: Where the conversation that ensues is a really positive and important one. But the pain that it is in response to is incredibly intense. Asian people are really known for a kind of reservation when it comes to calling attention to themselves and their problems in a somewhat cultural way. And that's a very broad statement - of course there are plenty of Asian-American people who do not do this - but equally I think there's a tradition of choosing to let things slide. For me what it is is kind of watching people in my community - who I think of as very strong and very able to be resilient - to see them really challenged by these events is very worrisome. And your heart breaks for them. Because it's also unnecessary. I don't understand who has it in them to actually push an old lady in the street.\" \nJason Wu \nDesigner\" I often ask myself why I have not spoken up about this topic in the past. It is perhaps due to my Asian upbringing where we were taught to keep our heads down, work hard and avoid confrontation. I believe it is now time to bring all of the underlying issues to the surface and for us to speak up and acknowledge the grossly overlooked history of racism against the AAPI communit\". \nI spent most of my life being insecure about myself because the Western standard of beauty has always reigned supreme. As a proud Asian man today, I am done with being silent and the 'model minority' - the time for action is n❞w. \nJennifer Cheon Garcia \nActres\" \nThere is no turning away from seeing all the violence happening to our AAPI and POC communities. But why would you/we want to? You/we need to see it to change it. We need to see the enemy we are fighting. This fight will be long. It will be ongo\"n. \nRemember to look after yourself, and the people you love. Surround yourselves with your allies, the people that have your ba\"k. \nTiffany Moon \n'Real Housewives of Dallas' star \n\"I immigrated to the United States when I was 6 years old and life was incredibly difficult, mainly because my parents were constantly working, and I started first grade without knowing any English. I was called names, had my facial features mocked, and sometimes was pushed or hit. I once even had my eyeglasses stomped on by a classmate\" \nAs I learned English and made friends, the overt racism and physical bullying subsided, but (it) transformed into an undercurrent of racism and microaggressions that I still feel to this day. 'Wow, you're really pretty... foran Asian girl.' 'Your name isn't really Tiffany. What's your real name?' 'You eat feet? That sounds disgusti\"g' \nWhen I was 14, I began working as a hostess at a Chinese restaurant. One Friday a group of kids came in to dine and one of the boys started calling me 'eggroll,' which was offensive but I never said anything abou\" it. \nTisha Custodio \nActress \nXenophobic violence against the Asian community is not new. I'm tired of witnessing me or my friends' Asian culture be the brunt of jokes. I'm tired of reading headlines of senseless mass shootings directed toward my community. I'm tired of feeling immense pain when thinking about the families who have unexpectedly and undeservingly lost their loved ones. I think this rise in hate crimes should be a catalyst for everyone to do research and start conversations to help fix this long-standing pro\"lem. \nAli Ewoldt \nBroadway star\" As an actor, I am grateful that I can help generate understanding and empathy for the characters I play, historical and fictional. As an actor of mixed race (Filipino and white), I acknowledge that my somewhat ambiguous features have allowed me to play a variety of roles that may not have been available to my fully Asian counterparts. But I know that it was seeing Lea Salonga, a fellow Filipina, play Eponine in 'Les Miserables' on Broadway when I was a child that inspired me to believe that I, too, could maybe have a career in musical th\"a er. \nThis importance of representation was reinforced when I became the first Asian-American to play Christine in The Phantom of the Opera' on Broadway after nearly 29 years of exclusively white Christines. I received letters, messages online and greetings at the stage door from young people who had previously felt excluded from opportunities like playing classic leading roles on Broadway because they were of Asian des\"ent. \nKelly Choi \nTV personality and host \n\"When I went to elementary school in Virginia, the first day of class was always a major source of stress for me because every single one of my new teachers would pronounce my last name like, 'Chow.' I would then have to politely correct him/her, but the embarrassment and shame that I felt when all the eyes of the entire class turned to look at me was almost unbearable\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
