Now many Asian Americans, for the first time, are having similar conversations with their children on how to gird themselves against a wave of anti-Asian sentiment, violence, and bullying.\nFor Mai Du and her 17-year-old son, Thomas Tran, talking about Asian hate may not be new, but playing out the what-if scenarios is.\nOver dinner recently, Du asked her son what would he do if someone was being harassed on the T. Would he confront the perpetrator? Would he look the other way? After some reflection, the Dorchester mother and son, who are Chinese-Vietnamese, came up with what they believe is the best course of action: Pull out your phone and take video.\n“That,” Du said, “is the first line of self-defense.”\nSome parents have been putting off these uncomfortable discussions, but they're now unavoidable after the targeted murders of six Asian-American women in the Atlanta area. One Korean-American mom's TikTok video — complete with flash cards “stop,” “Asian,” “hate” — has gone viral.\nBefore Atlanta, “it wasn't in my sphere of thinking,” said Jenny Lee, a Korean-American whose daughter is 5 and son is 7. “It's hard to talk about murder, especially with a 5-year-old. They can't even imagine. Why would anyone hurt someone else because of the color of their skin or their heritage?”\nTo open the door for conversation, Lee drove her kids by a recent rally for Asian Americans in Wellesley, where they live. Then at bedtime, Lee explained a little more about what's happening in the world.\n“We talk about why equality is so important and how the color of your skin shouldn't matter, but not everyone thinks that way,” said Lee, a medical devices executive.\nIt's a conversation her parents did not have with her. Growing up in Florida, she was 10 years old when she realized she was different after a boy on her school bus yelled: “Ching-chong, you don't have any eyelashes!”\nLee was shell-shocked. She felt less than. And, she doesn't want her children to go through the same rude awakening. “I want to be able to have that conversation first and see what is on their mind,” she said.\nGenerations of Asian Americans have been raised to work hard, get an education, and quietly assimilate. That is how my parents, immigrants originally from China, brought me up: Keep your head down because no matter what you'll always be treated like an outsider. Our silence, for the most part, has been golden — until now.\nThe Atlanta-area mass shooting at three spas by a white gunman has become our day of reckoning. The deaths of Daoyou Feng, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Soon Chung Park, Xiaojie Tan, and Yong Ae Yue could have been any one of our grandmothers, mothers, sisters, daughters, or aunties.\nLet there be no doubt that Donald Trump's xenophobic rhetoric, calling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” and “kung flu,” has made this country unsafe for Asian Americans.\nIn just one period in March 2020, researchers found about half of the nearly 800,000 tweets featuring #chinesevirus also included anti-Asian hashtags, many with violent implications. In the one year since, there have been nearly 3,800 incidents of Asian hate nationwide documented by the coalition Stop AAPI Hate, which believes the true scope is significantly under-reported.\nTrump may be out of the White House, but his legacy of hate remains. It now threatens the most vulnerable members of the Asian-American community, not only women but seniors who have been targeted in a spate of attacks coast to coast, including one that left an 84-year-old Thai man in the San Francisco Bay Area dead in January.\nThat means for some Asian Americans, “The Talk” has gone intergenerational. As Du counsels her teenager on how to deal with hate, she also has to warn her 82-year-old mother, who lives in Malden, not to go grocery shopping alone.\n“She has to be escorted at all times,” said Du, who owns and runs two martial arts academies.\nAlong with worry, the pervading feeling among Asian-American parents is anger that another generation born in the United States is being treated like perpetual foreigners. (Note to the rest of America: Chinese immigrants began arriving nearly two centuries ago as laborers to mine gold and build railroads. Today, Asian Americans are the fastest-growing community of color in Greater Boston and in the country.)\nConsider Hanh Tran, born in Boston, her mother one of the boat people who fled Vietnam after the war. Tran, who grew up in Dorchester and is not related to Thomas Tran, has tolerated racist taunts throughout her life, hurled at the most mundane moments, such as one at a gas station where a white man told her: “Gook, go back to where you come from.”\nBut as any parent can attest, it's different when your child experiences that pain of living in an ugly world. After the Atlanta murders, her 12-year-old son, Kenneth, who dealt with bullying at a previous school, felt unsafe. “I didn't want to go outside without a grown-up,” he said.\nAfter Atlanta, Hanh Tran gives voices to what so many Asian Americans are thinking: “Are you serious? I thought it would change. It did not change at all.”\n“I tell my family in Vietnam: You come to America. You think it's peaceful. You're living the life. It's really not,” said Tran, who lost her airline\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAI DU<|>PERSON<|>Mai Du is a mother who discusses Asian hate with her son, Thomas Tran, and emphasizes the importance of self-defense through video recording during harassment incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOMAS TRAN<|>PERSON<|>Thomas Tran is the 17-year-old son of Mai Du, who engages in conversations about how to respond to anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENNY LEE<|>PERSON<|>Jenny Lee is a Korean-American mother who discusses the challenges of explaining violence and racism to her young children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANH TRAN<|>PERSON<|>Hanh Tran is a Boston-born individual whose mother fled Vietnam, and she shares her experiences with racism and her concerns for her son after the Atlanta murders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KENNETH<|>PERSON<|>Kenneth is the 12-year-old son of Hanh Tran, who felt unsafe after the Atlanta murders and experienced bullying at school.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the city where a mass shooting targeting Asian-American women occurred, prompting discussions about safety among Asian-American families.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a coalition that documents incidents of anti-Asian hate and advocates for the Asian-American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALDEN<|>GEO<|>Malden is the city where Mai Du's 82-year-old mother lives and requires assistance for safety while grocery shopping.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DORCHESTER<|>GEO<|>Dorchester is a neighborhood in Boston where both Mai Du and Hanh Tran have lived and raised their families.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is the pandemic that has been associated with increased anti-Asian sentiment and violence, particularly due to xenophobic rhetoric.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN RALLY<|>EVENT<|>An event in Wellesley where Asian Americans gathered to raise awareness about anti-Asian hate and violence.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAI DU<|>THOMAS TRAN<|>Mai Du discusses the importance of self-defense and how to respond to harassment with her son, Thomas Tran<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JENNY LEE<|>THOMAS TRAN<|>Jenny Lee shares her experiences and concerns about discussing violence with her children, similar to the conversations Thomas Tran has with his mother<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HANH TRAN<|>KENNETH<|>Hanh Tran expresses concern for her son Kenneth's safety and experiences with bullying, reflecting the broader issues faced by Asian-American families<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAI DU<|>MALDEN<|>Mai Du's mother lives in Malden and requires assistance for safety, highlighting the generational concerns about anti-Asian violence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The mass shooting in Atlanta has led to increased documentation of anti-Asian hate incidents by Stop AAPI Hate<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DORCHESTER<|>MAI DU<|>Mai Du and her family live in Dorchester, which is significant in the context of their experiences with racism and community<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to a rise in anti-Asian hate incidents, which Stop AAPI Hate documents<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JENNY LEE<|>ATLANTA<|>Jenny Lee's concerns about discussing violence with her children are heightened by the events in Atlanta<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HANH TRAN<|>ATLANTA<|>Hanh Tran's experiences with racism and her son's feelings of insecurity are influenced by the Atlanta shootings<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
