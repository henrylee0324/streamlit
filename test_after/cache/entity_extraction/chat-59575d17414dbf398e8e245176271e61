It was so unexpected as I was having a normal day working from the office, I immediately put aside my work and rushed home. This was around January of last year when the country was still business as usual, but the looming threat of the Covid19 Pandemic has already penetrated people’s consciousness.\nAsians wearing face masks on the streets were singled out.\nThis was also around the time when the tit for tat tradewar and xenophobic rhetorics have already been retweeted and shared many times. The news of Chinese government cover ups echoed from social media to the streets. This concoction of fear, anxiety, and dirty politics gave rise to a new wave of hate based crimes that specifically targeted Asians. Presidential rhetorics like “Chinavirus” played a catalytic role to help spread this new wave of xenophobic anxiety by linking the Virus’ origin to those people who are also Americans but of Asian ancestry.\nMy wife’s attack took place outside of my son’s school during rush hour at school drop off time.\nThe attacker was also a mother of a student and she was road raging.\nShe thought my wife was an easy target when she came out of her car to scream at my wife at the Red Light. This was all because she couldn’t cut in front of my wife’s car.\nWhile the assailant was striking my wife’s head with her phone, my wife was blinded from the pouring blood coming out of forehead. Many passersby were parents, but everyone stood there while this was going on and no one intervened or screamed for help. But after my wife called the police, some passersby offered assistance and said the attacker had a history of anger problems outside of the school.\nMy wife had eye witnesses, dash cam video with sounds, yet the cop paid very little attention to my wife who suffered from the hate attack. Instead of arresting the assailant and recognizing this was a hate crime, the police instead treated this attack as a fight and arrested the attacker as well as my wife. My wife was verbally attacked with hateful racist slurs, then physically assaulted that required stitches and endured concussion. Instead of healing the wounds we had to spend extra time and money to lawyer up and fight for her innocence. We didn’t go outside to look for trouble, but the trouble found us, and on top the corrupt system further hurt us.\nThrough social media, our incident got the attention of local community activists in Flushing.\nWe were introduced to community organizations like “AALDEF The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund” and Minh Kwon Center. These nonprofit organizations have a long history of helping the community through tough times. We were told we can tap into these organizations to find lawyers. But we were also told the most effective option is to reach out to the media and make this incident big. We were told to throw a rally and hopefully we can make the matter big enough and attract local elected officials. We were told to file a hate crime report. We called the Hate Crime hotline. We also filed a Hate Crime report at the official government website. But like casting a stone into the abyss, no one followed up with us and our case was forgotten.\nAt the time there was no NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force . My wife’s hate attack experience was before George Floyd, was before the hundred of thousands of Covid deaths in America, and at a time when these new waves of attacks were still in a mythical and debated stage. Anti-Asian Crimes and xenophobic sentiments aren’t just a recent phenomenon but we find this rooted in American civil rights history, remember 1871 Chinese Massacre and 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese internment camp in WWII, and Vincent Chin are a few examples in history.\nI am outspoken but my wife is private and reserved. Even if a reporter approached me, without my wife’s consent, I wouldn’t be able to talk about her ordeal until she, the victim, feels comfortable. After my wife made phone calls to these defense leagues and community centers, she ran into misunderstandings, rudeness, and poor follow ups. She was told at one point there aren’t enough criminal laws and we were told the attorneys available don’t handle this type of case. After many phone calls and circling emails, we found ourselves back at the drawing table. Later I learned these public defense funds and community associations aren’t always inadequately funded and under staffed.\nDuring the time of crisis, my wife’s case was being brushed aside.\nMore and more we felt there was a desperation for media exposure, but not from us, but from those who wanted to help us. My wife and I couldn’t help but to feel our pain and anger have been secretly exploited for other people’s future expansions in local politics. We’ve long heard lip service from local elected officials on TV who talked about how every voice counts and how they represent the people. But it seems without holding a rally, our lives don’t matter.\nFinally we found a criminal defense lawyer recommended by the NY BAR Association.\nFor some reason, this lawyer was afraid to address the hate crime nature of our case.\nDue to Covid19 lockdown, our case was delayed for a year and eventually Queens DA dismissed the case.\nBut what about justice for our family? Well, we are free to pursue the matter in the Civil Court.\nIf you have ever been litigated against or\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
