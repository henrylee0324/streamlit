But it seems without holding a rally, our lives donâ€™t matter.\nFinally we found a criminal defense lawyer recommended by the NY BAR Association.\nFor some reason, this lawyer was afraid to address the hate crime nature of our case.\nDue to Covid19 lockdown, our case was delayed for a year and eventually Queens DA dismissed the case.\nBut what about justice for our family? Well, we are free to pursue the matter in the Civil Court.\nIf you have ever been litigated against or if you have litigated someone. If you have ever sat through criminal defense trials and paid the very expensive hourly lawyers fees. You should know suing someone isnâ€™t as easy as saying it.\nThere are identical stories that echoes through the tight knit communities like Chinatown about how a Chinese take out delivery man was robbed and beaten. The police would tell the delivery man, if you are not hurt, then we are leaving, but feel free to sue your attacker in court. Instead of helping the victim to file a report, the cops neglected their responsibility and took the easy way out by ignoring the real needs of the victim. Over time, this type of neglectful attitude felt by the community contributed to a general mistrust toward the police.\nEven though, by end Summer of 2020, the grassroot Anti-Asian hate crime movement and #TheycantburnusAll have helped create the NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force. To many in the Asian community, this new task force is just another show aimed to calm the media.\nHowever, those who volunteered in this lowly funded task force are Asian police officers who also have family members who are living in fear from the waves of Asian attacks. These Asian police officers desperately try to help bridge the gaps and bandage the wounds because they understand that too many victims only want to expose their hate attack experience on social media but they donâ€™t want to report to the police due to mistrust.\nI learned from my activist friends like Don Lee from Chinatown and corruption-fighting whistle-blower Asian police officer Sergeant Steve Lee from Flushing about ideas like a hotline that can help centralize the resources to help the community to report Anti-Asian Hate Crimes. From my wifeâ€™s experience I felt we do have the talents and resources, but they are scattered. Community legal teams are lowly funded and need better leadership. I think the idea of centralizing these resources by creating a hotline is a great idea, because many Asians in our community may still feel uncomfortable reporting crime to police because they donâ€™t trust the police. Before we can restore the police and community relationship, I feel a hot line can help victims report hate crimes without calling the police directly. And most importantly an independent agency which forwards hate crimes reports to the police can accurately track the number of Hate crimes against Asians.\nThis weekend, we joined our friends, allies, and hundreds of people and we rallied against hate at Columbus Park in Chinatown New York.\nThe large and diverse crowd of Asians and non-Asians banded together to show support and fight against racism and hate. We chanted, Asian Lives Matters, Black Lives Matters, We are golden, we are worthy. Rapper McJin came on stage with his 8-year-old son to help fight back hate and remind the crowd that in New York City everyday is Lunar New Year. While we stood in solidarity, I could not help but to wonder to myself why is it people have to die and why do we always have to band together in emotional rallies in order to make the system finally hear us and make some changes. I wish one day the system can finally work for us.\nThere are grassroot movements coast to coast to help make the Asian communities in America feel safer. From blockwatches to train stop escorts, I see people of all colors and backgrounds banding together to make us feel we are not alone and people do care. I hope our elected officials can communicate more for practical solutions rather than big ideas and campaign promises. I hope the victims one day donâ€™t have to feel like the only solution they have is to amplify their pain to the media in order to get the attention they deserve. Among the supporters fighting back against hate crimes there are also those who strongly feel Defunding the police is an important solution. In my opinion I feel there are places in the budget where we should defund the police such as in areas of legal protection for the cops, but for special units like the NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force, they need more funding. I hope our lawmakers can one day turn the NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force from a voluntary unit to a permanent special department.\nFrom my own observation as an Asian New Yorker I feel we tend to complain among each other about how nothing works and nothing changes, but ourselves are still silent to the world outside of our community. Like Mc Jin said, it doesnâ€™t matter if you have a social following of 70 people or 7000 people, every one of our voices count. I hope we all can continue to make our important dialogues and to share not just about our cultures and differences, but we need to talk about all the good, the bad, and the ugly. When we see someone being harassed or attacked we should speak out. When we see something wrong we should say something and do something about it.\nThere are knots that need to be untied and grudges need to be settled, we must keep on talking.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
