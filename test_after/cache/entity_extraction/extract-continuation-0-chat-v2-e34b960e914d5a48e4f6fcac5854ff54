Elderly Asians walking down the street were violently shoved to the ground by strangers who approached them with no clear motive other than to hurt a vulnerable person.\nThe hate and violence culminated last week in a massacre at Atlanta-area spas. A 21-year-old gunman killed eight people, including six Asian women, telling investigators he was battling a sex addiction and trying to eliminate temptation.\nHere are the stories of three Asian Americans who have dealt with racism all their lives and are now determined to speak up.\n--\nPicking his battles? Not anymore\nWhen Christopher Kim was in first grade, a kid on the playground called him \"Chinese boy.\"\nHe complained to a teacher, but she looked at him and walked away.\nHis parents said, \"Try not to let that worry you too much. They're just ignorant. They just don't know any better.\"\nThere were few other Asians in Shreveport, La., where Kim was born and raised.\nHe tried to explain that he was of Korean descent, but his classmates only seemed familiar with China and Japan.\n\"Early on, there was that feeling of exclusion and being the perpetual foreigner, so to speak,\" he said.\nIn sixth grade, a group of white boys surrounded him and taunted him for being Asian.\nKim wanted to hit them. But he knew that would not end well.\n\"I did my best to just keep my mouth shut. I knew they wanted a reaction out of me. So I just kind of took it,\" he said. \"It was a very humiliating experience, but I knew from every angle it was a losing situation. I knew it was just something I had to suffer through in silence.... I knew if it escalated beyond the verbal harassment, it was going to end badly, really it was going to end even worse than the harassment. It's one of those things where you really have to pick your battles.\"\nKim, 34, attended graduate school in public health at UCLA and lived in San Diego until recently.\nLast November, he moved to Dallas, partly to be closer to his parents. The recent attacks on elderly Asians have unnerved him. And he is no longer suffering in silence.\n\"I'm at the point in my life where I'm kind of like, 'This has gone far enough.' I can't stay silent anymore, in the background,\" he said. \"I have to speak up and really say something about this and really raise awareness that this is a serious issue and it does cost people their lives.\"\n--\n'If you don't speak up, people are going to bully you'\nLast February in San Mateo, Renee Lau's grandmother returned from walking the dog with a disturbing story.\nA white woman had approached her and asked, \"Do you speak English? Are you Chinese?\"\nShe speaks little English, so she could only nod in response. Then, the woman said, \"Go back to China.\"\nLau, 28, marched outside with her grandmother looking for the woman.\nAfter spotting her, Lau initially took a cautious tone: \"Excuse me, did you say this to my grandma?\"\n\"Well she doesn't speak English, does she?\" the woman responded.\n\"That doesn't matter, that's rude,\" Lau said. \"You just went up to her and said all this rude stuff to her because of the fact that she can't defend herself.\"\nThe woman then said your \"kind of people\" are corrupt and that \"no one wants you here -- you have to go back to China.\"\nLau's grandmother urged her to leave and \"not make it a big deal.\"\nInstead, Lau snapped a photo of the woman and reported her to the apartment's management. Nothing happened.\nBut the dynamic changed between her grandmother and the harasser. Her grandmother said she felt more confident after Lau's defense. The harasser now avoids them.\n\"If I didn't say anything, maybe every time they have an encounter, she might say something rude,\" Lau said. \"Good things come out of it. You just have to speak up or else it kind of enables the bullies.\"\nAfter all the assaults on elderly Asians, she is scared for her father and grandmother. But she believes that speaking up can help.\nIn high school, she was on the bus when a man came up to her and tried to get her attention.\nWhen she ignored him, he said loudly: \"Guess you don't speak English.\"\nShe answered, in English.\n\"He got embarrassed because he didn't think I was going to respond,\" Lau said. \"That's when I learned that if you don't speak up, people are going to bully you, especially if they think you don't speak English.\"\n--\n'I would use my voice better next time'\nIt has been years since high school, but the image is still burned in Sumalee Montano's mind.\nShe was running for student council president. On election day, someone spray-painted \"nuke the g--\" near the entrance of the school in central Ohio.\nThe principal called her into his office. The three boys who had painted the racist message were there, too, and apologized to her. They were friends of her opponent.\nBut that only made the incident scarier.\n\"I was just like, 'Why am I, a short, small, Asian girl alone in an office with a big, tall, white, male principal and three other big, tall, white guys, all jocks, who basically just threatened me?' All I wanted to do was get out of there as fast as I could,\" she said. \"It was so intimidating and frightening to be alone in that\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTOPHER KIM<|>PERSON<|>Christopher Kim is a 34-year-old Asian American who has faced racism and exclusion throughout his life, particularly during his childhood in Shreveport, La.
