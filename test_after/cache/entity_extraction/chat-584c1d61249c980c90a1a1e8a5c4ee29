Throughout her childhood, she and her siblings worked weekends at their parents' business, which grew from one booth to two, then three and eventually, a stand-alone store. \nNearly three decades later, Lee's mom still works 10 to 14 hours a day, every day, she said. \n\"What I appreciate about that is the hard work ethic that my parents instilled in me - to get our homework and everything done, so we can work on the weekends so we're selling things and studying and doing the best that we can,\" she said. \nLee read that the daughter of one of the slain women said her mom worked 12 hours every day. Lee thought: \"That's my mom. That's 100 percent my mom.\" \n\"That's what a lot of immigrants do: You come here to just build a better life and give a better life for your family. You'll do whatever it takes.\" \nAfter the shootings, Lee received a text relaying a warning about an active shooter targeting Asian businesses: Tell your Asian friends with businesses to shut down, and don't come out tonight. \n\"That was Tuesday night, and all of the stories we were hearing, when I was trying to pull up news reports, it was just so confusing. Then the next day the narrative had completely changed,\" she said, when the suspect told police that the shooting was not racially motivated. \n\"There's so many levels of injustice and racism in this, because we took the word of the shooter that it wasn't racism, but we didn't give that same benefit of the doubt to the women, who now have no voices to speak.\" \nDays after the shooting, Lee wrote a public post on her Facebook page addressed to the news media. She was upset and struggling to process the shootings, and frustrated with the lack of details about the women and the speculations about whether they had been involved in sex work. She wrote: \n\"These women deserved so much more. To be remembered with respect and dignity. I grieve them and how they were so unjustly portrayed. \nThis could have been my grandma. \nThis could have been my mom. \nThis could have been me. \nMedia, do better. Recognize your racial biases, and don't let this happen again. \nIn their memory: \nSoon Chung Park, age 74 \nSuncha Kim, age 69 \nXiaojie \"Emily\" Tan, age 49 \nHyun Jung Grant, age 51 \nYong Ae Yue, age 63 \nDaoyou Feng, age 44 \nDelaina Yaun, age 33 \nPaul Andre Michels, age 54 \n- Signed, An Asian-American woman\" \nThe weekend after the shooting, Lee marched with her children and her Korean American husband at a protest denouncing racism and violence toward Asians. They held signs carrying the names and ages of the shooting victims. She explained to her children that Asians were being discriminated against - which turned out to be an easier conversation than she had anticipated, because she had taken them to Black Lives Matter protests. \n\"I just can't believe in 2021 we need Black Lives Matter signs and now we're fighting against anti-Asian hate.\" \n\"I took my daughter to one of the rallies ... and was thinking, 'We have got to do better. For her.' The shooting sprees were about Asian women - grandmas, moms and me but it's really about her.\" \n- \nWhen Shyu found out about the shootings through her friends, she heard the gunman was targeting Asian-owned businesses. She immediately thought of her mother, who operates a hair salon on Atlanta's Buford Highway, catering to a mostly Asian clientele. The salon is located in a strip mall about eight miles from two of the three spas the shooter targeted. \n\"It made me really nervous when I found out the information because that just hits so close to home,\" she said. \"She works in a plaza called Pinetree Plaza. They're all Asian-owned. He could've gone door to door. Real quick. It would've been super easy for him. It was really upsetting.\" \nShyu already worried about her mother working during the pandemic. Now she worries about her even more. \n\"Day in and day out, they have to use their bodies to make an income and have their livelihoods be okay. And to have that threatened ... that just seems so harsh to me.\" \nShyu, whose parents are immigrants from Taiwan, was born in the United States and was raised in a tightknit Taiwanese American community in Atlanta. She works as an associate director at a media agency in San Francisco. \nAfter the shooting, she purchased pepper spray for her mom. \n\"I asked her, 'Don't you feel anxious or scared?' And she said, 'Julia, what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to be scared all the time? What's the point?' It made clear to me - I underestimate the fragility of it all.' \nYou feel protective of your parents as children, Shyu said. But then she remembers the strength and resolve of first-generation immigrants like her parents, who left their home countries to start new lives in America. \n\"There are a lot of things that come easy to us but not easy to them. Then I have to remind myself that actually, they made a life here on their own, so they're much more resilient,\" she said. \"My parents are much more strong than I give them credit for.\" \nWhenever Thao Lee hears about a mass shooting, she worries for her three children, who are\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
