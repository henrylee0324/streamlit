Andy Kim, an\nAsian American Democrat representing New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District.\nExperts say the COVID-19 pandemic did not start this new trend of discrimination toward the Asian American community,\nbut rather gave people an \"excuse\" to target them and highlights the long history of bigotry against them.\n\"I believe those statistics are being under-reported and that discrimination against Asian Americans in our country existed\nfar before COVID-19 and it will last after COVID-19,\" Kim said.\nAnti-Asian bias reports, which involve Asian or Pacific Islander individuals, jumped 74%, from 39 in 2019 to 68 in 2020\nacross the state, according to preliminary data compiled from the New Jersey State Police. However, these statistics are\nbased off what is only reported to police, as experts and officials believe there are more cases that go underreported.\n\"I am terrified,\" said Nina Gao, president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and a Shanghai native who lives in\nCherry Hill. \"I think a lot of my friends feel the same way, you know, is this safe anymore? Yes, a lot of these attacks you see\nhappening in the city, but if it doesn't stop, is it going to happen tomorrow or a year down the road in the suburbs?\"\nHere is a breakdown of reported bias incidents against Asian Americans by county across New Jersey:\nBergen: 14\nBurlington: 1\nCamden: 2\nEssex: 1\nGloucester: 1\nHudson: 4\nMercer: 7\nMiddlesex: 14\nMonmouth: 10\nMorris: 1\nPassaic: 2\nSomerset: 5\nSussex: 1\nUnion: 3\nWarren: 1\nAtlantic, Cape May, Cumberland, Hunterdon, Ocean, and Salem counties did not see any incidents of bias against Asian\nAmericans over the past year, according to New Jersey State Police. The report did not specify type of incident by county.\nAsian Americans reside in all 21 counties and in every part of the state. There are approximately 960,000 Asian American\nresidents, or 10% of the total New Jersey population.\nThe number of reported incidents seem to track by population: In Middlesex County, about 25% of the total county\npopulation is Asian American as of 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Bergen has an Asian population of 16%,\nwhile Hudson, Somerset, Mercer and Monmouth have populations of more than 10%.\nAcross New Jersey, bias incidents among all groups — not just Asian American and Pacific Islanders — involving aggravated\nassault rose by 18% from 2019 to 2020. Incidents involving a tactic of intimidation rose by 7.5%, while terroristic threats\nskyrocketed by more than 103% from 32 reports in 2019 to 65 made in 2020.\nThe State Police report also detailed an increase in incidents targeting Black, Latino and LGBTQ communities, showing that\nincidents of harassment and discrimination rose for the second straight year. In 2020, New Jersey recorded 1,441 bias\nincidents, which was the highest total ever recorded and a 45% increase from 2019's total.\nBut nothing stood out more than incidents involving harassment, as New Jersey saw an increase of more than 72% in this\ncategory — 421 in 2019 and then up to 726 incidents in 2020. Additionally, \"other\" forms of bias incidents, which includes\ndesecration of venerated objects, significantly rose by more than 278%, from 34 to 129 this past year.\nFor all race groups across New Jersey, simple assaults fell by about 4%, while bias incidents involving destruction, damage or\nvandalism to one's property fell by 3.5%, according to the annual report.\nStop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate (Stop AAPI Hate), a nonprofit organization in California, recorded 3,795 incidents\nof anti-Asian discrimination across the United States — a 26% increase from the prior year's 2,808 incidents. Some 42% of\nthe incidents were reported by Chinese Americans.\nNew York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were all in the top 10 for most reported incidents, the group's data showed.\nBetween March 19, 2020, through Feb. 28 of this year, shows that more than 500 incidents took place so far.\nBelow is a breakdown of the top 10 states with highest number of bias incidents against Asian Americans over the past year,\naccording to Stop AAPI Hate's report:\nCalifornia: 1,691\nNew York: 517\nWashington: 158\nTexas: 103\nPennsylvania: 97\nMassachusetts: 96\nIllinois: 92\nFlorida: 59\nNew Jersey: 59\nMaryland: 51\nThe most common types of discrimination involved harassment and shunning, which made up 68% and 20.5% of the group's\nreports.\nPhysical assault was the third-most common category, making up 11% of the total incidents across the country.
