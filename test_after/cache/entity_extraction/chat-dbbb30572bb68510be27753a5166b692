As the group grew, the question of how to leverage their own positions in the art world became central.\"It was one of the compelling things that we thought that we as arts workers could contribute to just because of the fact that so many art spaces, at least in New York and LA and even the Bay Area, were physically adjacent to Asian communities\" Tam said.Because of shutdowns, SDA's work has largely been visible on social media, Instagram above all. The organization has created multilingual graphics and downloadable posters, generated memes, commissioned short videos by artists, co-sponsored a Zoom webinar series titled \"Racism is a Public Health Issue\" and disseminated information about resources for Asian Americans facing discrimination and guidance for their allies.After the uprisings sparked by George Floyd's murder at the hands of police in Minneapolis in May, SDA called on its followers to act in solidarity with Black protesters.Its recent open letter against xenophobia and racial violence calls for the decriminalization of sex work and for alternatives to over-policing. It also asks signatories to understand the way that Asian Americans have enabled or participated (sometimes unwittingly) in white supremacy and work to dismantle it. So far, more than 1000 artists, curators and art workers have made the pledge.One of the key strategies for today's artist-activists is creating visibility: calling attention to the often unseen and unnoted presence of Asian American communities in cities and in the culture – to their labor and contributions and to the violence aimed at them.Countering invisibility is at the heart of a short film by Astria Suparak titled \"Virtually Asian.\" It splices together scenes from science fiction movies in which urban landscapes are filled with stereotypical \"Asian\" signifiers, but the actual characters are almost exclusively white. She worked on it during the coronavirus lockdown.\"The piece is part of a larger project examining 40 years of sci-fi films\" Suparak said \"and how white filmmakers envision a future that is inflected by Asian culture but devoid of actual Asian people.\"The project emerged Suparak said \"out of an ongoing erasure and racism and violence and how both in real life and in mainstream media our varied and unique cultures are carelessly misidentified and jumbled together.\"The newly appointed Public Artist in Residence Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya began to work with the New York City Commission on Human Rights in August. As soon as she was hired, Phingbodhipakkiya began devising a public art project that she would take to the subways to address the way Asian diasporic communities in the city go largely unnoticed.\"The commissioner and I went for a walk in Prospect Park\" she recalled. \"I'm not sure she was looking to brainstorm that morning but I hit the ground running. I felt like there was no time to waste and our community couldn't take being invisible any longer. It was something I approached with extreme urgency.\"The result of the collaboration is a public art series titled \"I Still Believe in Our City\" installed on bus shelters, subway stations and in a spectacular fashion on the side of the Barclays Center. The choice of transportation hubs was deliberate, the artist said, since so many bias attacks have occurred there. Phingbodhipakkiya has also made them freely downloadable on her website.Featuring a range of Asian Americans with captions like \"I did not make you sick\", \"We belong here\" and \"I Am Not Your Scapegoat\" they were recently featured on the cover of Time and have been showing up frequently on protest signs at rallies since the Atlanta shootings.Events over the past year have inspired some artists to begin to address themes of Asian American identities in their work. Tam who has long explored questions of masculinity in his video sculpture and photography has turned toward questions of Asian-ness. His solo exhibition \"Silent Spikes\" - a reference to the immigrant Chinese laborers who built the transcontinental American railroads is at the Queens Museum until June 23. In it, Tam connects stereotypes about the Asian male body with the image of the cowboy and its role in Westward expansion.Paul Chan is an artist newly spurred to action. His work while often overtly political has never addressed Asian issues head-on until now. (Chan's now-defunct publishing imprint Badlands Unlimited issued my book on art race and protest in 2018.) As soon as he heard about the mass shootings in Atlanta he produced a poster that reads \"Anti-Asian-Anti-Murican.\" The piece is part of his ongoing \"New Proverbs\" series which parodies signs used by the Westboro Baptist Church that he characterizes as \"arguably one of the pioneering Christian hate speech groups in America.\"\"The murders were the boiling point for me\" Chan said. \"I couldn't let the moment go by without manifesting my feelings into form.\"As artists begin standing up to anti-Asian hate, there remains the question of how useful the term \"Asian American\" is given the range of experiences it's meant to describe.\"Anicka Yi has said this very clearly: 'What does it mean to be Asian American in the 21st century?\" said Margaret Liu Clinton, a curator and member of SDA who talks about the desire to develop pan-Asian conversations among the widest possible swath of art workers.\"What continues to unfold is a shared awareness of how different our experiences are across gender, class, generation and immigration, and I think that's actually what is exciting about this work right now.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
