But for Asian American women who spoke to the Tribune, the killings last week were all the more painful because the violence reminded them of their own encounters with racism and misogyny.\nThat specific breed of harassment has dogged them throughout their lives, they said, and stems from centuries of America's discriminatory laws and widespread stereotyping of Asian women.\n\"The way Asian American women often experience racism in this country is hypersexualized,\" said Sung Yeon Choimorrow, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum. \"It is racialized sexual harassment. That's how it's experienced, so you cannot divorce the two.\"\nDuring the first week of the academic year at the Chicago high school where Chen works, which she requested to be unnamed for her privacy, three to four anonymous users logged into her Google classroom. Chen said after she spoke Mandarin, what sounded like a group of teenage boys shouted, \"Chinese (expletive)!\"\nChen tried to remove them but didn't know how, so in a panic she exited the room. She soon realized her students were still logged on, so she came back. The voices reemerged, this time using a racist term to mock the language. Then they left.\nChen said the principal was notified and from then on, teachers used a waiting room for unauthorized users. But the culprits have not been caught.\n\"It's like a trauma,\" Chen said. \"The school year, it's almost over, but I still have that trauma every time I open the link for my remote learning class.\" \nA centuries-old pandemic\nThe menace of attacks against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic has harmed male and female victims; in San Francisco, for example, an 84-year-old Thai man died earlier this year after a man shoved him onto the pavement. But a national coalition of Asian American organizations that collected 3,795 reports on anti-Asian racism from March 2020 to February found almost 70% of them came from Asian women.\nAuthorities identified those killed in Georgia last Tuesday as: Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; Yong Ae Yue, 63; Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Daoyou Feng, 44; and Xiaojie Tan, 49.\nThe deaths were both chilling and unsurprising to Choimorrow, a 39-year-old Korean American woman who lives in Skokie. The Saturday before St. Patrick's Day, she took her 6-year-old daughter to downtown Chicago to see the river that had just been dyed green. When she stopped by a coffee shop off Michigan Avenue, a man waited on the other side of the door.\nChoimorrow said she and the man both stood still until she opened the door. The man barged out and yelled, \"Chinese (expletive). That's right, you hold the d--- door for me. Don't expect me to hold the door for you.\"\n\"Every time it happens, all of the experiences you've had in the past is sort of like, you sort of get re-traumatized,\" Choimorrow said. \"It's the reoccurrence of these things that happen that really is what causes us the most harm.\"\nExactly a year before the Georgia shootings, Archer Heights resident Sara Zhang winced when then-President Donald Trump first tweeted a racist slur for the coronavirus, sparking an uproar among Asian American leaders who feared it would expose their communities to violence. But anti-Asian racism neither began nor ended with the Trump era, she said.\nViolence against Asians and Asian women in particular \"didn't just suddenly come out of nowhere\" as a result of Trump using racist slurs for the virus, said Zhang, an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Southern California. \"It's something that's historically rooted from the brutality of white supremacy and American imperialism.\"\nScholars of Asian American history trace the hypersexualization of Asian women to 1875, when the U.S. government passed the Page Act that effectively banned Chinese women from entering the country under the guise of prohibiting entry for what it described as \"immoral\" immigrants such as sex workers. It preceded the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act that included Chinese men. During the 20th century, American military occupation of Asian countries such as South Korea and Vietnam drove a sex industry as well as the fetishization of Asian women as sexual objects.\nZhang said she feels the weight of those stereotypes envelop her whenever she steps outside. Twice, she's been groped by men while she was a teenage girl, once at the CTA's Roosevelt Red Line stop and another time near her high school, Payton College Prep.\n\"I am an Asian woman, and I have to be aware\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUMMER CHEN<|>PERSON<|>Summer Chen is a Mandarin language teacher living in Chicago who has experienced racism and harassment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a city where Summer Chen lives and works, and it has been the backdrop of her experiences with racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the city where a shooting spree occurred at three spas, resulting in the deaths of eight individuals, including six women of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN WOMEN'S FORUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum is an organization focused on issues affecting Asian American women, including racism and misogyny.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOON CHUNG PARK<|>PERSON<|>Soon Chung Park was one of the victims of the Atlanta shooting spree.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>PERSON<|>Hyun Jung Grant was one of the victims of the Atlanta shooting spree.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNCHA KIM<|>PERSON<|>Suncha Kim was one of the victims of the Atlanta shooting spree.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YONG AE YUE<|>PERSON<|>Yong Ae Yue was one of the victims of the Atlanta shooting spree.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELAINA ASHLEY YAUN<|>PERSON<|>Delaina Ashley Yaun was one of the victims of the Atlanta shooting spree.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL ANDRE MICHELS<|>PERSON<|>Paul Andre Michels was one of the victims of the Atlanta shooting spree.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAOYOU FENG<|>PERSON<|>Daoyou Feng was one of the victims of the Atlanta shooting spree.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>PERSON<|>Xiaojie Tan was one of the victims of the Atlanta shooting spree.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRIDGEPORT<|>GEO<|>Bridgeport is a neighborhood in Chicago where Summer Chen resides.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKOKIE<|>GEO<|>Skokie is a city where Sung Yeon Choimorrow, the executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, lives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Southern California is where Sara Zhang is a freshman student.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAYTON COLLEGE PREP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Payton College Prep is a high school that Sara Zhang attended.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUMMER CHEN<|>CHICAGO<|>Summer Chen lives and works in Chicago, which has been the backdrop of her experiences with racism<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUMMER CHEN<|>ATLANTA<|>The Atlanta shooting spree has caused Summer Chen to reflect on her safety as an Asian woman in Chicago<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN WOMEN'S FORUM<|>SUMMER CHEN<|>The National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum addresses issues that affect individuals like Summer Chen, including racism and misogyny<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOON CHUNG PARK<|>ATLANTA<|>Soon Chung Park was a victim of the Atlanta shooting spree<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>ATLANTA<|>Hyun Jung Grant was a victim of the Atlanta shooting spree<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUNCHA KIM<|>ATLANTA<|>Suncha Kim was a victim of the Atlanta shooting spree<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YONG AE YUE<|>ATLANTA<|>Yong Ae Yue was a victim of the Atlanta shooting spree<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DELAINA ASHLEY YAUN<|>ATLANTA<|>Delaina Ashley Yaun was a victim of the Atlanta shooting spree<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL ANDRE MICHELS<|>ATLANTA<|>Paul Andre Michels was a victim of the Atlanta shooting spree<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAOYOU FENG<|>ATLANTA<|>Daoyou Feng was a victim of the Atlanta shooting spree<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>ATLANTA<|>Xiaojie Tan was a victim of the Atlanta shooting spree<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUMMER CHEN<|>BRIDGEPORT<|>Summer Chen lives in Bridgeport, a neighborhood in Chicago<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUNG YEON CHOIMORROW<|>SKOKIE<|>Sung Yeon Choimorrow lives in Skokie, where she advocates for Asian American women's issues<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SARA ZHANG<|>UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA<|>Sara Zhang is a freshman at the University of Southern California<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SARA ZHANG<|>PAYTON COLLEGE PREP<|>Sara Zhang attended Payton College Prep<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
