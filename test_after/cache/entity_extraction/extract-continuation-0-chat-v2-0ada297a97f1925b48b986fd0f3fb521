Police find the suspect, but are unable to reach the victim to conduct a photo lineup. \nWhen examining the factors that may have contributed to the local and statewide increases, Anastasia Tosouni, an associate professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice Studies at Sonoma State University, pointed to the unprecedented confluence of events last year, which saw widespread protests over the murder of George Floyd and broader calls for police reform, as well as a presidential election in which race was a central topic. All of that occurred against the backdrop of the pandemic, which disproportionately affected minority communities. \nHistorically, minorities, especially Black Americans, have experienced backlash in the form of hostility when they've asserted their rights in a strong and publicized way, Tosouni said. The country's Civil Rights era is one example. \nThe heightened awareness over racial justice-related issues may have also had an impact on local police officers, who ultimately determine whether a crime merits a hate crime classification, Tosouni said. \nCases that an officer may have not classified as a hate crime in the past, such a fight in which racial slurs were made by one of the parties, may have received that classification in light of the national discourse on race, Tosouni said. \n\"It might be the case that hate crimes have increased against Black Americans, or it might be the case that police departments in our country, and California in general are starting to be more assertive,\" Tosouni said. \nNews item: A Black family at Lake Sonoma finds the words \"white Pride\" written in the dust of their car on June 21, and a friend files an online police report. While the report is classified as a hate crime, deputies determine the vehicle is not damaged, and therefore no crime occurred. \nSanta Rosa, Sonoma County's most populous city, recorded 11 of the local hate crime reports last year, the most of any local agency, the FBI data shows. \nIt was more than twice as many as the five the department reported in 2019. In 2018, the department recorded six hate crimes. \nThe Petaluma Police Department and the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office reported six hate crimes each last year, up from four and zero in 2019, respectively. Rohnert Park and Healdsburg each accounted for one of the 25 hate crimes reported in Sonoma County last year. \nMahurin, the Santa Rosa police spokesman, said part of the increase his department experienced might have to do with its outreach to communities that have historically been hesitant to report crimes. \nA year-old computer system that the officers use to write police reports, which is part of an information-sharing consortium project involving most Sonoma County's law enforcement agencies, may also be making an impact, Mahurin said. \nThe system includes a section in which officers must indicate whether a crime included a hate crime component. If officers mark yes, they then have to identify the type of bias they suspect was at play. \n\"We have to make that decision as an agency,\" Mahurin said. \"Usually we err on the side of criminal investigation.\" \nNews item: An online report about a custody order violation in Santa Rosa last October indicates the crime included anti-Native American and/or Alaska Native bias, though the report contains no information on why. Due to the nature of the report, it is forwarded to the Sonoma County District Attorney's Office to handle as a civil matter, though it is automatically classified as a hate crime by the department, police said. \nA Press Democrat analysis of the hate crimes reported last year to local law enforcement shows discrepancies in how officers classified hate crime reports. \nIn Petaluma, for example, a U.S. Postal Service employee saw a toy monkey hung by a rope on a tree in front of a home on June 26, and police were asked to investigate. \nAfter speaking with the homeowner, police learned that the toy animal was an ode to a spider monkey that was a family pet. He had not realized the monkey he intended as a decoration was interpreted as a racist symbol, the homeowner told The Petaluma Argus Courier. \nNashelly Chavez \nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion, The Press Democrat \nWho calls the North Bay home and how do their backgrounds, socioeconomic status and other factors shape their experiences?
