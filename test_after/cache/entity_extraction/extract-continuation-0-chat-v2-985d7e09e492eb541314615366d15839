Since March 2020, advocacy groups have recorded nearly 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents, disproportionately targeting women.\nOn March 16, a mass shooter in an Atlanta suburb targeted three Asian-owned business, killing eight people, including six Asian women. Police later arrested Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, for the shooting. Long reportedly denied the killings were racially motivated, although Korean-language media are reporting a witness heard him say, I will kill all Asians.\nThe attacks come as statistics show a 150 percent surge in anti-Asian hate crimes since the start of the pandemic. People of Asian descent are at greater risk of violence and racism than they were a year ago and many live in fear. Women and older people are especially at risk. Asian women experience 2.5 times more anti-Asian violence than their male counterparts while older people of Asian descent reported being physically assaulted 1.5 times more than the overall Asian American and Pacific Islander population.\nHours before the Atlanta shootings, a 77-year-old man was violently attacked in Oakland, California, and in San Francisco a 64-year-old man was stabbed in the face and a 60-year-old man was pushed over and left partially blind. A week prior, a 75-year-old Asian man died after being robbed and assaulted in Oakland while an 83-year-old Asian woman was knocked unconscious while collecting cans in New York.\nOn March 1, an 18-year-old Asian woman was violently struck and choked in New York City. On March 12, a 26-year-old Asian woman was called racial slurs and sexually assaulted while waiting for a commuter train in San Jose. In September 2020, a mentally ill Asian woman was attacked and raped by a group of boys and men in Milwaukee.\nWhether or not the killings in Atlanta are shown to be racially motivated, they reveal the gravity of the risk and fear people of Asian descent are facing. In addition to ensuring full and fair investigations and accountability for these crimes, local and national leaders should clearly and forcefully denounce anti-Asian racism, misogyny, and white supremacy; develop plans with Asian American and Pacific Islander and immigrant communities to confront violence; and ensure appropriate resources are available for crisis intervention, long-term safety, and healing.\nSource: Human Rights Watch\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The Covid-19 pandemic began in March 2020 and has led to significant health and social impacts, including a rise in anti-Asian hate incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are individuals of Asian descent who have faced increased discrimination and violence during the Covid-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>PERSON<|>Robert Aaron Long is a 21-year-old man arrested for a mass shooting in Atlanta that targeted Asian-owned businesses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in Georgia where a mass shooting occurred, targeting three Asian-owned businesses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where multiple violent attacks against Asian individuals have taken place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California where an Asian man was stabbed in the face.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a city where several violent incidents against Asian individuals occurred, including an attack on an 83-year-old woman.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Human Rights Watch is an advocacy group that monitors and reports on human rights issues, including anti-Asian hate incidents.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>ATLANTA<|>Robert Aaron Long committed a mass shooting in Atlanta, targeting Asian-owned businesses<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a rise in discrimination and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OAKLAND<|>ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS<|>Oakland has seen violent attacks against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS<|>San Francisco has experienced violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK<|>ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS<|>New York has reported multiple violent incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS<|>Human Rights Watch reports on the discrimination and violence faced by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
