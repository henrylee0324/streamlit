The nonprofit organization Stop AAPI Hate\nhas documented nearly 3,800 incidents of physical assault, shunning, verbal and online harassment, and civil rights violations against the AAPI community in the US\nsince March 2020, when COVID-19 cases began to surge.In addition to taking place amid a spike in anti-Asian violence across the country, Thursday's hearing came days after a series of deadly shootings at three Atlanta-\narea massage parlors that killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women. Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, has been arrested and charged withmurder in connection to the shootings.\nHere are 5 key moments from Thursday's hearing\n• Rep. Chip Roy employed whataboutism to point the finger at China.\n* \"I think the Chinese Communist Party running the country of China, I think they are the bad guys,\" the Texas Republican said. \"I think that they are harming people\nand I think they are engaging in modern day slavery.\"\n• What they are doing to Uighurs ... what they are doing targeting our country ... what they are doing to undermine our national security, and what they are doing to\nsteal our intellectual property, and what they are doing to build up their military and rattle throughout the Pacific, I think it's patently evil and deserving of\ncondemnation,\" he added. \"And I think that what they did to hide the reality of this virus is equally deserving of condemnation.\"\n• Roy quoted an old saying glorifying lynchings at a hearing about racist violence.\n* All \"victims of race-based violence and their families deserve justice,\" Roy said. He then tacked on: \"There's old sayings in Texas about find all the rope in Texas and\nget a tall oak tree. You know, we take justice very seriously, and we ought to do that. Round up the bad guys.\"\n-Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 18, 2021\n• Rep. Grace Meng grew emotional while firing back at Roy.\n* \"Your president and your party and your colleagues can talk about issues with any other country that you want, but you don't have to do it by putting a bullseye on\nthe back of Asian-Americans across this country, on our grandparents, on our kids,\" Meng said.\n• The New York congresswoman choked up as she continued, \"This hearing was to address the hurt and pain of our community and to find solutions, and we will not let\nyou take our voice away from us.\"\n• Democrats accuse Trump and Republicans of fueling anti-Asian hate by using inflammatory rhetoric about COVID-19.\n* Several Democratic lawmakers skewered the former president and his allies for using terms like \"Wuhan virus,\" \"China virus,\" and \"Kung flu\" to describe the\ncoronavirus pandemic.\n• \"As we look at the outrage, let me put into the record: the 45th president always referred to coronavirus as the 'China virus' or 'Kung flu,'\" said Rep. Sheila Jackson\nLee of Texas. \"Let me call his name: President Trump.\"\n• \"The rise of hate crimes against Asian-Americans is inherently tied to anti-Asian American rhetoric, some of which has come out of this very chamber,\" said freshman\ncongresswoman Cori Bush. She went on to say that when such rhetoric is used by historically privileged groups, they \"have to own that it causes harm to people,\nespecially people of color\" because there are \"lives at stake.\"\n• Witnesses highlighted the US's long history of scapegoating immigrants and minorities in times of crisis.\n* \"As shocking as these incidents are, it is so vital to understand that they are not random acts perpetrated by deranged individuals,\" said Erika Lee, a professor of\nhistory and Asian-American studies at the University of Minnesota. \"They are an expression of our country's long history of systemic racism targeting Asian-Americans\nand Pacific Islanders.\"\n• \"We have heard in the past 24 hours many describe anti-Asian discrimination and racial violence as un-American,\" she added. \"Unfortunately, it is very American.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
