In January of this year, an 84-year-old was knocked down and killed by assailants who were depicted as young Black men. What this does is create the perfect storm of Asian/African American divide and giving law enforcement the excuse to not be able to do anything about it, and to also continue to paint the narrative of black disparity.\nSince the anti-racism protest in 2020, more and more attacks against other races have surged across the country, including attacks in Chinatown and many Asian-American communities. As reported by the Stop AAPI Hate coalition (Asian American and Pacific Islanders), there has been an uptick in Anti-Asian discrimination and attacks. One could point towards the rise of COVID-19 and the narrative of the virus' origin from China. This leads to ignorance and therefore thoughtless attacks against all Asian-Americans-some who have never even been to China, nor are from China at all.\nIn the IPSOS polls in the Center for Public Integrity back in 2020, 56% of Americans believed COVID was a natural disaster, while the 44/45% blame China, and 9% in that 44% blame the Chinese Government.\nToday, those numbers have altered to 57% believing COVID is a natural disaster, while 43% point towards specific people and organizations. Among those specifics, 54% believe China (including labs, scientist, and the government) are responsible.\nObviously, the virus and former President Donald Trump stirring the pot have created much of the incentive for these attacks, but such anti-Asian sentiments have existed since the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and the 1942 Japanese American internment camps issued by President Franklin Roosevelt.\nHowever, what does all this have to do with the African American Community?\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>GEO<|>The Asian American Community is a demographic group in the United States that has faced recent attacks and discrimination, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in Georgia where a mass shooting targeting Asian descendants occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROOKLYN<|>GEO<|>Brooklyn is a borough of New York City where an elderly woman was attacked and burned alive.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a state in the United States where significant incidents of violence against the Asian American community have occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a coalition that reports on anti-Asian discrimination and violence, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has been linked to increased discrimination and violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States whose rhetoric has been associated with the rise of anti-Asian sentiments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT<|>EVENT<|>The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was a significant piece of legislation that restricted Chinese immigration and has historical implications for anti-Asian sentiment in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPANESE AMERICAN INTERNMENT CAMPS<|>EVENT<|>The Japanese American internment camps were established during World War II, leading to the forced relocation and incarceration of Japanese Americans, reflecting historical discrimination.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>ATLANTA<|>The Asian American Community was directly affected by the mass shooting that occurred in Atlanta<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>BROOKLYN<|>The Asian American Community has faced violence, including the attack on an elderly woman in Brooklyn<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>Stop AAPI Hate reports on the discrimination and violence faced by the Asian American Community<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased discrimination and violence against the Asian American Community<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric has contributed to anti-Asian sentiments affecting the Asian American Community<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>The Chinese Exclusion Act has historical significance in the context of discrimination against the Asian American Community<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAPANESE AMERICAN INTERNMENT CAMPS<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>The internment camps reflect a history of discrimination that continues to impact perceptions of the Asian American Community<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
