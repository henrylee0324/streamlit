After his father was blacklisted by the Chinese government for his views, the family spent seven years in hiding from the Communist regime. \nIn 1996, they were able to escape to America, where Wu's father secured a job at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where Wu grew up. \nHe went to school at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill and got a job doing biochemical research right out of school. Then, like 9 million other Americans, Wu lost his job during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. \nBut Wu still wasn't an American. After 13 years in this country, he was still labeled an immigrant. So, he joined the military. \nWu spent four years as an active-duty combat medic in the U.S. Army. He was deployed overseas twice, once to Iraq, then to Afghanistan. He gained citizenship in 2014 and was honorably discharged from the Army in 2014, he said. \nWu now calls Greenville home, where he is an \"angel investor\" for several businesses, meaning he funds enterprises, but does not have a say in day-to-day operations. \n\"The American Dream has slowly evolved over the hundreds of years that America has existed, you know, I could be that example. My very existence is a wake-up call,\" Wu, 36, said. \nAs an activist for the Asian American community in the Upstate, Wu hopes his story will break down the barriers of racism and xenophobia that have plagued the Asian and Asian-American communities for hundreds of years. \nBut those barriers have become stronger during the past 15 months with the rise of anti-Asian rhetoric and violence during the coronavirus pandemic, when hate crimes are increasing at an alarming rate, according to nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate. \nAsians have been brutally attacked in San Francisco, New York, and in the Atlanta Spa Shootings, which left eight dead, six of which were Asian Americans. Georgia law enforcement officials say the murderer was not motivated by racism, but many, including Wu, dispute that claim. \n\"I believe (the suspect) to be a racist, but also misogynist,\" Wu said in a YouTube video posted to nonprofit Votes for Vets' YouTube \npage. \nCommunity and exclusion \nThe Korea Center of Greenville is housed in a log cabin in Greer, a short drive from Michelin and Top Golf on Pelham Road. Sara Yoon started the center in 2015 after noticing a need for Korean Americans to gather and learn in Greenville. \nThe center holds Korean-language classes for children and adults, hosts cultural events and barbecue competitions, and serves as a \"starting point\" for new Korean immigrants when they arrive in the area. \nYoon said simple tasks like writing a check, or understanding the cultural difference between Americans and Koreans can be overwhelming and confusing. She's there to help them wade through those turbulent waters. \nYoon came to America as a young adult, spending a lot of her life in New York and Florida before moving to Greenville with her husband... Greenville is where she built a real estate business, created the Korea Center nonprofit, and raised her daughter. This is \nher home. \nBut the past year has shown not everyone feels that way. The pandemic has led to a rise in anti-Asian rhetoric and violence. \n\"It just sad. And I am feeling betrayed because this is our country. If someone asked me to go home, I have no place to go home,\" she said. \"So it is kind of a sad feeling of betrayal for me as a Korean American who has lived here a lot longer than I have in Korea.\" \nAnd it's not just racism and violence the community is facing, it's unemployment. \nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders are also facing undue financial hardship more than other demographics, according to USA Today. Almost half of America's unemployed Asians face long-term joblessness (six months or more), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figures are worse than those for white, Black, and Hispanic workers, the report found. \nDid COVID lead to a rise in anti-Asian rhetoric? \nThe violence and racism Asian Americans are facing is not a new phenomenon. Since they began immigrating to this country in the 19th Century, Asians have been the targets of racist attacks and government action. \nIn 1871, a mob murdered 19 Chinese people in Los Angeles, according to Harvard University. The Chinese Exclusion Act - the first piece of U.S. Legislation to restrict immigration based on nationality - was passed four years later and barred Chinese laborers from entering the nation. \nAnti-Asian sentiment flared during World War II and the Vietnam War, leading to a rise in hate crimes and government-sanctioned atrocities, including the imprisonment of thousands of Japanese Americans in internment camps during the 1940s. \nMore than a quarter of all Asian Americans have experienced a hate crime during their lives, with 10% of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders saying they were the victim of a racist attack in 2021, according to Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit aimed at curbing hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. \nNo hate crimes against that demographic have been reported to the State Law Enforcement Division, according to spokesperson Tommy Crosby. But microaggressions - small or subconscious instances of prejudice and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HAO WU<|>PERSON<|>Hao Wu is a Greenville resident and activist for the Asian American community, who was born in China and became a U.S. citizen after serving in the military.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOREA CENTER OF GREENVILLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Korea Center of Greenville is a nonprofit organization founded by Sara Yoon to support Korean Americans through cultural events and language classes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARA YOON<|>PERSON<|>Sara Yoon is the founder of the Korea Center of Greenville, which helps Korean immigrants adjust to life in America.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a nonprofit organization focused on curbing hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to a rise in anti-Asian rhetoric and violence in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanderbilt University is where Hao Wu's father secured a job after the family escaped to America.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA - CHAPEL HILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill is where Hao Wu attended school.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. ARMY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The U.S. Army is the military service where Hao Wu served as a combat medic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA SPA SHOOTINGS<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta Spa Shootings were a series of hate crimes that resulted in the deaths of eight individuals, six of whom were Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN DREAM<|>EVENT<|>The American Dream is a concept that Hao Wu embodies through his journey from immigrant to citizen and activist.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAO WU<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Hao Wu is an activist for the Asian American community, which Stop AAPI Hate aims to protect from hate crimes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SARA YOON<|>KOREA CENTER OF GREENVILLE<|>Sara Yoon founded the Korea Center of Greenville to support Korean Americans in the community.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAO WU<|>KOREA CENTER OF GREENVILLE<|>Hao Wu's activism aligns with the mission of the Korea Center of Greenville to support the Asian American community.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAO WU<|>U.S. ARMY<|>Hao Wu served in the U.S. Army as a combat medic, gaining citizenship after his service.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAO WU<|>VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY<|>Hao Wu's father worked at Vanderbilt University after the family escaped to America.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAO WU<|>UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA - CHAPEL HILL<|>Hao Wu attended the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill for his education.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, which Stop AAPI Hate addresses.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA SPA SHOOTINGS<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The Atlanta Spa Shootings are an example of the hate crimes that Stop AAPI Hate seeks to combat.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAO WU<|>AMERICAN DREAM<|>Hao Wu's life story exemplifies the American Dream, showcasing his journey from immigrant to citizen and activist.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
