The correct names are Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant and Yong Ae Yue.\nWith the identities of all victims of Tuesday's shootings at three Atlanta-area spas now public, details remained scant Friday on several of the eight who were killed by a gunman.\nThe victims included six women of Asian descent and a woman and man who were white. Four of the women were shot down at two Atlanta spas. The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office said Friday that Soon C. Park, 74, Yong A. Yue, 63, and Hyun J. Grant, 51, died of gunshot wounds to the head. Suncha Kim, 69, had fatal wounds to the chest.\nThree other women and a man who died at a spa in the northwest suburb of Acworth had been identified previously. The victims included workers at the spas, a handyman and a customer. A man who was standing in the parking lot of the suburban spa when he was shot survived and was hospitalized.\nRobert Aaron Long, 21, who is white, is charged with murder in the killings at Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa in Atlanta and Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, 25 miles away.\nHere is what is known so far about the nine victims, including the survivor:\n--\nDelaina Ashley Yaun, 33\nYaun was a Waffle House server and grill operator who came into work every morning singing and blasting gospel music from her cellphone.\n\"She was a beautiful person, 100% caring,\" John Beck, 27, her friend and former Waffle House manager, told The Times. \"The kind of person would give the shirt off her back to anyone.\"\nHe said that when Yaun started working at the Waffle House three years ago, she let homeless people inside the restaurant, paid for their meals and sometimes brought them back to her home to let them bathe and give them clothes.\nYaun raised her 13-year-old son as a single mother and had long wanted another child, Beck said. But she struggled to find the right man -- until last year, when she met Mario Gonzalez. Eight months ago, she gave birth to their daughter.\n\"She ended up having a baby, got married,\" Beck said. \"She was truly happy, and she was the type of person that deserved happiness.\"\nFriends said that Yaun and Gonzalez were excited to go to Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, just a few blocks from the Waffle House, on Tuesday evening to unwind. Yaun was shot to death; Gonzalez was spared.\n\"Mario is completely devastated,\" Cristy Lynn McGouirk, who identified herself as Yaun's cousin, posted on Facebook. \"They were on a date night, and just wanted to relax. In a blink of an eye, she was taken from him.\"\n\"She had real good heart to her,\" Dustin Norman, 33, a friend and neighbor from Acworth, said as he stood outside the spa Thursday with a bouquet of yellow, lavender and white daisies. \"She did not deserve to go like this.\"\n--\nPaul Andre Michels, 54\nA businessman and U.S. Army veteran, Michels had been working at Young's as a handyman.\n\"He was a good, kind, loving guy,\" his brother John Michels, 52, told The Times.\nThe brothers grew up outside Detroit in a family of nine children. John said Paul served in the Army and owned businesses in home security and theater before moving to Georgia about 25 years ago.\nA hardworking Catholic who was politically conservative, Michels had been married for two decades, his brother said.\nIn an interview with Atlanta news station CBS46, a family friend, Kikiana Whidby, said Michels was unemployed and was doing handiwork for the spa to make ends meet.\nWhidby, who said Michels and his wife were godparents to her son, said he had built a shelf for the spa on Tuesday.\n\"He had been out of work for a while, and this was something that came to him and he was really excited about,\" she told the station. \"I'm mad. It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.\"\n--\nXiaojie 'Emily' Tan, 49\nXiaojie Tan, who went by Emily, was a mother, small-business owner and cosmetologist who lived in the town of Kennesaw, , and had an adult daughter who recently graduated from the University of Georgia.\nAn immigrant from China who visited her family there each New Year, Tan was the owner of Young's, which is in Cherokee County.\nPublic records show she held several licenses in cosmetology as well as massage therapy in Florida and Georgia.\n\"She was the hardest-working person. She was always working,\" said a close friend who came to the spa Thursday. \"It's so sad. Today is her birthday. She was supposed to turn 50 today.\"\n--\nDaoyou Feng, 44\nBesides her name and age, no information has been released about Feng, who was killed at Young's.\n--\nElcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30\nA mechanic from Guatemala, Hernandez-Ortiz was standing in a parking lot near Young's when he was shot, according to family members who spoke to local television stations in Georgia.\n\"Please pray for my family and the families that were affected by this shooting,\" his wife, Flora Gonzalez Gomez, wrote on a GoFundMe page.\nShe said her husband -- the only shooting victim who survived -- was hospitalized in intensive care.\n\"He was shot in the forehead down to his lungs and stomach,\" Gomez said. \"He will be needing facial surgery.\"\n--\nSoon C.
