Where are we in this day and age, and why do we stand by?\" \nSmith also mentioned the brutal attack on a 65-year-old Asian American woman in broad daylight, in connection with which Brandon Elliot, 38, of New York City, was recently arrested. \nIn a surveillance video, staff of the luxury apartment in front of which the assault took place closed the door in front of the grievously injured woman. \n\"If you can't act to protect a person of color, at least speak up about it,\" Smith said. \nPeople, she said, need to be educated about the various forms racism takes and move into accepting that the United States has a real problem. \n\"It has not gone away,\" Smith said of racism. \"But it should.\" \nEliminating racism, said Chong, will take more than not being racist; it will require actively working to be anti-racist. \nShe said the onus is on bystanders, particularly white people, to step up and use their voices for change. \n\"It can't always come from the people who are targeted,\" said Chong. \"It has to come from power, and in the United States white people have a lot of power - it's time for that community to speak up.\" \nThat means speaking out against racist language and behavior among strangers, family and colleagues, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\"We have to be comfortable being uncomfortable,\" Chong said. \n\"We have to be comfortable being uncomfortable.\" \nJ.
