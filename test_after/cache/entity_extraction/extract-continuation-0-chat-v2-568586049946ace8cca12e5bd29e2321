Los Angeles and San Francisco both saw an increase, from seven to 15, and six to nine, respectively. \nThe advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate said there were 3,795 hate incidents from March 19, 2020 to Feb 28,2021. A disproportionate higher number of these attacks were directed at women. The group stands up for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. \nChinese made up 42.2 percent of those who reported experiencing hate. They were followed by Koreans with 14.8 percent, Vietnamese 8.5 percent, and Filipinos 7.9 percent. \nAnti-Asian incidents occurred in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. California topped the list with 1,691 cases. New York trailed with 517 cases. It was followed by the state of Washington, 158 cases, and Texas with 103 incidents. Ohio had 40 cases. The nonprofit doesn't report its data to the police. \nDavid Liu, owner of Arcadia Firearm and Safety in Los Angeles, said people of all races and ethnic backgrounds are snapping up guns, causing supplies to be seriously depleted at his store, which is in a mainly Asian American area around 20 kilometers northeast of downtown Los Angeles. He is even having trouble getting products from his major suppliers, he said. \n\"Nobody could get their hands on a gun nowadays. Gun stores across the US are all running out of merchandise.\" \nDavid Stone, of Dong's Guns, Ammo and Reloading, a gun shop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said sales in his store have surged 400 percent since the start of the pandemic. \nAn Atlanta gun-shop owner, who didn't give his name, said there's been a \"significant increase\" in sales since last year, driven by people's desire for self-defense. He didn't notice any change in the number of Asian customers after the spa shootings. \n\"The focus on Asians, no, it's not. They've been buying from last year also.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino conducts analyses of hate crime statistics, particularly focusing on anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an advocacy group that stands up for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, reporting incidents of hate against these communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVID LIU<|>PERSON<|>David Liu is the owner of Arcadia Firearm and Safety in Los Angeles, who has noted a surge in gun sales among diverse racial groups in his mainly Asian American area.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVID STONE<|>PERSON<|>David Stone is the owner of Dong's Guns, Ammo and Reloading in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who reported a 400 percent increase in sales since the pandemic began.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles is a city in California where David Liu's gun store is located, experiencing a significant increase in gun sales.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TULSA<|>GEO<|>Tulsa is a city in Oklahoma where David Stone's gun shop is located, also seeing a surge in gun sales.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a state that reported the highest number of anti-Asian hate crime incidents, totaling 1,691 cases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a state that reported 517 cases of anti-Asian hate crimes, ranking second in the nation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASHINGTON<|>GEO<|>Washington is a state that reported 158 cases of anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEXAS<|>GEO<|>Texas is a state that reported 103 cases of anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OHIO<|>GEO<|>Ohio is a state that reported 40 cases of anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The pandemic refers to the global outbreak of COVID-19, which has influenced various social behaviors, including a surge in gun sales for self-defense.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Both organizations focus on the analysis and advocacy against hate crimes, particularly those affecting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVID LIU<|>LOS ANGELES<|>David Liu operates a gun store in Los Angeles, which has seen increased sales due to rising concerns about safety among diverse communities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVID STONE<|>TULSA<|>David Stone operates a gun shop in Tulsa, which has experienced a significant increase in sales since the pandemic began.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>California is the state where the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism is located, and it reported the highest number of anti-Asian hate crimes.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>New York is a state analyzed by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, which reported a significant increase in anti-Asian hate crimes.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>Washington is another state analyzed by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, which reported anti-Asian hate crimes.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEXAS<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>Texas is included in the analysis of anti-Asian hate crimes by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OHIO<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>Ohio is part of the states analyzed for anti-Asian hate crimes by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVID LIU<|>PANDEMIC<|>David Liu's gun store sales surged due to the pandemic, reflecting a broader trend of increased gun purchases for self-defense.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVID STONE<|>PANDEMIC<|>David Stone's gun shop sales surged due to the pandemic, indicating a significant increase in demand for firearms.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
