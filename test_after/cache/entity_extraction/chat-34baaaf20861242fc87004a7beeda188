Paul Michels had expressed interest in owning a spa and according to The Washington Post worked as a handyman at Young's Asian Spa.\nJohn Michels said his brother was \"just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" They grew up with nine siblings in Detroit, riding dirt bikes and spending summer weekends at a lake and getting into mischief together, he said. They both served in the U.S. Army at the same time and his brother was an infantryman in the late 1980s.\n\"I'm the closest in age so we were basically like twins,\" said John, 52. \"We did everything together growing up.\"Yong Ae Yue\nYong Ae Yue, 63, worked at the Aromatherapy Spa in Atlanta. She came to the USA from South Korea in the 1970s with her husband Mac Peterson, The New York Times reported. Citing Peterson, the newspaper said they met while he was stationed in the Army and had a son before moving to Fort Benning, Georgia, and later had another one. The couple divorced in 1982 but stayed in touch.\n\"She was a good mother,\" Peterson told the Times. \"She was always there for her kids.\"\nThe organizer of a GoFundMe page that has raised nearly $64,000, who goes by the name of Robert Peterson, said he is Yue's youngest son.\n\"Mom was an amazing woman who loved to introduce our family and friends to her home-cooked Korean food and Korean karaoke,\" he wrote. \"Will miss joining mom on her weekly Sunday routine to the grocery store and traditional Korean dinner. She was always kind-hearted and willing to help everyone she encountered.\"\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which cited Yue's two sons, said she was a licensed massage therapist who got laid off last year amid the pandemic and was happy to get back to work at the spa.Suncha Kim\nSuncha Kim, 69, was a grandmother who worked at the Gold Spa across the street from Aromatherapy and liked to line dance, the Times reported. Quoting a relative who asked not to be identified, the newspaper said Kim had been married for more than 50 years and had come to the USA from South Korea seeking better educational opportunities and a better life for herself and her family.\nThe Washington Post reported that Kim came to the USA around 1980 and after working a number of odd jobs offered her cooking services as a volunteer to help raise funds for several organizations. Family members told the Post she made her children a priority.\nOn a GoFundMe page that has raised more than six times the original goal of $20,000, organizer Hillary Li thanked supporters on behalf of Kim's family: \"It brings tears to our eyes that you are all standing with us and our beloved halmoni (grandmother), mother, and wife. Suncha was such a strong loving presence in all of our lives, and we miss her so much.\"Soon Chung Park\nSoon Chung Park, 74, who worked at Gold Spa, moved to Atlanta after spending the majority of her life in the New York metro area.\nHer son-in-law Scott Lee told the Post that after he married Park's daughter, they all lived under the same roof in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, before Park moved to Georgia. She had planned to move back in with Lee and his wife in June, he said.\nLee said Park liked to work and stay active.\n\"She was very healthy,\" he said. \"Everybody said she was going to live past 100 years old.\"Daoyou Feng\nDaoyou Feng, 44. Not much is known about Feng who, according to a friend of Xiaojie Tan's who spoke with The Washington Post, started working at Young's Asian Massage in the past few months and was kind and quiet.Elcias Hernandez-Ortiz\nElcias Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, survived the shooting and is hospitalized in intensive care. He was intubated and is set to have surgery to remove the bullet in his abdomen, his wife Flor Gonzalez told USA TODAY. She set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for medical costs where she wrote he was shot in the forehead, lungs, and stomach. \nGonzalez told USA TODAY that her husband was on the way to a business next door to the spa where he sends money to family back home. He called her during the shooting. \n\"They shot me, they shot me, come help me please,\" she said Hernandez-Ortiz begged. Those were the last words Gonzalez heard from him, she said on the verge of tears. \nThe two are from San Marcos, Guatemala, an impoverished municipality in the Central American country's rugged mountains. Hernandez-Ortiz came to the USA almost a decade ago. His wife and their 9-year-old daughter joined him in Georgia in 2015. \nShe said the family depends on Hernandez-Ortiz's work to survive. \"There are so many people that depend on him,\" Gonzalez said. \"I know he is strong and will come out of this for all of us.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
