On Tuesday the Biden administration announced the revival of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, new funding for Asian American survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, and a renewed commitment to improve health outcomes for Pacific Islanders. Importantly, the announcement includes improved Justice Department enforcement, data collection and transparency around hate crimes; information on the federal hate crimes website will now be provided in Chinese, Korean, Tagalog and Vietnamese. \nThese steps are certainly welcome, and yet much more will be needed, as the scope of the bias and xenophobia routinely faced by Asian Americans comes into closer view. \nTen percent of Asian American and Pacific Islander adults have experienced hate crimes or hate incidents this year, according to survey results released Tuesday by Survey Monkey and AAPI Data, a repository of demographic information and policy research. Conducted online March 18-25, the survey also revealed that more than one-quarter of Asian Americans report having been victims of such crimes at some point in their lives. Asian Americans normally report lower levels of hate crimes than Black Americans, but this year the two \ngroups are on par. \nThe survey also confirmed the microaggressions that Asian Americans routinely face: being asked where they \nare from, with the assumption that they are foreign-born; being encouraged to Americanize or \"whiten\" their names; having their names intentionally mispronounced; and even being spit or coughed upon. That last form of abuse is telling, as the recent wave of attacks has been linked to the xenophobia stirred up by former President Trump early on in the COVID-19 crisis. His use of hate-inducing, finger-pointing language like \"the China virus\" and \"kung flu\" - without bothering to distinguish between the policies of the Chinese government and the innocent lives of Asian Americans, many of whom aren't even of Chinese descent - stirred up this ugly surge. \nBut the anti-Asian bias has endured even with Trump gone from Twitter and the White House. In New York City alone this week, footage emerged first of an Asian American man beaten and choked on a subway train, then of a 65-year-old Filipino American churchgoer kicked repeatedly in the head and upper body in front of a residential building, whose staff did nothing. Both episodes are being investigated as hate crimes. \nIt is but the latest iteration of a pattern of xenophobia rooted in the American past: the massacres of Chinese \nin Los Angeles in 1871 and Rock Springs, Wyo., in 1885; the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II; the scapegoating of Muslims and South Asians after 9/11. \nThis is a pivotal moment for Asian Americans, many of whom only began identifying as such as a result of the civil rights activism of the 1960s. Not since the 1982 killing of Vincent China 27-year-old Chinese American man attacked by two Detroit autoworkers who believed he was Japanese and were enraged about the economic pressures on American carmakers have so many Asian Americans felt outraged and galvanized by hate crimes. Many worry that when the media attention subsides, so will the political urgency around confronting the causes of hate. \nThe sad fact is that Asian Americans, no matter their service to or achievements in America, are still too often seen as foreigners who don't fully belong in the United States. Their names, languages and cultures are mocked, and their humanity, distinctiveness and dignity are denied. Violent attacks by complete strangers, and the degradation of being spit or coughed on, are the tragic consequences of a long-standing failure of American society to recognize Asian Americans as individuals, worthy of respect and consideration just like everyone else. \nBeyond what President Biden announced Tuesday, there are many other steps the federal and state governments should consider, including victims' compensation funds, better tracking of anti-Asian crimes, more language resources on 211 and 311 hotlines and improved police-community relations. Perhaps, if the pandemic eases, so will the surge of attacks. But the larger sickness is societal. \nThis month, Asian artists were recognized in Oscar nominations like never before, and fuller, richer storytelling about the tremendous diversity of Asian experiences in the United States is long overdue. But until American society more thoroughly confronts and overcomes its long history of anti-Asian hate, the attacks are likely to \ncontinue.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIDEN ADMINISTRATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Biden administration is the current executive branch of the United States government, which has announced initiatives to support Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in response to hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE HOUSE INITIATIVE ON ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders aims to improve the quality of life and opportunities for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are individuals of Asian descent living in the United States, who have faced increased hate crimes and bias.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PACIFIC ISLANDERS<|>PERSON<|>Pacific Islanders are individuals from the Pacific Islands, who are also part of the demographic facing hate crimes and discrimination in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURVEY MONKEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Survey Monkey is an online survey platform that conducted a survey revealing the prevalence of hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AAPI DATA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AAPI Data is a repository of demographic information and policy research focused on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Former President Trump is the 45th president of the United States, whose rhetoric has been linked to increased anti-Asian sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is a major city in the United States where recent hate crimes against Asian Americans have been reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>PERSON<|>Vincent Chin was a Chinese American man whose murder in 1982 became a pivotal moment in the Asian American civil rights movement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles is a city in California where historical massacres of Chinese individuals occurred in 1871.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROCK SPRINGS<|>GEO<|>Rock Springs is a city in Wyoming where a massacre of Chinese individuals took place in 1885.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPANESE AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Japanese Americans are individuals of Japanese descent living in the United States, who were incarcerated during World War II.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSLIMS<|>PERSON<|>Muslims are individuals who practice Islam, who have faced scapegoating in the U.S. after the events of 9/11.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH ASIANS<|>PERSON<|>South Asians are individuals from the South Asian region, who have also faced discrimination and scapegoating in the U.S. after 9/11.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDEN ADMINISTRATION<|>WHITE HOUSE INITIATIVE ON ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS<|>The Biden administration announced the revival of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to address hate crimes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>BIDEN ADMINISTRATION<|>Asian Americans are the demographic that the Biden administration is aiming to support through new initiatives<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PACIFIC ISLANDERS<|>BIDEN ADMINISTRATION<|>Pacific Islanders are also included in the initiatives announced by the Biden administration<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURVEY MONKEY<|>AAPI DATA<|>Survey Monkey conducted a survey that was analyzed by AAPI Data to reveal hate crime statistics<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Former President Trump's rhetoric has been linked to the increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Recent hate crimes against Asian Americans have been reported in New York City<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Vincent Chin's murder is a significant historical event that galvanized Asian Americans against hate<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Los Angeles has a history of violence against Asian Americans, including the massacre of Chinese individuals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROCK SPRINGS<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Rock Springs is another historical site of violence against Chinese individuals, impacting Asian American history<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAPANESE AMERICANS<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Japanese Americans faced incarceration during WWII, which is part of the broader narrative of discrimination against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUSLIMS<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Muslims and South Asians have faced discrimination in the U.S., similar to the experiences of Asian Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH ASIANS<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>South Asians have also been victims of hate and discrimination, paralleling the experiences of Asian Americans<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
