I thought it would change. It did not change at all.”\n“I tell my family in Vietnam: You come to America. You think it's peaceful. You're living the life. It's really not,” said Tran, who lost her airline job during the pandemic and now is going back to school. “It's too good to be true.”\nFor Christine Koh, a Korean American and coauthor of Minimalist Parenting, the topic of inclusivity — whether race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion — has always been part of her conversations with her daughters, 10 and 16.\nBut the tone and focus began to change after Trump's election in 2016 and in the early days of the pandemic, when Koh herself could feel growing anti-Asian hostility in society. A year ago, before masks were mandatory, she felt self-conscious wearing a face covering fearing it would highlight her Asian-ness. In Asia, mask wearing has been widely accepted as a way to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.\nKoh, who lives in the Boston area, began to speak more directly about Asian racism with her daughters, especially her teenager, who has a cellphone and is plugged into the news. Koh's message is simple: If someone says something mean, don't suffer in silence, and always know Mom and Dad are here to support you.\n“There is a shame piece that is deeply rooted that keeps people quiet,” said Koh. “You think it's your fault.”\nKoh and her family experienced countless acts of racism in Belmont, where she grew up from the 1970s to 1990s, and in Jamaica Plain where her parents owned a convenience store. Koh recalls one incident around age 7 in Belmont, when she was out walking with her mother and felt the pelt of a hard object and a spray of cold liquid, followed by an epithet (”Take that chinks!”) coming from a group of teenagers in a moving car. She had been hit by a can of soda.\nHer second message to her daughters is to be aware of their surroundings. That means don't be glued to your cellphone when you leave the house. “Eyes up always,” Koh has been telling them. “You never want to get hit in the back of the head.”\nHenry Wright, a sophomore at North Andover High School whose mother is Korean American and father is Caucasian, is one of those kids who has kept his reactions to the bullying bottled up. On Snapchat, the 15-year-old's so-called friends would tease him about how Asians eat dogs and cats. In the hallways at school, students get in his face and hold up a yellow highlighter or a lemon, teasing: “What's the difference?”\nWright is not sure what to do. It's a common struggle: Do you respond and risk escalating the situation? His mother, Anna Choi, has been telling her son to ignore those kids. “You have to feel sorry for them,” said Choi, a professor at Endicott College.\nIn his college-entrance essay, Thomas Tran wrote about an experience last August: He witnessed a group of white boys biking past two elderly Asian-American neighbors, screaming: “Go back to your [expletive] country!”\nTran, who lives in Dorchester and is a senior at Boston Latin, reacted like so many of us would have: He froze. Not because Tran had never experienced racism himself, or that the incident was so shocking. In his essay, he concluded this: “I normalized racism in order to survive, and so have many others.”\nHe replays that day often in his mind. And now he understands that he can't let little acts of racism go because they add up, especially after the Atlanta killings.\n“What if it was my aunt, mom, or grandma, and that happened to them?” Tran pondered.\nThe burden of “The Talk” has been placed on generations of Black families — and now Asian Americans.\nFor me, it's has been easier to talk about this with my 71-year-old widowed mother who lives in California. I tell her not to go out alone, and she already decided not to go into Chinatown in Oakland. I know my mom is serious when she says, in Mandarin, that she's “xia si le,” a colloquial expression that translates as “scared to death.”\nIt's harder to talk about this with my two sons, ages 8 and 10. Over the past week, I've toggled between anger at having to do this at all, and a longing to insulate them just a little bit longer from the real world.\nIt's particularly heart-rending when my younger son stops me at: “What is Asian?”\nWe parents of color will continue to deliver “The Talk” as long as hate remains a threat. But to prevent history from repeating itself, we can't be the only ones doing the talking.\nTo truly stop the vicious cycle of hate, white parents need to do their part and have the kind of uncomfortable conversations that can root out racism before it grows into violent acts of hate.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HANH TRAN<|>PERSON<|>Hanh Tran is an Asian American who expresses concerns about the ongoing issues of racism and bullying faced by the Asian community in America.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTINE KOH<|>PERSON<|>Christine Koh is a Korean American coauthor of Minimalist Parenting who discusses inclusivity and racism with her daughters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HENRY WRIGHT<|>PERSON<|>Henry Wright is a sophomore at North Andover High School who experiences bullying related to his Asian heritage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNA CHOI<|>PERSON<|>Anna Choi is the mother of Henry Wright and a professor at Endicott College, who advises her son on how to handle bullying.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOMAS TRAN<|>PERSON<|>Thomas Tran is a senior at Boston Latin who wrote about witnessing racism against elderly Asian-American neighbors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DORCHESTER<|>GEO<|>Dorchester is a neighborhood where Thomas Tran lives and has experienced incidents of racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where the author's mother lives and has decided to avoid going out alone due to safety concerns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in Oakland that the author's mother has chosen to avoid for safety reasons.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta killings refer to a tragic event that heightened awareness of anti-Asian violence and racism.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HANH TRAN<|>CHRISTINE KOH<|>Hanh Tran and Christine Koh both discuss the impact of racism on the Asian American community and share their experiences<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTINE KOH<|>HENRY WRIGHT<|>Christine Koh's discussions about racism and inclusivity may resonate with Henry Wright, who faces bullying<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENRY WRIGHT<|>ANNA CHOI<|>Henry Wright is the son of Anna Choi, who advises him on dealing with bullying<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOMAS TRAN<|>DORCHESTER<|>Thomas Tran lives in Dorchester, where he has witnessed acts of racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANNA CHOI<|>HENRY WRIGHT<|>Anna Choi is actively involved in advising her son Henry on how to handle bullying<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HANH TRAN<|>ATLANTA<|>Hanh Tran's concerns about racism are heightened by the events in Atlanta<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTINE KOH<|>ATLANTA<|>Christine Koh's discussions about racism are influenced by the Atlanta killings<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOMAS TRAN<|>ATLANTA<|>Thomas Tran reflects on the implications of the Atlanta killings in his understanding of racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANNA CHOI<|>ATLANTA<|>Anna Choi's advice to her son is influenced by the broader context of anti-Asian violence highlighted by the Atlanta killings<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
