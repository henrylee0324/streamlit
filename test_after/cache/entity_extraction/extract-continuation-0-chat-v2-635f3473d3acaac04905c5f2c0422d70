Just last month, while shopping at the Duluth MegaMart, she said she felt a \"wave of fear\" as she realized how easily that location could be the subject of another attack. \n\"It reminded me that the pain we're carrying with us is always there, and it's hard to predict the triggers that will initiate that fear,\" Espinol said. \"I don't want to have to be fearful everywhere I go, and I don't want to have to deprive myself of going to spaces with other Asian Americans because I'm scared.\" \nIt's been more than three months since deadly shootings at three Atlanta-area businesses put a spotlight on Asian Americans across the country. As a year's worth of increased hate crimes came to a head and Asian Americans of all generations and ethnicities mobilized, politicians and corporations issued statements promising not to let violence go unnoticed. \nOver three months later, many East and Southeast Asian Americans in metro Atlanta remain afraid of verbal or physical attacks. Some have grown exhausted from coping with that heightened fear while attempting to educate others on their community's struggles through a slowed #StopAAPIHate movement. Many are skeptical that any substantial improvements occurred. \n\"I don't think anything has changed since the spa shootings,\" said Angela Jiang, a Singaporean-Taiwanese woman who grew up in Duluth and now lives in Buckhead. \"Nothing was really won besides a lot of resolutions and statements in support of the Asian American community that actually hasn't resulted in any material changes.\" \nPresident Joe Biden signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into effect on May 20. This legislation, introduced by two Asian lawmakers, intended to make reporting \"COVID- 19 hate crimes\" easier and tasked the Department of Justice with expediting hate crime reviews. \n\"We are committed to stop the hatred and the bias,\" Biden said as he signed the bill that acknowledged hate crimes as a \"serious national problem.\" \nDetermining how to prevent incidents before they happen, however, has largely been left to Asian Americans themselves, as national efforts to promote visibility and prevent violence reduced outside Asian American communities. \nThe sites of these tragedies reflect this diminished public interest: Aromatherapy and Gold Spas, two of the shooting locations, now appear closed, with no indication of reopening. Where memorial flowers and signs once lined the entrances to those businesses, traffic cones now block the parking lot entrances amid scattered pieces of \ntrash. \nSome Asian Americans fear that it will take more headlines and news reports of anti-Asian violence for substantive change to happen. Agnes Scott College student Connie Tran, whose Vietnamese parents run a nail salon in Columbus, said he believes simply condemning hate crimes and increasing investment in law enforcement are surface-level approaches that won't reduce discrimination. \n\"I'm a little wary because my mom and the other folks who run Asian-majority businesses feel like sitting ducks, waiting for the next instance to happen,\" Tran said. \"It feels like we're just walking around in a loop and not understanding the root cause of all this violence.\" \nA May 2021 report from Asian advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate found that Asian Americans are still \"experiencing unprecedented and growing health inequity issues brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-AAPI hate.\" \nWhile the pandemic worsened mental health for many in this country, researchers said Asian Americans who also encountered anti-Asian racism showed \"elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress and physical symptoms.\" \n\"It's a responsibility for all of us in the community to be aware of what's happening and talk about it and educate people,\" Espinol said. \"But this burden is falling on top of us having to process this pain happening in our community, and it just feels so overwhelming.\" \nGroups like the Asian American Resource Center (AARC), located in Duluth, expanded their mental health programs to field more requests for help. Handling that increased interest, however, takes resources that have slowed in the months since the shootings, said AARC Managing Director Xavier Kim. \nMany like Espinol subsequently became more vigilant in how they proceeded about everyday life, particularly in groups of Asian Americans. For some, that meant staying home more or enrolling in self-defense courses. Others, however, took more drastic measures. \n\"We are just scared, so that is the climate right now, it's everybody [being] afraid,\" said Daniel Fu, a 70-year old Indonesian man who purchased a gun after the shootings. \nPresident of the Korean Restaurant Association Southeast Andy Kim noted that many Asian-owned restaurants have hired security personnel or installed CCTV monitors to deter potential aggressors. \nKeun Soo Lee, who has operated Korean barbecue restaurant Honey Pig since 2007, said it was robbed for the first time after the shootings. Though he has since installed cameras and trained staff on handling anti-Asian violence, Lee worries that disregard for Asian Americans could intensify. \n\"As a restaurant owner, the fear of that kind of hatred has increased,\" he said. \nVeterinarian Jamie Cho said that even using her Korean surname is a potential risk. As Cho has opened a new practice, she explained she is more cautious when hiring workers and considered whether to tint the windows. \n\"I'm more aware of the decisions I make because I know that just saying nothing and keeping quiet does not mean that I'm safe,\" Cho said. \"I've feared and wondered, could my picture or name affect my success?\" \nDespite slowed momentum and heightened fears, Asian American advocates new and old said they're\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATHALIE ESPINOL<|>PERSON<|>Nathalie Espinol is a Filipina woman who experienced anxiety and fear after the killings of Asian women, affecting her daily life and activities in Asian American spaces.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DULUTH MEGAMART<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Duluth MegaMart is a grocery store where Nathalie Espinol felt fear due to the potential for violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city where three businesses were targeted in deadly shootings that raised awareness about violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian American community is a collective of individuals who have mobilized in response to increased hate crimes and violence against them.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act is legislation signed by President Joe Biden aimed at addressing hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGNES SCOTT COLLEGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Agnes Scott College is an educational institution where student Connie Tran is enrolled, and it is mentioned in the context of discussions about anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an advocacy group that reported on the health inequities faced by Asian Americans exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XAVIER KIM<|>PERSON<|>Xavier Kim is the Managing Director of the Asian American Resource Center (AARC) in Duluth, which expanded mental health programs in response to increased requests for help.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANIEL FU<|>PERSON<|>Daniel Fu is a 70-year-old Indonesian man who purchased a gun after the shootings due to fear of violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDY KIM<|>PERSON<|>Andy Kim is the President of the Korean Restaurant Association Southeast, who noted that many Asian-owned restaurants have increased security measures post-shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEUN SOO LEE<|>PERSON<|>Keun Soo Lee is the owner of Honey Pig, a Korean barbecue restaurant that was robbed for the first time after the shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMIE CHO<|>PERSON<|>Jamie Cho is a veterinarian who has become more cautious in her professional decisions due to fears of anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATHALIE ESPINOL<|>DULUTH MEGAMART<|>Nathalie Espinol felt fear while shopping at Duluth MegaMart, highlighting her anxiety about potential violence against Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>The Asian American community mobilized in response to the deadly shootings that occurred in Atlanta, raising awareness about violence against them<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act was introduced to address the concerns of the Asian American community regarding hate crimes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGNES SCOTT COLLEGE<|>CONNIE TRAN<|>Connie Tran is a student at Agnes Scott College, discussing the impact of anti-Asian violence on her community<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>Stop AAPI Hate reported on the struggles faced by the Asian American community, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XAVIER KIM<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Xavier Kim's organization, AARC, is involved in addressing the mental health needs of the Asian American community highlighted by Stop AAPI Hate<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANIEL FU<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>Daniel Fu's actions reflect the heightened fears within the Asian American community following the shootings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDY KIM<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>Andy Kim's comments about increased security measures in Asian-owned restaurants indicate a response to the fears within the Asian American community<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEUN SOO LEE<|>ANDY KIM<|>Keun Soo Lee's experience of being robbed after the shootings aligns with Andy Kim's observations about security concerns in Asian-owned businesses<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMIE CHO<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>Jamie Cho's cautious approach to her practice reflects the broader fears experienced by the Asian American community<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
