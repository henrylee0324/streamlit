Biden or his Vice President Kamala Harris Emhoff because both are corrupt and insincere blindly devoted to the bankers, militarists, and the globalists in general. The complete and shameful failure of the Biden-Harris removes unwanted invading American forces from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and ends the wars in West Papua, Libya, Yemen, and the low-intensity conflicts on the African continent (Mozambique, Congo, Niger, Mali, and Nigeria). The Biden-Harris administration is destabilizing Central America by encouraging the flow of drugs, human sexual trafficking of children and post-pubescent youth, and continuing trade policies that destroy the economic base of primarily agrarian societies. Biden, aiming to mask his corruption having used his former office as Vice President to facilitate influence peddling to illegally enrich himself and his immediate family, has feigned being tough on the Peoples' Republic of China which has given untold millions of dollars to the President's family. Further, Biden has hypocritically denounced the Chinese mass incarceration of its restive Uyghur minority but has defined his political career repressing Black Americans for a half-century. \nBiden is the architect of the most draconian laws on the earth that racially targeted millions of Black Americans to be gulag and warehoused in prisons that renewed constitutionally sanction slavery for Black Americans. Biden's disdain for China's human rights challenges appears to be the projections of a pathological liar, careerist racist, an unhinged corrupt sociopath berefts of his mental faculties and common-sense morality. Biden's bizarre obsession with homosexuality has prompted him to threaten loyal ally nations to forgo their religious beliefs and age-old creeds to appease his quack-science belief in transgenderism and non-binary sexuality. \nIn a world fighting to recover its economic moorings, Biden appears to be more preoccupied with imposing debased and immoral degeneracy and psychotic realpolitik than pioneering a genuine international policy that is attuned to the political realities of today. Biden's deliberate and premeditated attack on Syria and the continuance of the counterproductive and failed sanctions regime against the Islamic Republic of Iran manifest the maladroit and moribund foreign policy thrust of his administration. Whereas Biden has gained some international respect for returning to the United States to various treaties relating to global warming and trade, his decisions insult the highly popular \"America First Agenda\" of former President Donald J. Trump. Furthermore, the notion of Biden's providing a successful model to the world is sure to be tested as the restive and angry American public is being held captive to his ineffective and fraudulent COVID-19 \"pandemic\" program that is ignoring the serious social issues faced by 330 million Americans. \nThe Biden administration is neither capable of handling domestic or international issues, and his policies and those around him are clumsily too ideological on enraging the majority of the people with prevaricating promises, puerile policies, ineffective half-measures (i.e. student loan forgiveness waffling), continuance policies aimed to harm Black Americans, amnesty and/or at-will immigration, gun-seizure, tolerance of the assaults on First Amendment Freedoms (speech and assembly), and attacks on religious freedoms and culturally insensitive policy thrust (i.e. the transsexual agenda) threaten to incite mass social disturbances that will far exceed the scale and scope of the George Floyd riots. Biden will be no more able to be a respected global leader than was President Lyndon B. Johnson was during the \"Long Hot Summer\" racial riots of 1963 to 1968 nor George H.W. Bush, Sr. during the Rodney King Riots that swept America in 1992. Biden's health and his leadership are failing, and the whole world knows it, and the world is becoming more multipolar because of failed, corrupt, indecent, and ersatz leadership demonstrated by a succession of American presidents that are tragicomic versus genuine powerful men with vision and purpose. \nQ: What are the main rulers in America? Capitalists or lobbyists? \nA: The controlling interests that rule the United States of America is an inbred coalition of old established Anglo-European Banking families that can trace their lineage to royal or noble blood and those who are nouveau riche who have intermarried with the older oligarchical families. The new rich are primarily farrago of ethnys that all aspire to be either honorary White Anglo Saxon Protestant or are Roman Catholic or of the Jewish faith. All the commanding heights of production, important cultural, social, philanthropic, the military and religious institutions, the reins of government, and the purse strings of the public chest are controlled by what famed Sociologist C. Wright Mills called the \"Power Elite\" comprised in the late 20th century the 400 families that controlled America. \nThe wealth of the richest 1% of Americans constitutes an oligarchy that is allied with their over class peers who rule the other nations of the world. Elite people are the true power that dominates American life not the ballot box or the officials elected by voters. The lobbies' think tanks, research-advocacy institutions, and other entities all serve international finance capital, the conglomerated mass media, the high-tech industry, the agri-industrial complex, military-industrial complex, the medical- pharmaceutical complex, and hydrocarbon and energy sector.
