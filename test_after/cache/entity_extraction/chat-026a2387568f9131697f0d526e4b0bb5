As a bus driver in recent years, he was often cut off and told to \"go back\" to where he came from.\nHis latest encounter was Tuesday, when he arrived at a barber shop, signed the customer list and tried to walk out the door to wait outside. A white man, he said, stood in the doorway and blocked his path before saying, \"Get the f-- out of here!\" Yaplee, a Chinese American, was certain it was because of his race.\n\"I know you weren't talking to me,\" Yaplee told the man, who ignored him and walked inside. When Yaplee returned for his cut, the man continued to stare at him from outside until the barber told him to stop.\n\"I thought we were moving forward and away from all that,\" Yaplee said of racism in America.\nAfter the Atlanta shootings, Yaplee wrote on Facebook that it looked to be \"open season\" on Asian Americans in Atlanta. It was a comment that he reflected on more later.\n\"I misspoke because it infuriated me,\" he said. \"As you read into it and hear the news reports, they're saying maybe it wasn't racially motivated.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
