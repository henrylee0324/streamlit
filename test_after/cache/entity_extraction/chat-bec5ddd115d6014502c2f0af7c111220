Some say they are going out less -- and when they do, they go with other people for protection. Others say they have smartphones ready to record incidents of hate.\nHere are some voices from across Southern California:\n--\nBuying pepper spray in bulk\nThe slightly socially distanced line at Lien Hoa BBQ Deli inched forward. Customers at the takeout joint in Orange County's Little Saigon couldn't keep themselves from getting too close to one another as they neared the cashier to pay for fragrant roast pork and duck.\nPeople ordered juicy, sizzling meats from a heated glass display as talk swirled around headline news, including the arrest of what some described as \"the American man attacking Asian women.\"\n\"I saw on the news that the police haven't figured out why they have the crime. Is it because someone from a minority culture does not deserve as much protection? Or is it because they deserve to be standing targets?\" said Bill Tran, a tutor from Santa Ana. \"It's ridiculous that my sister, my aunt, my grandmother, can't experience security in their own city. No one feels like they can just run outside at any time.\"\nTran asked a worker at the barbecue spot whether he felt safe in light of increasing racially motivated attacks. The man shrugged, then confided that his daughters had bought a bulk supply of pepper spray.\n\"Even people in the ethnic enclaves are preparing,\" said Tran, 31, who is Vietnamese American. He makes sure his phone battery is always charged \"in case something happens and I need to record it. Videos will be our record.\"\n--\nA buddy system for security's sake\nNear the entrance of Peking Kitchen along Santa Ana's bustling 17th Street, Mary Lau and friend Lynn Porter texted family members to see whether they had any food orders.\nThe 20-something women say this week is a good time for comfort food, given what's happening in Southern California and around the nation.\n\"We're interested in the news about vaccines -- you know, how to get them -- but all we hear is about violence,\" said Lau, of Anaheim, who is Taiwanese American.\nShe visited Porter, who lives near the restaurant, and they decided to follow their pattern of supporting small businesses during the pandemic.\nShe said some of her buddies worry \"what would happen if these struggling stores become targets.\"\nLau worries for the mental health of immigrant families \"just trying to live their lives and stay safe. Many of them are doing honest work. They need public support for their right to live harassment-free.\"\nLau and Porter, who is half Chinese, say that when they leave home, they are never alone -- they make sure to have someone accompany them.\n\"In this environment, you need a buddy. Someone extra to be a witness,\" Lau said, \"in case something goes wrong.\"\n--\nRaising the racism issue on Instagram\nKym Estrada, a 29-year-old business owner in Long Beach, took to Instagram to express her frustration about anti-Asian hate that has bubbled up in the last year.\n\"We ain't a monolith,\" she wrote from the San & Wolves vegan bakeshop account. \"We span all different parts of an entire continent. My entire life I've seen my elders and peers being treated less than because of their slanted eyes and for not properly pronouncing a word correctly because English is their second or third language!? I'm telling you right now, this and future generations of Asian Americans will not allow this hate to proceed.\"\nIt's probably not the most strategic move to be so open about her beliefs on social media, and people send her direct messages telling her so, she said. But she doesn't care.\nShe wants people to know what is happening in her community, especially white folks who make up much of the vegan community and her following.\nShe writes from the safety of her computer, a privilege her immigrant parents didn't have.\nWhen she heard the news Wednesday morning about the attacks on Asian women in Atlanta, she felt surprised that she was so affected because it was so distant from her. But the moment has caused memories of racism to bubble up and moved her to take a stand.\nEstrada said she remembered people calling her Chinese as a kid and laughing, as though it were an insult, even though she is Filipina.\nHer parents didn't teach her Tagalog for fear of her becoming alienated from her peers. They never gave her homemade lunches to take to school -- they packed Lunchables instead, so she could be like everyone else.\nWhen she got old enough to date, she remembers being keenly aware of the fetishization of young Asian women. She made an effort to be loud and vocal, to avoid being seen as submissive and targeted by men. She avoided dating white men.\nIt comes as no surprise to her, then, that investigators claimed race was not a factor in the Atlanta attacks and that the suspect claimed to have a sex addiction.\n\"To me, it's quite obvious it was racially motivated,\" she said.\nIn the last year, she experienced a rise in disturbing encounters with strangers, she said.\nOne time, someone pushed her off a sidewalk. On another day, a man flipped her off as he drove past her. Her partner, who is also Filipino, has been told to go back to his country several times.\nDespite years of racism in her own life, this is a \"lightbulb\" moment, she said.\n\"I have always experienced some sort of anti-Asian hate in my life, but growing up I didn't see it as hate. I saw it as people making fun of me and my parents,\" she said. \"I accepted\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
