'Did any of those people actually reach out and call somebody? How many congregations actually know their non-white Jews?'This is my face-to-face plea,' she continued. 'I hope and pray that Jewish organizations will actually try and spend more time and create relationships with Asian Jews. It has to take people dying, oftentimes, for Jewish professionals to reach out to non-Jews. It has to take an intersectionality of Jewishness for us to take a cause as ours. It puts tremendous pressure on us Asian Jews that the only time we’re reached out to is when people are dying. We’re remembered only when there’s a crisis that has disturbed the waters. If even after COVID, people are still wondering if we are all interconnected, I’m just really surprised.' Rivera said her pain is palpable. 'I’m shaking inside as I’m speaking.
