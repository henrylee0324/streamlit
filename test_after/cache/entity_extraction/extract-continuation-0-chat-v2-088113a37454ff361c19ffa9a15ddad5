As Mr Parkash and many other minority commenters have noted, encounters with such racist attitudes are not uncommon. \nI have come to realise over the past year, talking to various people about race and religion, how much being a member of the majority Chinese community can blind me to the daily slights and insults felt by a non-Chinese person. Such obliviousness is not racist, but can be enablers of racism. \nFather Clifford Augustine, an Indian who sometimes describes himself as a \"big black man with a big brown dog\" Rufus, is a Franciscan friar. He told me recently: \"Do you know when I take the bus, even when it is fairly crowded, the seat next to me would be unoccupied? I am happy with that. I have the space. But it is telling.\" \nWe are both Singaporean. He is my friend. Hearing his quiet acceptance of his lived reality in the country of his birth tore me up inside. \nA few days later, I came across an article on racism on theconversation.com website from Australia that included this observation: \"A comment, joke or action doesn't need to be intentionally hurtful for it to be racism. But understanding this requires us to evaluate words or behaviours by their outcomes, rather than just their intention. \n\"Avoiding the seat next to an Aboriginal man on the bus could be hurtful, even if it was not intended to be. Imagine how this man might often face similar scenarios on his commute to and from work.\" \nPlenty of recent research has shown how repeated experiences of avoidance can accumulate to create stress and discomfort, even mental illness, in the recipient, the article added. \nThis is the explanation about why \"microaggressions\" matter. These are acts, words or assumptions in daily life that are targeted at minority communities, that make them feel different and as though they do not belong. It is easy for majority communities to make light of a stray comment here and there about race. But imagine facing comments like these each time you step outside your home, day in and day out. \nThose of us who are older grew up in a Singapore where casual racism was the norm. The concept of microaggressions had not been thought of; and we expected our friends of all races to laugh along at casual banter and racist comment. \nWe thought it was a mark of racial harmony that we all got along. But what if the price of that surface harmony was a thousand small cuts in the heart of our minority community friends? What if each careless comment or joke caused a small wound in his sense of self? \nWe can say - we did not know then. But we know now. Should we change or hark back to the fictitious good old days? \nI am beginning to realise that to fight racism, it is not enough not to be racist. One must also be anti-racist. This means speaking up against racist comment or acts when we encounter them, online or in person. Silence is complicit. Every non-response emboldens those with latent racist views to think they have supporters among us. Thus emboldened, some will escalate their words into action. \nIn fact, some already have.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PARKASH<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Parkash is a minority commentator who discusses encounters with racist attitudes and their impact on society.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIFFORD AUGUSTINE<|>PERSON<|>Father Clifford Augustine is an Indian Franciscan friar who shares his experiences with racism and social dynamics in Singapore.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUFUS<|>PERSON<|>Rufus is Father Clifford Augustine's big brown dog, mentioned in the context of his identity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>GEO<|>Singapore is a country where the narrative of racial harmony and the experiences of minority communities are discussed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CONVERSATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Conversation is a website that publishes articles on various topics, including racism and social issues, with a focus on academic perspectives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROAGGRESSIONS<|>EVENT<|>Microaggressions refer to subtle, often unintentional, discriminatory comments or actions that can accumulate to harm minority communities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIFFORD AUGUSTINE<|>SINGAPORE<|>Father Clifford Augustine shares his experiences of racism in the context of living in Singapore<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARKASH<|>SINGAPORE<|>Mr. Parkash discusses the impact of racism in Singapore, highlighting the experiences of minority communities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIFFORD AUGUSTINE<|>PARKASH<|>Father Clifford Augustine and Mr. Parkash both address issues of race and racism in Singapore<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CONVERSATION<|>MICROAGGRESSIONS<|>The article on The Conversation discusses the concept of microaggressions and their impact on minority communities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIFFORD AUGUSTINE<|>RUFUS<|>Father Clifford Augustine mentions Rufus, his dog, as part of his identity and experiences<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
