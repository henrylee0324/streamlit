These people who are getting attacked could be my parents. It's been nerve-wracking.\" \nShe relayed a heartbreaking moment from a recent charity event. \n\"A week before the Atlanta shootings, I was doing a cookie workshop with Kidsburgh. It's a family-focused cookie event, and one of the young girls is maybe 7 years old, and she asked me: 'How do you battle with being both Asian and a woman?' And then she kind of shyly said, \"because I'm Asian, too.\" \n\"That really hit me,\" she said. \nMs. Chaisri knows from experience how attitudes can change and that it's not always neat. She relayed a story from 1996 when she first came to the U.S. that would be offensive were it not so comical. Someone asked with a straight face if people still used elephants as vehicles in Thailand. \n\"I laughed my butt off and asked them, 'Where did you see this?' They said, 'The King and I.' I said, 'That was set in the 19th century.\"\" \nShe also told of an argument with a neighbor when she started her business. \n\"She would tell me to go back where I'm from, and she yelled at me with all kinds of words,\" she said. \nThe neighbor later apologized and acknowledged she was in the wrong. \"I accept that, no problem.\" \nBut, she said, this new variant strain of ignorance won't be tolerated at her restaurant. \n\"I told my staff, don't give them food and don't take their money. I want to make money, but I'm not going to bow down to this kind of people.\" \nShe added, sounding every bit an American, \"Forgettaboutit.\" \nCAPTION: PHOTO: Jasmine Cho: Cookies by Pittsburgh baker and art therapist Jasmine Cho show the weary faces of nurses in Wuhan, China, at the outset of the pandemic.
