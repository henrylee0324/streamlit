It came to a head last week with the shooting of eight people in Atlanta massage parlours, including six Asian women, although the perpetrator denies a racist motive. Now a 76-year-old Chinese woman who fought back against a white assailant has done more to inspire public empathy with the plight of her community than official expressions of concern and support from as high as the White House.\nGrandmother Xie Xiaozhen was standing at an intersection in San Francisco when a 39-year-old man ran up and hit her in the face. She picked up a wooden plank lying on the ground nearby and hit him in the face. A video clip of Xie, originally from Guangdong, looking shaken and crying out in Cantonese \"Why did you hit me?\" went viral as it was picked up by international and Chinese media. It showed Xie holding an ice bag to her bruised face while her assailant was put on a stretcher with blood dripping from his mouth.\nThe assault is an example of an outbreak of random attacks on older Asian-Americans in particular, leading to demonstrations in a number of cities after the shooting spree in Atlanta. Community activists attribute the discrimination and violence to political rhetoric about the pandemic because the epicentre of the initial outbreak was Wuhan, China.\nPresident Joe Biden visited Atlanta to offer solace to Asian-Americans. He denounced the scourge of racism at times hidden \"in plain sight\" and called for a halt to related violence. The authorities have come under scrutiny after a sheriff's official said the suspect had had a bad day before the shooting and was \"at the end of his rope\", reflecting criticism that white offenders are often afforded empathy.\nBiden may be saying the right things, but they should be directed mainly at supporters of the man he defeated in the last election, Trump. So far they have not been listening. Trump may not be in charge now, but it takes people like him to call out militant racist sentiment among his loyal following. In the case of resistance among his followers to Covid-19 vaccinations, Trump, to his credit, has urged them to have it, though Dr Anthony Fauci, his former medical adviser and now Biden's, has appealed to him to do more in this regard.\nSo long as race relations remain a visceral issue for many Trump voters among Republicans, and he mulls a political comeback, it is hard to imagine he can be persuaded to call out race hate unequivocally. Without a bipartisan consensus, it is to be hoped the forces of law and order are prepared to deal with the consequences without further inflaming feelings of prejudice and injustice.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>XIE XIAOZHEN<|>PERSON<|>Xie Xiaozhen is a 76-year-old Chinese woman who fought back against an assailant in San Francisco, inspiring public empathy for the Asian-American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former US president whose anti-Chinese rhetoric has been linked to a rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the current US president who visited Atlanta to offer support to Asian-Americans and denounced racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the city where a shooting spree occurred, targeting Asian-Americans, leading to public demonstrations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is the city where Xie Xiaozhen was assaulted by a man, highlighting the rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The Covid-19 pandemic has led to increased xenophobia and hate crimes against Asian-Americans, particularly due to political rhetoric.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is the city in China that was the epicenter of the initial Covid-19 outbreak, contributing to discrimination against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIE XIAOZHEN<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Xie Xiaozhen was assaulted in San Francisco, which is a significant event highlighting the rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Donald Trump's anti-Chinese rhetoric during the Covid-19 pandemic has been linked to a rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>ATLANTA<|>Joe Biden visited Atlanta to offer solace to the Asian-American community following the shooting spree targeting them.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>WUHAN<|>The Covid-19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, China, which has led to increased discrimination against Asian-Americans.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Joe Biden's comments on racism are in direct contrast to Donald Trump's rhetoric, which has been criticized for inciting hate.<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
