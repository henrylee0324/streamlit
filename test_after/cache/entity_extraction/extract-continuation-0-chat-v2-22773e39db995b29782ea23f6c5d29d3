More than six in 10 of his constituents are of Asian heritage, mostly Chinese and Korean.\n\"Asian Americans have been shoved and attacked in the downtown area of my district,\" says Kim, the only Korean American ever elected to New York's state legislature.\n\"Walking around the streets or on the subway you feel a lot of tension and anxiety.\"\nWhen Americans began feeling concerned about the coronavirus in February 2019, New York mayor Bill de Blasio headed to a Chinese restaurant in Flushing to show his support for the Asian-American community.\nRestaurants in the area were already reporting a drop-off in customers because of misguided fears that people could catch the virus from Chinese cooking.\nDe Blasio would later be ridiculed for encouraging people to gather in restaurants just as the virus was beginning to spread throughout the country. But he was right to be worried about growing discrimination against Asian Americans. Former president Donald Trump did not help by calling COVID-19 the \"China virus\" and the \"kung flu\".\nThe Stop Asian and Pacific Islander Hate group released a report last week showing it had recorded 3800 anti-Asian hate incidents over the past year. The vast majority were verbal harassment and shunning, but there were also hundreds of reports of physical violence.\nThe biggest spike occurred in New York City, which prides itself on being a progressive, multicultural melting pot. The attacks have continued even as coronavirus cases and hospitalisations plummeted in recent months.\nIn February there were four attacks against Asian-American women in New York on a single day. Two women were attacked on subways; one was pepper-sprayed while walking down the street; another was shoved to the ground.\nThe owner of Xian Famous Foods, a popular chain serving noodles and dumplings, revealed he had started closing earlier so his staff members could get home safely. Two of Jason Wang's employees were punched in the face in unprovoked attacks - something he said had never occurred before the pandemic.\n\"We have even young Asian Americans who refuse to leave their apartments in fear that they might be a target of a hate crime, that they might be spat on,\" Kim says. \"There's a lot of trauma and stress, and it's not just older Asian Americans who feel it.\"\nYet until recently, the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans had received relatively little attention. The issue was eclipsed last year by the Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis.\nThat changed last week when a white man shot dead six Asian women working in massage parlours in Atlanta, Georgia. The shootings helped drive protesters across the country. Grey's Anatomy actress Sandra Oh attended a rally in Philadelphia where she urged Asian-American protesters to chant: \"I am proud to be Asian! I belong here!\"\nKim says the shootings in Atlanta are an imperfect example of the broader phenomenon of anti-Asian attacks. The shooter, a white evangelical Christian, has denied that race was a motivating factor in the attacks, telling police he was driven to kill by a sense of shame about his addiction to sex.\nKim adds that anti-Asian attacks in his district have often been carried out by members of other minority communities, complicating the racial dynamics of the issue.\n\"We're seeing a lot of young black and brown teenagers attacking older Asian adults,\" he says.\n\"We have a lot of work to do to let people in these communities know that Asian Americans are not the ones that caused their grief and their economic distress.\"\nAs much as he disliked Trump's inflammatory \"China virus\" rhetoric, the Democrat says it's too easy to heap all the blame on the former president.\n\"We can't just put on a Band-Aid, blame Trump and call it a day,\" Kim says. \"That's not good enough.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RON KIM<|>PERSON<|>Ron Kim is the representative for New York's 40th state assembly district and the only Korean American ever elected to New York's state legislature.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLUSHING<|>GEO<|>Flushing is a bustling neighborhood in Queens, New York, known for its authentic Chinese food and a significant Asian heritage population.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILL DE BLASIO<|>PERSON<|>Bill de Blasio is the mayor of New York who showed support for the Asian-American community during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former president of the United States who referred to COVID-19 using terms that contributed to anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Stop Asian and Pacific Islander Hate group is an organization that tracks and reports incidents of anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is a major urban center in the United States that has experienced a significant spike in anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in Georgia where a tragic shooting incident involving Asian women occurred, highlighting the issue of anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANDRA OH<|>PERSON<|>Sandra Oh is an actress known for her role in Grey's Anatomy who participated in a rally supporting Asian-American protesters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JASON WANG<|>PERSON<|>Jason Wang is the owner of Xian Famous Foods, a popular chain serving noodles and dumplings, who has faced challenges due to anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>PERSON<|>George Floyd was a Black man whose death in Minneapolis sparked widespread protests, overshadowing the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON KIM<|>FLUSHING<|>Ron Kim represents the Flushing neighborhood, which has a significant Asian population and has been affected by anti-Asian violence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILL DE BLASIO<|>FLUSHING<|>Bill de Blasio visited Flushing to show support for the Asian-American community during the pandemic.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>STOP ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HATE<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric contributed to the rise in anti-Asian hate incidents reported by the organization.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HATE<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>The organization reported a significant spike in anti-Asian hate incidents occurring in New York City.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>STOP ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HATE<|>The shootings in Atlanta were a significant incident that highlighted the issue of anti-Asian violence tracked by the organization.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANDRA OH<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>Sandra Oh attended a rally in Philadelphia supporting Asian-American protesters, reflecting the broader movement in New York City.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JASON WANG<|>FLUSHING<|>Jason Wang's restaurant in Flushing has been affected by anti-Asian violence, leading him to change operational hours for safety.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON KIM<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Ron Kim criticized Donald Trump's rhetoric for exacerbating anti-Asian sentiment, indicating a political relationship.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON KIM<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>Ron Kim's district is located in New York City, which has seen a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>STOP ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HATE<|>The protests following George Floyd's death overshadowed the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, indicating a societal relationship.<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
