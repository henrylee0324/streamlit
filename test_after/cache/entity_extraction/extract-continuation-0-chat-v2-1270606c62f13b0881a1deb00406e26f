Chang explained that they would cancel the order, but it would take a while to give the customer a refund, FOX 5 Atlanta reports. She assured the customer the refund would come eventually. \nThe woman called the restaurant multiple times from two different numbers demanding a refund. When the refund finally went through, Chang texted a photo of the transaction to the woman's phone. That's when the harassing texts began. \nThe woman called Chang an expletive, threatened to physically harm her and blamed her for COVID-19. \nMany Asian restaurants have faced racism and harassment since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nIn March 2020, just a few weeks into lockdown, a Chinese restaurant in Washington had its windows smashed, NBC News reports. The vandal also left a message on the side of the building: \"Take the corona back you ch*nk.\" \nA ramen restaurant in Texas was vandalized with racist phrases like \"Go back to China\" after its owner spoke out against lifting the state's mask mandate in March 2021, CBS News reports. \n\"The community has to try to get along and support each other. We should respect each other, and we should not look down upon or trash any race,\" Chang told FOX 5 \nAtlanta.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GRAND CHINA RESTAURANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Grand China Restaurant is an Asian American restaurant located in Atlanta, owned by Tse-chih Chang, which has faced racist harassment from customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TSE-CHIH CHANG<|>PERSON<|>Tse-chih Chang is the owner of Grand China Restaurant in Atlanta, who received racist and threatening messages from a customer.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in the United States where Grand China Restaurant is located and where the incidents of harassment occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased racism and harassment against Asian restaurants and individuals, impacting businesses like Grand China Restaurant.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASHINGTON<|>GEO<|>Washington is a city in the United States where a Chinese restaurant was vandalized during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEXAS<|>GEO<|>Texas is a state in the United States where a ramen restaurant was vandalized with racist phrases after its owner spoke out against lifting the mask mandate.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TSE-CHIH CHANG<|>GRAND CHINA RESTAURANT<|>Tse-chih Chang is the owner of Grand China Restaurant, which she operates in Atlanta.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAND CHINA RESTAURANT<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Grand China Restaurant has faced racism and harassment linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TSE-CHIH CHANG<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Tse-chih Chang's experiences of harassment are part of the broader impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Asian individuals and businesses.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The vandalism of a Chinese restaurant in Washington is an example of the racism faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEXAS<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The vandalism of a ramen restaurant in Texas is another instance of racism linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
