Using police data, the center found that hate crimes against Asians in the U.S. increased by almost 200% between the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 - a sign, Levin said, that the trend has not yet peaked. \nSome community members have contacted Stop AAPI Hate in the wake of an incident as an alternative to calling the police, organizers say. The coalition does not have the capacity to directly respond to incidents of harassment, but plans to create online resources to help survivors, including multilingual videos that address actions people can take if bullied, ways to talk to a child dealing with trauma and how to talk to family about race. \nVolunteers also work on other projects aimed at changing common narratives about Asian Americans. \n\"If part of the issue is that Asians are being represented or seen as perpetual foreigners and treated as foreigners to be objectified and attacked, then we have to change that narrative,\" Jeung said. \"And narrative work involves education.\" \nThis past school year, more than 20 high school interns helped the coalition create social media campaigns and a series of workshops covering intersectionality, the yellow peril stereotype, Japanese American incarceration and mental health. \nRebecca Wu, a junior at Alhambra High School, spent part of the year developing the workshops, which will be posted on the center's website for use in high school classrooms and student club meetings. \n\"I was looking at the worksheets we made, the slides and the outline of the lesson...I was just so amazed,\" Wu said. \"That was kind of when I felt like, well, like we could be taken seriously.\" \nStop AAPI Hate has also been working with Asian American students to learn about their concerns and ideas for increased safety on school campuses. Student leaders drafted a letter with their suggestions which range from expanding mental health services to creating a multilingual, online hub for students to anonymously report hate incidents and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond sent it to district superintendents and charter school administrators on Thursday. \nAs the coalition has reported more and more cases, its volunteers say they've had to balance their own emotional struggles with the tasks at hand. \n\"It's really hard,\" Hopwood said. \"Acknowledging pain and suffering that victims feel, that we feel vicariously through them, (is) an important step to realize that this is not okay.\" \nJeung said he often spends his day being \"pulled from all sides,\" tending to media requests, working with corporations interested in donating to Stop AAPI Hate and attending listening sessions run by the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and the White House. \nEach day, he said, he goes through \"the range of emotions, from anger to depression to hope.\" \n\"We're still grieving over the Atlanta shootings. We're still angered by seeing our elderly pushed and shoved,\" Jeung said. \"That's, for me, a real heavy burden to support the community at the moment.\" \nOthers, like San Francisco State University graduate student Boaz Tang, who has been reviewing incident reports for the past year, say they are using their anger to fuel their volunteer work, instead of just stewing. \n\"I'm going to try to do what I can with the opportunities that I have, just so I don't have to sit on my rage and feel numb,\" Tang said. \nAlthough Stop AAPI Hate seeks to uplift Asian American communities during a time of need, the coalition has faced criticism for its name. And some activists say they worry that the focus on anti-Asian hate incidents is getting co-opted in a way that will lead to more police presence and targeting of Black people within Asian American communities. \nJacob Lacuesta, an Asian American Studies graduate student at San Francisco State, said he supports the coalition's efforts but that the name Stop AAPI Hate homogenizes the Asian American community and is a \"complete erasure\" of different Asian identities, leaving out South Asians and Middle Eastern people, among others. \nJeung said naming the organization was not the coalition's top priority. \"We didn't spend a lot of time thinking about or trying to brand ourselves,\" he said. \"We're just trying to address the racism.\" \nWhile the Stop AAPI Hate coalition has called for allyship between different marginalized communities, Lacuesta said some media coverage of attacks on Asian Americans has perpetuated anti-Blackness. \"Though there are perpetrators of many backgrounds, Black individuals tend to get the most media attention,\" he said. \nFor example, a Fox News segment from last month falsely suggested there is a conspiracy by other news organizations and Democrats to not \"identify the race of the attackers\" and strongly implied a majority of those attackers were Black. \nWhile Stop AAPI Hate does not advocate for increased policing as a response to the violence against Asian Americans, some government responses to the attacks have funneled resources to law enforcement, such as a new federal hate crimes law signed by President Joe Biden last month. That has drawn criticism from some of the coalition's supporters. \n\"When Stop AAPI Hate is democratized as a hashtag or as a movement...once it's in the world, you don't get to control it, you don't really get to reel it back, there's no undo button,\" said Tang. \"It's really cool that the movement has grown. But also, things can get co-opted, and it can be taken places that the people who started the organization never intended.\" \nMoving forward, members of the Stop AAPI Hate coalition say they hope to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a coalition that addresses anti-Asian hate incidents and provides resources for survivors, focusing on community support and education.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE & EXTREMISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at Cal State University, San Bernardino conducts research on hate crimes and provides data on trends in hate incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRIAN LEVIN<|>PERSON<|>Brian Levin is the director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism and focuses on research related to hate crimes against various communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REBECCA WU<|>PERSON<|>Rebecca Wu is a junior at Alhambra High School who developed workshops for Stop AAPI Hate aimed at educating students about Asian American issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TONY THURMOND<|>PERSON<|>Tony Thurmond is the State Superintendent of Public Instruction who received suggestions from student leaders regarding safety on school campuses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOAZ TANG<|>PERSON<|>Boaz Tang is a graduate student at San Francisco State University who has been reviewing incident reports related to anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>San Francisco State University is an educational institution where students like Boaz Tang study and engage in community issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA SHOOTINGS<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta shootings refer to a series of violent incidents that have heightened awareness and concern regarding anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRIAN LEVIN<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE & EXTREMISM<|>Brian Levin directs the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, which conducts research on hate crimes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE & EXTREMISM<|>Stop AAPI Hate's findings align with the research conducted by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REBECCA WU<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Rebecca Wu developed educational workshops for Stop AAPI Hate to help raise awareness about Asian American issues<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TONY THURMOND<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Tony Thurmond sent suggestions from student leaders to district superintendents regarding safety measures related to anti-Asian hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOAZ TANG<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Boaz Tang has been involved in reviewing incident reports for Stop AAPI Hate, contributing to the coalition's efforts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA SHOOTINGS<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The Atlanta shootings have been a significant event that has influenced the work and focus of Stop AAPI Hate<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
