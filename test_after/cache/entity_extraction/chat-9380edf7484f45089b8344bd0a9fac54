On April 15, many of the victims in a shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis were Sikh, a religion with origins in India. \nAsian people stated the violence soiled impressions of the United States as racially tolerant society and a top choice for overseas study and research, according to the newspaper. \n\"The human toll (from) the recent race-based violence has challenged those previously held beliefs\" among South Koreans that America was a model for good governance and multicultural society, Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul, told the daily \nJapanese national Akiko Horiba, 43, noted that she found Americans to be \"kind\" during her graduate study in Boston from 2001 to 2003, but now she's unsure whether she would come if she had the chance again. \n\"I would be a little afraid to visit America because I'm a woman and I saw a video of someone beating Asian ladies, I don't really recommend it to the younger generation,\" Horiba, who works in Tokyo, told the paper. \nThe Stop AAPI Hate, a group tracking incidents of violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, received more than 2,808 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian hate from March 2020 through the end of the year. \nThe California-based advocacy group tracked 987 in the first two months of 2021, the report quoted the group as saying. - FNA\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
