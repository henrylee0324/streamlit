It's insulated from the metropolitan world that's seen an uptick in violence toward Asian American people.\n\"I'm aware of the situation and I'm horrified,\" said Gilroy Chow, an 80-year-old retired Chinese American plant engineer who lives in Clarksdale. \"I can't say whether or not it was racially-motivated, but I am horrified that it happened.\"\nAsian American people make up 1% of Mississippi's population. Chinese American people living in the Delta hold a particularly rich history and still thrive as part of one of the most racially-diverse areas in the state.\nAround 1870, Chinese people immigrated from China's Guangdong province to the Mississippi Delta for economic opportunity. They went on to open dozens of family-run grocery stores in Black neighborhoods dotted along the Mississippi River.\nWhile marginal, Asian communities in the state remain tight-knit. Chow would know.\nHe's lived in Mississippi most of his life, but he can't recall a time he experienced anything to make him feel targeted in the state. He and his wife raised their two children in their Delta home.\nWhat happened was terrible, Chow said, but he isn't sure it couldn't have happened to anyone else in Atlanta. He said he's more concerned about his family catching COVID-19 than by being targeted because of it.\nLike Chow, Frieda Quon, 78, is Chinese American, and knows the Mississippi Delta well.\nShe's lived there her entire life. Having been a librarian at Delta State University before she retired, Quon said she's encountered many people over the years and never experienced racism in the area.\n\"We're civilized here,\" she said.\nSeeing events over the past year where more Asian American people have been the targets of hate crimes has concerned her, but she said she feels that isn't something that can happen in Mississippi.\n\"Look down there in Jackson,\" she said. \"You don't really hear of any attacks against Asian people down there.\"\nMore attacks could be happening because bigger cities have more people and cramped lifestyles can cause more stress among residents, Quon said. Combined with the COVID-19 pandemic, she said she thinks people are more on edge in general.\nFor Chow and Quon, the Delta has been a place free of discriminatory violence. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, only six racially-motivated hate crimes were reported in Mississippi in 2019 and none them occurred in the Delta region.\nBut outside that pocket, and into the bigger cities Quon talk about, the Tuesday incident in Atlanta is among the surge of violence toward Asian American people in the past year.\nAtlanta Police Department officials have not ruled out the possibility to classify the shootings as hate crimes, but several organizations across the country and President Joe Biden have condemned the attacks as such.\nRacist rhetoric stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in a market in Wuhan, China, is believed to have sparked these incidents of violence and harassment, according to data collected by Stop AAPI Hate.\nThe organization, formed to combat pandemic-driven racism against Asian American Pacific Islander communities, reported 3,795 incidents from March 19, 2020, to Feb. 28.\nVerbal harassment and the deliberate avoidance of Asian American people made up 88% of reported incidents within the past year, but another 11% accounted for physical assaults. Of incidents recorded by Stop AAPI Hate, Chinese American people were the largest ethnic group to suffer discrimination.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country where attacks against Asian American people have been on the rise since the COVID-19 pandemic began.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISSISSIPPI DELTA<|>GEO<|>The Mississippi Delta is a region that is insulated from metropolitan areas and has a rich history of Chinese American residents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLARKSDALE<|>GEO<|>Clarksdale is a city in the Mississippi Delta where Gilroy Chow, a retired Chinese American plant engineer, resides.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GILROY CHOW<|>PERSON<|>Gilroy Chow is an 80-year-old retired Chinese American plant engineer living in Clarksdale, Mississippi.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIEDA QUON<|>PERSON<|>Frieda Quon is a 78-year-old Chinese American who has lived her entire life in the Mississippi Delta and was a librarian at Delta State University.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELTA STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Delta State University is an educational institution where Frieda Quon worked as a librarian before her retirement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city where a recent incident of violence against Asian American people occurred, raising concerns among residents in the Delta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization formed to combat pandemic-driven racism against Asian American Pacific Islander communities, reporting incidents of discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States who has condemned the attacks against Asian American people.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has been linked to an increase in violence and discrimination against Asian American people.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is a city in China where the COVID-19 pandemic originated, contributing to racist rhetoric against Asian American communities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GILROY CHOW<|>CLARKSDALE<|>Gilroy Chow lives in Clarksdale, Mississippi, which is part of the Delta region.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRIEDA QUON<|>DELTA STATE UNIVERSITY<|>Frieda Quon worked as a librarian at Delta State University before her retirement.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GILROY CHOW<|>FRIEDA QUON<|>Both Gilroy Chow and Frieda Quon are Chinese American residents of the Mississippi Delta.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MISSISSIPPI DELTA<|>UNITED STATES<|>The Mississippi Delta is a region within the United States where attacks against Asian American people have been less prevalent compared to metropolitan areas.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The incident in Atlanta is part of a surge of violence against Asian American people linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Stop AAPI Hate reported incidents of discrimination that have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Joe Biden has condemned the attacks reported by Stop AAPI Hate as racially motivated.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WUHAN<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Wuhan is the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been linked to increased racism against Asian Americans.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
