That’s what I was really scared of when the pandemic first hit Cheyenne.”\nYuan, who plans to pursue a career in politics or advocacy, has participated in speech and debate since freshman year. Now a senior, speech and debate gave her an outlet to process her trepidation about anti-Asian violence and rhetoric this year.\nEducating new generations\nA standard history class in Wyoming doesn’t require teachers and students to discuss the context of heavy current events like the rise of anti-Asian sentiment. But for students who participate in speech and debate, no topic is off limits.\n“One of the most important aspects of speech and debate is that it stretches our imaginations so that we can see that the way things are is not the way things have to be,” said Marcus Viney, East’s head speech and debate coach. “The hope is to encourage a more thoughtful and compassionate world.”\nEducating more Wyomingites about the state’s history of anti-Asian violence and discrimination – which includes the Rock Springs Massacre of 1885 and the presence of the World War II-era Heart Mountain Japanese internment camp – is key to making life here more inclusive for everyone, said Aura Newlin, an assistant professor of sociology and anthropology at Northwest College in Powell.\n“Most of my students are from Wyoming or Montana, and I’ve noticed there’s a split in what they know about this history,” she said. Newlin is a fourth-generation Wyomingite and fourth-generation Japanese American whose great-grandparents were imprisoned at Heart Mountain in the 1940s. Newlin, who recounted two relatively recent xenophobic encounters in an opinion column published in the Casper Star-Tribune last week, characterized the bigoted sentiments in reaction to COVID-19 as “disappointing and horrifying,” but not surprising.\nShe said she hopes places like the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center, which is set to open an exhibit on disease stigma next month, and a stronger emphasis on Asian American history in the classroom will slowly help to change that reality.\n“The current generation of politicians wouldn’t have learned about any of this in school,” Newlin said. “It’s not an excuse for using racialized language or being ignorant today, but it gives me hope that future generations of leaders in Wyoming will have attended schools” that did talk about it.\n”We haven’t learned from the past”\nFor now, students like Yuan, who is waiting on application decisions from Harvard and Stanford, are forging a path for change in Wyoming and beyond.\nShe’ll deliver her speech at the national speech and debate tournament later this year. “Diseases can kills us, but fear is what will end us,” reads one of the most poignant lines.\nAnd after the murders of six Asian women in Atlanta last week, that message has become even more – if not painfully so – relevant.\n“It makes me sick to my stomach,” Yuan said. “This has happened before, and it makes me upset that we haven’t learned from the past.”\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHEYENNE<|>GEO<|>Cheyenne is a city in Wyoming where the pandemic's impact and anti-Asian violence were discussed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YUAN<|>PERSON<|>Yuan is a senior student involved in speech and debate, planning a career in politics or advocacy, and addressing anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCUS VINEY<|>PERSON<|>Marcus Viney is the head speech and debate coach at East High School, promoting thoughtful discussions among students.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURA NEWLIN<|>PERSON<|>Aura Newlin is an assistant professor at Northwest College, focusing on sociology and anthropology, and advocating for education on anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEART MOUNTAIN INTERPRETIVE CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Heart Mountain Interpretive Center is set to open an exhibit on disease stigma and educate about the history of Japanese internment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROCK SPRINGS MASSACRE<|>EVENT<|>The Rock Springs Massacre of 1885 is a historical event representing anti-Asian violence in Wyoming.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEART MOUNTAIN JAPANESE INTERNMENT CAMP<|>EVENT<|>The Heart Mountain Japanese internment camp was a facility where Japanese Americans were imprisoned during World War II.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASPER STAR-TRIBUNE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Casper Star-Tribune is a publication where Aura Newlin recounted her experiences with xenophobia.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUAN<|>MARCUS VINEY<|>Yuan participates in speech and debate under the guidance of Marcus Viney, who encourages thoughtful discussions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AURA NEWLIN<|>HEART MOUNTAIN INTERPRETIVE CENTER<|>Aura Newlin advocates for the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center to educate about anti-Asian violence and history<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AURA NEWLIN<|>ROCK SPRINGS MASSACRE<|>Aura Newlin discusses the Rock Springs Massacre as part of the history of anti-Asian violence in Wyoming<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AURA NEWLIN<|>HEART MOUNTAIN JAPANESE INTERNMENT CAMP<|>Aura Newlin's great-grandparents were imprisoned at Heart Mountain during World War II, linking her to this historical event<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUAN<|>CASPER STAR-TRIBUNE<|>Yuan's experiences and perspectives on anti-Asian violence are relevant to discussions published in the Casper Star-Tribune<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARCUS VINEY<|>YUAN<|>Marcus Viney supports Yuan's efforts in speech and debate, which address important social issues<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
