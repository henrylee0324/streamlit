victory in World War II,\nthere was then a need to claim victory at home as well,\" Oliver-Chang said. \"People at this time were arguing to fight\nfascism abroad and fascism at home and in some respects, people looked to the recovery of Japanese Americans from the\nincarceration experience during World War II, as evidence of the United States overcoming the color line.\"\nOliver-Chang said even though the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s played a major step in overcoming the racial barriers\nin the United States, Asian American voices still did not receive as much attention.\n\"I think it helps to explain some of the absence of Asian American voices during these time periods because Asian Americans\nwere drawing from the harsh treatment and atrocities happening in Japan, Vietnam and in Southeast Asia, to inform others\nof their own treatment in the United States,\" Oliver-Chang said.\nCongressman Kim, the son of Korean immigrants, said he has also had his fair share of experiences with racism and\ndiscrimination, but is more concerned about how much longer this issue will continue.\n\"There are a number of instances that really stick out, but I think what Asian Americans often feel is just this perpetual and\nconstant and rhythmic erosion of belonging that takes its toll,\" Kim said. \"I think it worries me and others, not just about\nhow we get through this moment and are we safe, but where are we heading as a country in this direction.\"\nWhat's being done\nExperts and advocates agree the rise in Asian American attacks in 2020 became more prevalent after President Donald\nTrump began to routinely refer to the COVID-19 pandemic as the \"China virus.\"\nIn January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order condemning the recent attacks against Asian Americans — and\nwithout naming them, criticized former federal officials who repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the \"China virus\" or the\n\"Kung Flu.\" Many believe he was criticizing Trump and members of his administration.\nThe order calls for better data collection about hateful incidents, along with mandating federal agencies to fight \"racism,\nxenophobia, and intolerance\" directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\"The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the\nactions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin,\" Biden\nsaid in his order. \"Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific\nIslanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment and hate crimes against AAPI persons.\"\nExperts and advocates agree addressing the root cause of the harassment and violence requires more education, more\nawareness of racism — not just focusing on one community but for all — and building political power for all minorities.Last March, a roundtable was hosted by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, Gov. Phil Murphy, Kim and other high-\nranking officials to discuss bias and hate crimes amid the shooting in Atlanta and attacks surfacing across the country.The Asian American Alliance in South Jersey will be hosting several marches and rallies in the coming weeks to raise\nawareness, share stories and help others understand the violence and discrimination is not just happening in the cities, but\nalso in the suburbs.\nIn North Jersey, hundreds of Asian Americans recently took to populated streets to spread awareness of hate against Asians,\nshedding cultural norms. Similar to the marches and rallies held by other activists this past year, protestors were seen\ncarrying posters and signs that read \"Stop Asian Hate\" and \"Hate is a Virus.\"\nLast Thursday, the Senate passed with overwhelming bipartisan support an anti-hate crime bill, which is known as the\nCOVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, to address the drastic increase of violence and discrimination directed at Asian Americans during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"We cannot let this slip by, we have to seize the moment when people are paying attention to make the kinds of changes\nthat will outlast the public attention,\" Oliver-Chang said. \"This is the moment when we need to build political power across\nAsian American communities, so that our communities know what the states are for our invisibility and if they don't speak up\nor report on attacks, we risk having this history repeated on us.\"\nHere are a few tips you can do to help fight discrimination against Asian Americans:\nReport any hate crimes to your local police or send tips to the FBI.\nSubmit tips to Stop AAPI's Hate's reporting center at www.stopaapihate .org/reportingincident, which has tracked thousands\nof incidents across the United States.\nYou can also go to Asian American Advancing Justice site at www.advancingjustice-aajc.org, where you have the opportunity\nto share your experience.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
