Sometimes it's worse than others. Sometimes it's unfortunately just another shooting,\" she said. \"But this one is different in that workplace ones always kind of hit a little close to home. And being primarily women and then Asian women, it was just a little harder, because obviously I identify as both.\" \nHatta grew up in a small town of 10,000 people in a northeastern Ohio. Her mother is White. Her father, who is Japanese, came to the United States in 1961 for college, where he met his wife. \nShe spent gap year in Tokyo, where her father is from, in the 1980s. People would ask her: \"Isn't America so dangerous? Don't people pull out guns all the time?\" \nDecades later, there have been so many mass shootings and so many people whose lives have been permanently altered by gun violence. But for Hatta, the Atlanta shooting impacted her on multiple levels. \nThere was a familiar banality of the circumstances: The victims were simply people who showed up for work that day, like herself in 2008. They were immigrants, like Hatta's father - who came to America for new opportunities. \nWhen Hatta found out six of the victims were of Asian descent, she thought about the fact that the thousands of verbal, physical and online attacks reported to the Stop AAPI Hate hotline since the outbreak of the pandemic have been disproportionately reported by women. \n\"You add a gun to the situation and Asian women are even more vulnerable.... Knowing people who chose to come here and made a life, and just to have something like this happen - I don't want to say it's worse than if it happened to someone else, but it adds so many layers as to why it hurts.\" \n\"You see people getting attacked for being Asian, and it's just kind of like: Where are we?\" \nLee, a retired college dean, is a fourth-generation American who was born and raised in San Francisco. She remembers hearing about the experiences her older relatives had with discrimination and assimilation. For example, her uncles changed their last names from Leong to Way, which is not immediately recognizable as Chinese, so they could blend in professionally. They were strategic about it, she said: Don't make waves. Don't make trouble. \nHer dad \"had lots of stories to tell us about how they were discriminated against, and they learned strategies to protect themselves and to deal with the racism that they just came to accept, in terms of treatment.\" \n\"That generation [my parents and grandparents], really, the thinking was: Come here. Lay low. Get your education.\" \nLee and her husband, a Korean American, have built their family with an eye toward making progress over the isolation and discrimination that their elder generations faced. They adopted two children from Korea and tried to make sure they always felt they belonged and were fully integrated into a diverse their community. \n\"As parents, we were very intentional about the decisions we made, in terms of where we were, where we lived, what schools, what friends we wanted them to grow up with,\" she said about her children, who are both adults now. \nBut she and her husband had hoped to see more progress by now. \n\"I still have an elderly aunt and uncle who live in the city. We go and have dinner with them every Sunday night and it doesn't feel safe in San Francisco, because of what's been happening across the country,\" she said. \"And I have not felt unsafe like this in my lifetime. I just haven't.\" \nShe said she believes former president Donald Trump and his attacks on China have played an outsize role in fomenting an environment of disdain toward Asian Americans. \n\"I know that there's a lot of mental health problems that we will face as a society because of covid, and I think that's part of it [the attacks],\" she said. \"But I believe that Trump calling it 'China virus' or 'kung flu,' that that kind of mentality, that kind of hatred and ignorance and racism that comes from a person who's the president of this country, trickles down.\" \nLee's reaction to the shootings in Atlanta: Shock. Sadness. And somehow familiarity, like the stories she had heard about her parents and grandparents. \n\"I think every immigrant's story is similar in some ways, where they just all want the same thing,\" she said. \"They want to be safe. They want to have food and housing. They want their children to have an education. They want to get a house at some point. It just seems like, why can't we make that possible?\" \ncontinued on next page \nMariah Hatta \n50, Little Rock, Japanese American \nKym Lee \n38, Smyrna, Ga., Taiwanese American \nJulia Shyu \n29, San Francisco, Taiwanese American \nThao Lee and daughter Pajouablai Monica Lee \n52, St. Paul, Minn. and 29, Berkeley, Calif., and Anchorage; Hmong American \nHJ Kim \n38, Fayetteville, Ga., Bangladeshi American \nSusan Lee \n70, Hercules, Calif., Chinese American\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in the United States that was the site of a mass shooting impacting the Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARIAH HATTA<|>PERSON<|>Mariah Hatta is a Japanese American woman from Little Rock who reflects on the impact of the Atlanta shooting and her family's immigrant background.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KYMM LEE<|>PERSON<|>Kym Lee is a Taiwanese American woman from Smyrna, Georgia, who shares her experiences related to discrimination and the Atlanta shooting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JULIA SHYU<|>PERSON<|>Julia Shyu is a Taiwanese American woman from San Francisco who is part of the discussion surrounding the Atlanta shooting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THAO LEE<|>PERSON<|>Thao Lee is a Hmong American woman from St. Paul, Minnesota, who is mentioned in the context of the Atlanta shooting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HJ KIM<|>PERSON<|>HJ Kim is a Bangladeshi American man from Fayetteville, Georgia, who is referenced in relation to the Atlanta shooting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSAN LEE<|>PERSON<|>Susan Lee is a Chinese American woman from Hercules, California, who reflects on the impact of the Atlanta shooting.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARIAH HATTA<|>ATLANTA<|>Mariah Hatta reflects on the impact of the Atlanta shooting on her and the Asian American community<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYMM LEE<|>ATLANTA<|>Kym Lee shares her experiences related to the Atlanta shooting and its implications for the Asian American community<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULIA SHYU<|>ATLANTA<|>Julia Shyu is part of the discussion surrounding the Atlanta shooting and its effects on Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THAO LEE<|>ATLANTA<|>Thao Lee is mentioned in the context of the Atlanta shooting, highlighting the experiences of Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HJ KIM<|>ATLANTA<|>HJ Kim is referenced in relation to the Atlanta shooting, contributing to the narrative of Asian American experiences<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSAN LEE<|>ATLANTA<|>Susan Lee reflects on the impact of the Atlanta shooting, connecting it to her family's immigrant story<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARIAH HATTA<|>KYMM LEE<|>Mariah Hatta and Kym Lee both discuss their experiences and reflections on the Atlanta shooting<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARIAH HATTA<|>JULIA SHYU<|>Mariah Hatta and Julia Shyu are part of the conversation regarding the Atlanta shooting and its impact<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYMM LEE<|>JULIA SHYU<|>Kym Lee and Julia Shyu are involved in discussions about the Atlanta shooting and its implications for their community<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THAO LEE<|>KYMM LEE<|>Thao Lee and Kym Lee share experiences related to the Atlanta shooting and its impact on Asian Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HJ KIM<|>KYMM LEE<|>HJ Kim and Kym Lee both reflect on the implications of the Atlanta shooting for the Asian American community<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSAN LEE<|>MARIAH HATTA<|>Susan Lee and Mariah Hatta discuss their feelings and experiences related to the Atlanta shooting<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
