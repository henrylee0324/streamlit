The experience made him feel lonely and betrayed. \"That loneliness translated into anxiety, depression, a whole myriad of mental health consequences.\"\nThe recent spa attacks unearthed the feelings Matharu had in high school. But his community at U-Md. keeps them from becoming overwhelming.\nSeparated by the pandemic, grieving has been relegated to Zoom.\nStudents also are supporting each other through traumatic events via text, instead of face-to-face. It has made a tense year even more strenuous, as students of color deal with waves of violence and social upheaval. Black students made similar sacrifices last summer as the world reacted to the police killing of George Floyd and demands for justice for Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.\n\"It's demoralizing,\" Matharu said. \"It hurts. But when I do talk about it amongst my community, I don't get that feeling of loneliness that I once got.\"\nMoving through crisis \nOn campuses across the country, counseling center staff are \"busier than ever,\" Patel said. Not only are more students requesting help, but their needs are more varied.\nThe pandemic also introduced the unique challenge of delivering mental health care across state lines. When students scattered to their homes across the country, on-campus health providers suddenly faced a hodgepodge of licensure laws that determined where they could and couldn't practice. Dozens of states have relaxed their restrictions, but 60 percent of students still say the pandemic has made it more difficult to access mental health care, surveys show.\nTo fill in the gaps, counselors are producing self-help videos, sharing advice on social media and using computer-assisted therapy programs that can be just as effective as in-person treatment, Patel said.\nJoan Gabel, president of the University of Minnesota, is ramping up an effort to bring together the five campuses that make up the state university system to understand the mental health crisis through data and research.\nThe idea for the initiative came around the time Gabel arrived at the university in 2019, when she consistently heard from students that they needed more mental health support.\n\"That was almost three years ago, and it has only worsened,\" Gabel said. Officials within the university system hope to develop a framework that can be replicated at other institutions.\n\"This isn't an area for competition. We want all our students to be successful,\" Gabel said. \"When students are well, particularly when their mental health is well, they persist better.\"\nLeaders at Marquette University are also trying to learn from the pandemic and the way it has affected students. Some of the measures installed in recent months, including efforts to train students to identify the signs of a mental health crisis in one another and deploying counselors into classrooms to share resources, have had a positive impact, Lovell said.\nOfficials also scattered mental health days throughout the semester, when classes are canceled and professors are discouraged from assigning work.\n\"It's really important for us to provide resources and tools for students so they don't get to that point where we're in crisis,\" Lovell said. \"The pandemic has really extenuated the pressures we feel to help students with mental health.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
