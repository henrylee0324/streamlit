Close to 70% of the incidents were against women. In a recent survey, NAPAWF found that nearly half of Asian American and Pacific Islander women have been affected by anti-Asian racism in the past two years.\nTHROUGH TRAGEDY, A TEACHABLE MOMENT \nCommunity advocates in Atlanta say they are prioritizing support for the victims' families and the community at large, and they explained those efforts at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\"Much of our focus is back towards the victims and their families and really what our communities need,\" Aisha Yaqoob Mahmood, executive director of the Asian American Advocacy Fund adding that legal services, mental health, and language support were needed.\nInstead of allowing a sympathetic narrative toward the perpetrator to dominate coverage, attention should focus on reporting stories from the community and about how this attack impacted the community, she said. \"We continue to bring the focus back to who are the most vulnerable in our communities, and working towards making sure that we can provide safety and security for us all.\"\nThe intersection of race, gender, and class colors the response and underlying assumption made about the worth of those killed, the organizers said, while the killing of six women in the course of their work also underscores the vulnerability of those in low-wage jobs.\n\"This is a gender and race based violence that happened to our community,\" said Leng Leng Chancey, Executive Director for 9to5, an organization focused on increasing economic security as well as political power and participation of working women.\nShe pointed to the challenges of dealing with sexual harassment and assault along with other institutional barriers. \"Low-wage workers already faced multiple hurdles and systemic racism every day,\" Chancey said. \"I mean, who can you really report this to?\"\nOrganizers said the events of this week, horrific as they were, can serve as teachable moments for how to discuss and cover violent attacks on marginalized communities, and the importance of listening to individuals from those communities.\nShortly after the attacks, the Asian American Journalists Association issued a guidance saying the use of \"massage parlor\" as a descriptor to describe the business establishments is outdated and reinforces negative stereotypes that hypersexualize and dehumanize Asian women.\nThe guidance also stressed the need to study the context within which Asian communities are experiencing and receiving this latest news, while acknowledging the diversity within the \"Asian community.\"\n\"The media needs to understand that the Asian community is not a monolith,\" Sarah Park, the president of the Atlanta chapter of the Korean American Coalition, said at Wednesday's press conference.\n\"We speak over hundreds of different languages.
