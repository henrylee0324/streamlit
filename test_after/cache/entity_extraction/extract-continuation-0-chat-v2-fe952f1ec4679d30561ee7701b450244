The Chinese man was heard on video calling their relationship a disgrace and saying they should date within their own race. \nMr Dave Parkash, 26, is of Indian-Filipino descent and his girlfriend Jacqueline Ho, 27, is half-Thai and half-Chinese Singaporean. The encounter was filmed by Ms Ho and made public by Mr Parkash, and rapidly went viral. \nThis came after an incident last month, when a Singaporean Indian woman out exercising with her face mask on that left her nose uncovered, was asked to wear her mask properly, and then reportedly kicked in her chest by a Chinese man uttering racial slurs. \nMany have spoken up against these incidents, which are being investigated by the police. \nWatching the latest video, I wondered what was on the Chinese man's mind when he accosted Mr Parkash thus in public. If you listen to his words, he appears to be making an assumption that many other Chinese Singaporeans will agree with him - that it is a disgrace to date outside one's race. \nWhat struck me was not his sentiment - many of us would have heard similar comments on social media, or from relatives and friends. What struck me was how such bigoted views, once privately expressed in closed groups, were being expressed in public. As Irish writer Oscar Wilde observed, hypocrisy is the compliment vice pays to virtue, so keeping mum on one's private bigoted views at least acknowledges the virtue of social norms that frown on the expression of such unsavoury views. \nThat the lecturer felt able to confront Mr Parkash publicly with his own bigoted views made me wonder if he felt others in society would agree with him. \nThat was what made me uncomfortable - the realisation that in Singapore, we may be creating a social environment where people think it is acceptable to mouth racist words and to chide those from minority communities for failing to conform to certain expectations. \nHome Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam, who has been quick to call out such racist incidents in the past, shared on his Facebook page: \"I used to believe that Singapore was moving in the right direction on racial tolerance and harmony. Based on recent events, I am not so sure anymore.\" \nAre things getting worse? If so, what has changed, and how did we get here? \nTHE 3CS: CECA AND COVID-19 AND CULTURE CLASH \nSeveral forces converge to expose existing fault lines on race. \nFirst is the Ceca factor. Short for the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, Ceca is a free trade agreement between Singapore and India that eases the movement of goods, services and people between the two countries, allowing for easier business travel and for intra-company transfers. It has been blamed for facilitating the entry of Indian migrants to compete for jobs with Singaporeans. \nSociological theories on racism include a view that racism springs from resource competition. In this view, prejudice towards another race is due to competitive pressure for jobs, status or political power. \nOne can construct an explanation for this quite easily: Indian skilled workers take away jobs from locals; they may even hire among their own kind (economic competition). \nStatus competition is complex and extends to all major races. The arrival of highly-skilled and high-income Indian nationals with superior attitudes and caste consciousness upsets other Indian Singaporeans who feel they are looked down upon by the new arrivals. \nThe Chinese may also feel threatened if this group takes jobs and leadership positions away from them, or outbids them in prime housing areas (economic competition). The new Indian immigrants who become citizens influence the vote (political competition). Meanwhile, the Malays may also feel threatened if the proportion of Indians in the national population rises, upsetting the long-established delicate demographic balance. \nIn short, having many Indian skilled immigrants risks upsetting segments of the Singapore-born population. People may then act out of their anxiety, allowing personal bigoted views free rein. Politicians who spout such views, and failure by others to call them out as racist, also help make such views mainstream. \nApart from Ceca fostering competition, the other factor fuelling racism is Covid-19. \nLiving in a global pandemic and being forced to adopt unnatural behaviours like social distancing and avoiding the workplace, while worrying over job and income loss, causes mental stress in many. \nIn May last year, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres alluded to this when he said \"the pandemic continues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering\" and urged governments to \"act now to strengthen the immunity of our societies against the virus of hate\". \nAcross the world, people stigmatise communities associated with each wave of Covid-19 infection. \nHate speech worldwide against Chinese and East Asians rose when the virus was described as the Wuhan or Chinese virus. Closer to home, anti-Muslim sentiments surfaced in Singapore online, when there was a surge of cases in Malaysia after large-scale religious gatherings there. \nIn Singapore in recent months, India and Indian nationals have been the target of online abuse as arrivals from India formed a growing proportion of imported cases, and as the Delta variant, which originated in India, became dominant here. \nWhile some Singaporeans think online trolls and negativity are harmless social ills, research shows that social media hate speech, when prolonged and insistent, can spark real-life acts of hate. \nIn March last year, Boston University researchers tracking hate speech and other malicious activity on social media platforms noticed a spike in the use of words like \"Chinese\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DAVE PARKASH<|>PERSON<|>Dave Parkash is a 26-year-old man of Indian-Filipino descent who was involved in a public incident regarding racism in Singapore.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACQUELINE HO<|>PERSON<|>Jacqueline Ho is a 27-year-old woman of half-Thai and half-Chinese Singaporean descent, who filmed the incident involving Dave Parkash.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K.
