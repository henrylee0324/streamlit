The way these two prominent cases are being reported in the press illuminates some of the holes in the new narrative of \"hate.\" \nStart with Mr. Elliot's brutal Midtown Manhattan beatdown of a 65-year old Filipina while shouting at her, \"You don't belong here.\" Mr. Elliot did this while out on lifetime parole for murdering his mother in 2002. Meanwhile in Atlanta, Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, has confessed to gunning down eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three area massage parlors. \nIn the dominant narrative, these attacks are but the latest manifestations of a system built for white supremacy. If Asian-Americans find themselves attacked, the Biden White House explains in a memo, it's because of pols who called Covid-19 names like \"Wuhan flu\" and thus \"stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes.\" \nAt best this narrative is highly misleading. Messrs. Elliot and Long are living examples why. \nStart with Mr. Long, who told police he shot up those massage parlors to remove sexual temptation. He denied he killed the women because they were Asian. Perhaps evidence to the contrary will appear, but as yet it hasn't. \nThat hasn't stopped almost every press report from lumping Atlanta in with all the other attacks deliberately targeting Asian- Americans, or from implying it's somehow Mr. Trump's fault, or both. A classic of the genre was a March 19 New York Times piece about the Atlanta killings under the headline \"Racism and Sexism Shadow Many Interactions for Asian-American Women.\" It checked all the boxes: \"racialized misogyny,\" \"the Trump administration repeatedly emphasized China's connection to the Covid-19 pandemic,\" \"capitalism based on racial exploitation\" even while conceding, much further down in the piece, that \"very little is \nknown about the motives of the Atlanta gunman.\" \nMeanwhile, the woke obsession with race and hate works to diminish both the crime and the specific facts surrounding it. Is the murder of eight innocent people any less heinous if the motivation wasn't race hatred? \nMr. Elliot's crime is an even tougher fit for the white-supremacy narrative because the 38-year-old attacker is African-American. What makes him particularly embarrassing is that his example raises the larger issue of black-on-Asian crime, which the narrative's champions are desperate to suppress or ignore. \nIn a thoughtful March 19 piece for the Weekly Dish on how debilitating this is for news coverage, Andrew Sullivan cites the Justice Department's 2019 Criminal Victimization report to note that \"of those committing violence against Asians, you discover that 24 percent such attacks are committed by whites; 24 percent are committed by fellow Asians, 7 percent by Hispanics; and 27.5 percent by African-Americans.\" \nFive days later, a Voice of America article put it this way: \"In New York City, where anti-Asian hate crime soared nearly nine-fold in 2020 over the year before, only two of the 20 people arrested last year in connection with these attacks were white, according to New York Police Department data analyzed by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. Eleven were African Americans, six were white Hispanics and one was a Black Hispanic.\" \nAssaults on Asian-Americans cannot easily be squeezed into a progressive narrative of white supremacy. Moreover, criminal attacks on Asian-Americans were going on long before Mr. Trump and Covid-19 arrived on the scene. \nAs for the Asian-American community, which is itself highly diverse, it is far from monolithic in its reaction. On one side, there are left- leaning outfits such as Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks hate incidents and appears all-in for the narrative. The outfit is the creation of other groups such as Chinese for Affirmative Action, one of the several Asian-American organizations to endorse Proposition 16, last year's failed ballot initiative to overturn California's ban on race preferences. \nOn the other side, there is a growing worry among Asian-Americans about what identity politics and the progressive narrative about race means for them. Last week some of these advocacy groups announced a new coalition, whose first demand is for the Biden Justice Department to reinstate the lawsuit against Yale for using race preferences to discriminate against Asian-American applicants -- another issue progressives would prefer to ignore. Rather than invocations of left-wing abstractions such as critical race theory, what these people want are common-sense protections that will keep them safe and free from discrimination. \n\"Asian Americans don't need narratives,\" says Linda Yang, director of Washington Asians for Equality. \"We need the truth. And we need the people who commit these terrible crimes to be condemned, prosecuted and properly identified -- no matter what race they are.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRANDON ELLIOT<|>PERSON<|>Brandon Elliot is a prominent figure involved in a brutal attack on a 65-year-old Filipina in Midtown Manhattan while on lifetime parole for murdering his mother in 2002.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>PERSON<|>Robert Aaron Long is a 21-year-old man who confessed to gunning down eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three massage parlors in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIDTOWN MANHATTAN<|>GEO<|>Midtown Manhattan is the location where Brandon Elliot attacked a 65-year-old Filipina.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the city where Robert Aaron Long committed a mass shooting at three massage parlors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIDEN WHITE HOUSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Biden White House is the current administration that has addressed the rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans in a memo.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a pandemic that has been linked to increased stigma and hate crimes against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an advocacy group that tracks hate incidents against Asian-Americans and supports the narrative of rising hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action is an organization that endorses Proposition 16 and is part of the coalition supporting Asian-American rights.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROPOSITION 16<|>EVENT<|>Proposition 16 was a failed ballot initiative in California aimed at overturning the ban on race preferences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINDA YANG<|>PERSON<|>Linda Yang is the director of Washington Asians for Equality, advocating for truth and justice regarding crimes against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRANDON ELLIOT<|>MIDTOWN MANHATTAN<|>Brandon Elliot committed a violent crime in Midtown Manhattan against a Filipina woman<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>ATLANTA<|>Robert Aaron Long committed a mass shooting in Atlanta, targeting individuals at massage parlors<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDEN WHITE HOUSE<|>COVID-19<|>The Biden White House has linked the rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated stigma<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>BIDEN WHITE HOUSE<|>Stop AAPI Hate supports the Biden White House's narrative regarding the increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action is one of the organizations that supports Stop AAPI Hate<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINDA YANG<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Linda Yang represents a perspective that contrasts with the narrative promoted by Stop AAPI Hate<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROPOSITION 16<|>CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION<|>Chinese for Affirmative Action endorsed Proposition 16, which aimed to change race preference policies<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
