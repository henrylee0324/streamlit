He saw someone attacking an Asian man and shouting \"go back to where you came from.\" \nThe attacker approached the Filipino man after his first victim escaped and punched him repeatedly. \n\"Go back to where you came from,\" the attacker allegedly shouted at the victim. \nThe man asked ABC 7 not to reveal his name or his face. He did however show his bloody face mask a proof of the attack. \nThis is the latest in a number of attacks against Asian Americans in New York City. In March, an Asian man was pushed onto the subway tracks in Queens, according to ABC 7. That same month, a Filipina woman was kicked and beaten outside an apartment building, The New York Times reports.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
