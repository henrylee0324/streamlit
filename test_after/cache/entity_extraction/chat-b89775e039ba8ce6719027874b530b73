As Cho has opened a new practice, she explained she is more cautious when hiring workers and considered whether to tint the windows. \n\"I'm more aware of the decisions I make because I know that just saying nothing and keeping quiet does not mean that I'm safe,\" Cho said. \"I've feared and wondered, could my picture or name affect my success?\" \nDespite slowed momentum and heightened fears, Asian American advocates new and old said they're focused on educating others and maintaining the coalitions that formed in the wake of the shootings. \nA rising battleground to increase Asian American visibility and reduce hate in the long term is K-12 schools, where a group of community members aim to implement Asian American history curriculum. Georgia Korean Chamber of Commerce Vice President of External Affairs Michelle Kang explained that fighting ignorance with education is a first step towards preventing hate. \n\"Asian Americans have been here since the 1850s, more than 170 years, but we're still considered as foreigners,\" Kang said. \"It's not right... It's not just white people's history.\" \nAllison Wang, a Chinese nurse who helped plan rallies after the shootings, said as hosting in-person events grew \"exhausting,\" making change in schools has become a new source of hope. Having grown up in Tucker without a single course that discussed Asian American experiences, Wang wants to make sure her daughter learns about her heritage.\n\"I am American, I've been naturalized to become an American citizen, but I'm also Chinese,\" Wang said. \"I would like to have more people ... who appreciate the fact that I am Asian. \nKang is hopeful increased awareness will help Asian communities from Lebanon to Vietnam \nmove forward. \n\"We are more vigilant about what's going on outside of the Korean American community,\" Kang said. \"We are watching out for each other.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
