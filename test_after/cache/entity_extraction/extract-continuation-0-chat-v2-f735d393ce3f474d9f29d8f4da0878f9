The 13-year-old, who is both Asian American and Black, was deeply hurt by the remark, which she says was made by someone she had considered to be a close friend at the time. \"I remember that day bawling to my mom,\" she said. \"We were just sitting there hugging each other and talking it out. We were just very emotional and it was a very sad night.\" \nOne in eight Asian Americans reported hate incidents in 2020, according to a national coalition battling the problem. And one in 10 reported anti-Asian hate incidents in the first quarter of 2021, including physical assaults, verbal harassment, civil rights violations and online harassment. \nIt's an issue that affects adults and children, according to the latest data from the San Francisco-based nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate. \nOf those who reported hate incidents in 2020, 16% came from Asian Americans ages 12 to 20. And about 80% of them reported being bullied or verbally harassed, often at school, Stop AAPI Hate found. \nRacism against people of Asian descent is an ongoing problem, \"but this pandemic, it has been more active,\" said Bogart, an eighth-grader at Metro Early College Middle School, a public STEM school on the Northwest Side. \"Since the pandemic, I feel like it's more blatant.' \nHate crimes against Asian-Americans overall reached an \"alarming level\" in the United States, according to an August report by the United Nations. More than 1,800 racist incidents against Asian Americans were reported from March to May. \nThe attacks included physical assaults, vandalism, verbal harassment, denial of access to services and public spaces, the report said. Victims also reported being spat on, blocked from public transportation, discriminated against in workplaces, shunned, beaten, stabbed, and insulted as transmitters of the coronavirus. \nIn March, a Georgia man went on a shooting spree at three Atlanta spas, killing eight people, including six Asian women, provoking fear in a community already feeling fearful and intimidated in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. \nA month earlier, a 61-year-old Filipino American was slashed across the face with a box cutter and left bleeding inside a New York City subway train as his assailant fled. \nAnd in late January, an 84-year-old Thai immigrant in San Francisco was violently shoved to the ground and died after what his family called an attack \"driven by hate\" and prosecutors said was horrific and senseless. \nWith the rise in hate incidents nationwide and the new school year less than a month away, many Asian American students in central Ohio are bracing for the potential of new or continued verbal assaults by fellow students when they return to school in the fall. \n\"I am obviously concerned about possible instances that could occur regarding my race,\" said Lou Cariello, who is Asian American. \nThe 17-year-old senior at Bexley High School chose to do her schooling remotely last year because of concerns about contracting COVID-19 and xenophobic comments by classmates about Asians and the origin of the virus. \n\"I was scared to even walk around my neighborhood with my dogs because I didn't want anyone to look at me as they were driving by or say something,\" she said. \nAbout 2% of Bexley school students are Asian American or Pacific Islander, according to the most recent data from the Ohio Department of Education. At Columbus City Schools, the state's largest district, the percentage is nearly 4%. \nCariello, who was adopted from China when she was a year old, remembers some students asking her racist questions even before the pandemic such as, 'Do you support eating dogs?', 'Why are you eating that weird food?' and 'Are you a communist?' \n\"I didn't want to imagine what it was going to be like if I went back to school in-person in the midst of everything going on,\" she said. \nShe currently plans to go back to school in person for her senior year and said she has a couple of teachers she feels comfortable confiding in if something were to happen. \nRacist incidents targeting Asian Americans occurred before COVID-19, but the pandemic increased the frequency and level of bullying, said Sharon Kim, a member of Ohio Progressive Asian Women's Leadership, a grassroots community group committed to empowering women of Asian and Pacific Islander descent. \n\"Being targeted because of someone's race or ethnicity or whatever difference, these are concerns that us parents have had even before the pandemic,\" she said. \"The sad fact of the matter is the pandemic ... just really increased the bullying that was already present.\" \nEven before their son Elliot was born, she and her husband worried about him being harassed and bullied because of his Asian ethnicity. \n\"It's not if it's going to happen, it's when it's going to happen,\" Kim said. \nElliot, now 5, is going to be a first-grader at Ecole Kenwood French Immersion Elementary School in Columbus City Schools. He recently told his mother, she said, how someone pulled back their eyes at him as part of a racist gesture in 2019 when he was in preschool. \n\"It's pretty heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It's just a reminder that this kind of racialized experience is already in his life experience as something that's probably going to happen again.\" \nThe pandemic has \"really shown how the world views Asian Americans and it's been incredibly disheartening,\" said Annie Johnson, a junior at Dublin Coffman High School. \nShe said schools should take action against students who make racist remarks. \n\"My race, my heritage, my culture is not a joke. It's not your punchline,\" said Johnson who is Asian American and white\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ABBY BOGART<|>PERSON<|>Abby Bogart is a 13-year-old Asian American and Black girl who experienced emotional distress due to racist remarks during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a national coalition that tracks and addresses hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is a U.S. state where a shooting spree occurred at three Atlanta spas, resulting in the deaths of eight people, including six Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is where a Filipino American was attacked with a box cutter on a subway train.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is where an 84-year-old Thai immigrant was violently attacked and died.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOU CARIELLO<|>PERSON<|>Lou Cariello is a 17-year-old Asian American senior at Bexley High School who expressed concerns about potential racist incidents when returning to school.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEXLEY HIGH SCHOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bexley High School is a public high school in Ohio where Lou Cariello is a senior.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLUMBUS CITY SCHOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Columbus City Schools is the largest school district in Ohio, with a significant percentage of Asian American students.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHARON KIM<|>PERSON<|>Sharon Kim is a member of Ohio Progressive Asian Women's Leadership, advocating for the empowerment of women of Asian and Pacific Islander descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECOLE KENWOOD FRENCH IMMERSION ELEMENTARY SCHOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ecole Kenwood French Immersion Elementary School is an elementary school in Columbus City Schools where Elliot, the son of Sharon Kim, will attend.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNIE JOHNSON<|>PERSON<|>Annie Johnson is a junior at Dublin Coffman High School who advocates for action against racist remarks in schools.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABBY BOGART<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Abby Bogart's experience with racism is part of the broader issue that Stop AAPI Hate addresses<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOU CARIELLO<|>BEXLEY HIGH SCHOOL<|>Lou Cariello is a senior at Bexley High School, where she is concerned about potential racist incidents<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHARON KIM<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Sharon Kim is involved in advocacy related to the issues that Stop AAPI Hate addresses<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOU CARIELLO<|>COLUMBUS CITY SCHOOLS<|>Lou Cariello is a student in the Columbus City Schools district<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ECOLE KENWOOD FRENCH IMMERSION ELEMENTARY SCHOOL<|>COLUMBUS CITY SCHOOLS<|>Ecole Kenwood is part of the Columbus City Schools district<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANNIE JOHNSON<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Annie Johnson's advocacy against racism aligns with the mission of Stop AAPI Hate<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGIA<|>ABBY BOGART<|>The shooting spree in Georgia is part of the broader context of hate incidents affecting Asian Americans, including Abby Bogart<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>ABBY BOGART<|>The attack in New York City is part of the broader context of hate incidents affecting Asian Americans, including Abby Bogart<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>ABBY BOGART<|>The violent attack in San Francisco is part of the broader context of hate incidents affecting Asian Americans, including Abby Bogart<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHARON KIM<|>LOU CARIELLO<|>Sharon Kim's advocacy relates to the concerns Lou Cariello has about racism<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
