We cannot expect our white friends, our Black friends and our Latino friends to have experienced the same things we've experienced.\"\nAnti-Asian crimes and incidents have spiked across the country over the last year as some leaders, including then-President Donald Trump, used inflammatory language to describe the coronavirus, which started in China. Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit social organization tracking incidents of discrimination, hate and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the U.S., reported 3,795 incidents from March 2020 to February of this year. Incidents ranged from shunning to vandalism to physical violence.\nCalifornia and New York led the nation with incidents, with 1,691 and 517 respectively, but Pennsylvania ranked fifth with \n97 reported incidents. According to U.S. Census data, the Lehigh Valley's Asian population stands at a little over 3%. Within that population are dozens of different ethnicities, many with their own languages and customs.\nBut though headlines across the country have kept them tense and vigilant, Asian American business owners and community leaders in the Lehigh Valley say they've felt fortunate to escape the wave of anti-Asian incidents and crimes.\nBut this doesn't mean these things don't happen, according to Mohan Seshadri, co-executive director for Pennsylvania's Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance. Historically, incidents like these are woefully underreported, he said, with issues like language barriers creating enormous hurdles.\nSome of the most harrowing incidents of anti-Asian crime have happened this year. Recent headlines include a New York City stabbing and a brutal robbery and beating in Oakland, California.\nBut the most horrifying incident so far is the March 16 shooting spree at Atlanta-area spas where eight people, six of Asian descent, were killed. Police have been criticized for reporting that alleged shooter Robert Long's claim that he lacked a racial motivation could absolve him of hate crimes.\nRacism directed at Asian people is nothing new in America, Seshadri said, but the rhetoric around COVID-19 created a convenient new scapegoat.\n\"The pandemic created this emotional response, and then to point those folks who are fired up at Asians, it was just going to lead to violence,\" he said. \"This was a very simple equation that I don't think anyone should have been surprised about.\"\nBryan Lu, of Bethlehem, is the son of Rakkii Ramen chef and founder Marco Lu, and he helps his father run the family's expanding Japanese noodle house business. Last March, when Lu heard Trump beginning to refer to COVID-19 as \"the Chinese virus\" and \"kung flu,\" he didn't think much of it.\n\"I didn't think people would take it literally,\" he said.\nBut it became clear that many did. Fortunately, Lu said, he spent most of the time reading about incidents elsewhere rather than seeing them play out in his own community.\n\"We're just thankful it didn't happen here,\" he said.\nLobynn Cha, owner of Little Miss Korea in the Allentown Fairground Farmers Market, said she and her family arrived in the U.S. when she was 9 and were quick to immerse themselves into the culture. She suspects her fluent English saves her from potential harassment, and though she's felt safe in the Valley, the recent attacks have her feeling less secure.\n\"I'm more vigilant these days for sure,\" Cha said. \"I wish people would see that we're all humans. We all came here from somewhere or another and we're all scared of COVID together.\"\nFor some, a sense of exasperation at years of turning the other cheek has set in. Jay Ho grew up in the Lehigh Valley and has taken over the family business, Ho Ho Incorporated, which includes Hunan Springs restaurant in Lower Macungie Township. He now spends most days at his new South Philadelphia restaurant Mei Mei, where he finds the camaraderie of other Asian restaurateurs refreshing.\n\"I know my parents didn't want any kind of altercation, but now it feels like we're easy targets,\" said Ho. \"There is a generational change with that mentality. We live here. We're as entitled to be here as anyone else.\"\nHo said Philly's support network of Asian neighborhoods is a far cry from the feeling of isolation he was accustomed to in the Lehigh Valley, where Asian Americans are scattered throughout the region.\nMark Cho, senior pastor at the Korean Church of the Lehigh Valley in Whitehall Township, tries to combat that sense of isolation among his congregation, encouraging them to reach out to one another.\n\"I preach and remind them, you are not alone,\" Cho said. \"We are in this together.\"\nCho said he encourages his parishioners to report incidents of anti-Asian bias, violence or vandalism to him if they do not feel comfortable turning to police. He's been relieved so far to see that it's not been a local problem, but Atlanta's violence has him bracing in a new way.\nHe hopes that people outside of the Asian community can understand how unsettling these incidents have been for so many.\n\"If your neighbor fears for their safety, that is not a good community,\" Cho said.\nThe solution to that, Chen\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
