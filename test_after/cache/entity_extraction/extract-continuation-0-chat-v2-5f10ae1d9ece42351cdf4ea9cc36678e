An investigation is in progress with the city's Central Detectives Division. \nBuu Ly, owner of Bar-Ly, which is located nearby, told WPVI-TV, \"When you see a grown person hitting a woman, it's just disturbing. It's very disturbing.\" \nHe added that the incident was upsetting due to the growing trend of anti-Asian attacks across the country. \nMark Squilla, a Democratic representative of the city's 1st District, said he has received growing reports about the lack of safety in the area. \n\"Get our streets back, so people feel safe again because, right now, they do not feel safe because they think the lawlessness is running rampant throughout the city,\" said Squilla. \nA Philadelphia Police Department crime map shows more than 388 crimes have been reported between Lombard Street and Race Street near Center City in the past 30 days. \nAdditionally, the rate of annual homicide victims was up 29% on April 5 compared to stats from the same date in 2020. The city reported 499 homicides throughout last year, and victim numbers have been growing annually since 2013. \nCrimes against Asian Americans spiked 150% throughout 2020, coinciding with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. \nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER \nThe first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, leading some high-profile people, including former President Donald Trump, to call it the \"China virus.\" \nPhoto Caption: Shown is a view of the Chinatown neighborhood of Philadelphia, Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2017.
