The requests all looked the same, and they would be familiar to any minority community dealing with tragedy.\nThe reporters she talked to almost seemed to follow a script – a script in search of pain. And when they couldn't find that, or her pain wasn't painful enough, they moved on.\nTao was being asked these questions because eight people had been killed in a series of shootings in and around Atlanta on Tuesday night. Six of the victims were women of Asian descent.\nIt was the kind of shocking violence that grabbed the nation's attention. Finally, America could see the kind of Asian racism that is often hidden away or underreported, even as former President Donald Trump seemed to revel in calling COVID-19 the \"Chinese virus.\"\nBut even with eight people dead, there was debate about whether the attack was a hate crime. About whether racism was the primary motive. About whether America was finally ready to stop Asian hate.\nTao was a journalist before immigrating to America, and she knows the truth is more complex than that. The truth is Tao was in San Francisco for her 20th wedding anniversary a few years ago when a woman kicked her luggage and told her to go back to her country.\nShe hasn't experienced overt racism like that in Cincinnati. But the truth is she often feels invisible here, which takes its own heavy toll. Because there is no Chinatown here, and stories of prejudice against Asian people often go untold.\nTao is a communications director for the Greater Cincinnati Chinese School in Butler County, and she founded the Greater Cincinnati Chinese Cultural Exchange Association. She is an advocate who knows Asian people are underrepresented in Cincinnati media, including The Enquirer.\nShe knows this because she is the one sending press releases that often go unanswered. And after the devastating attacks in Atlanta, the intense spotlight on Asian Americans only reinforces the lack of attention they are normally paid.\n\"We don't exist,\" Tao said.\n'People are scared'\nAcross the street from a sports bar in Silverton, the sign hangs in all capital letters: WANGLAW. In the window below, there is a poster: \"English is spoken here.\"\nStanding in the lobby looking out at the window, Charleston Wang says the poster helps keep white nationalists away. He laughs, but it's hard to tell if he's joking.\nAfter watching the news conferences about what happened on Tuesday, Wang looked up the definition of sex addiction. He did this because he felt confused and offended and sad as he watched a sheriff's spokesperson in Georgia answer questions about a possible motive for the attacks.\nThe suspect had denied any racial motivation, police said, and blamed the violence on his sexual addiction.\n\"Yesterday was a really bad day for him,\" the white police official said about the white suspect. \"And this is what he did.\"\nWang recites the deputy's name, Capt. Jay Baker, along with other details of the shootings almost 500 miles away. He slaps his hands on the maroon leather couch in his office.\n\"People are scared,\" he said.\nWang didn't know these women, but he has clients like them. Wang is an immigration lawyer who has represented dozens of spa workers. He's represented them after they've been sued for allegedly causing injury. He's represented them after they've fled their country. He's represented them trying to get married. And he's represented them after police stings.\nIn most cases, Wang said, they're vulnerable targets.\nHe throws his hands around, hitting the couch again. He's stressed. He's mad. He's a lot of things.\nHe is 65, and his hair is colored orange. On one side of the couch is a bowl of fake fruit, grapes and strawberries. On the other side is a large American flag.\nWang was born in Taiwan and lived in Malaysia before he came to America when he was 16. When he graduated from college, and his hair reached beyond his shoulders, his diploma credited Cheng-Kung Wang. When he passed the bar exam a few years later, he added another name to the certificate, which is framed in his office.\nCharleston.\nHe picked the name out of a hat.\nThis week, when Wang looked up the definition of sex addiction, he found research saying it is not an established psychiatric diagnosis. He found the American Psychiatric Association removed sex addiction from its guidebook of mental disorders in 2012.\nAnd as he watched the discussion surrounding the Atlanta killings, he couldn't help but think the deaths were being minimized. He couldn't help but feel like the victims were being blamed.\nIt hurt him, even though Wang doesn't feel persecuted in Cincinnati. Because the man with orange hair says he often feels invisible too.\n'Where are you really from?'\nFelicity Tao came to America when she was 25.\nShe left China with her husband, Mingyi Weng, to attend grad school. Her university was in a cornfield somewhere in Illinois. He was in Cincinnati. She always planned to return to China, and she did. She thought her husband would join her a few years later.\nBut he didn't want to leave. He loved Cincinnati. Compared to where they lived, Cincinnati was quiet.\nHe convinced her to come back. To leave their parents behind and start over. Because he felt this was the best place to raise their children.\nThere are times now, especially last year, when her husband felt like they made the wrong decision. Today, they both realize the American ideals they once believed in are more dreams than realities. The America they fantasized about, the one they saw in Hollywood movies, doesn't exist.\nThis is an America where, in Cincinnati, owners of a Chinese restaurant say their homes and cars have been egged. Where the restaurant receives calls daily telling them to \"go back to China.\" Where staff\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
