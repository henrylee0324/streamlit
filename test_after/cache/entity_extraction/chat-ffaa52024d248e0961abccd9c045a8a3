We may not always have all the correct information, and we may not even be accurate as to what was behind it, but I guess that really doesn't matter, as long as someone pays. \nAll right, so you're angry, join the club! I totally believe 100% of all Americans are angry regarding how the pandemic affected them for one reason or another. You have been sick, your family and friends have been sick, you were laid off, your business went under, or regrettably someone you loved died. All good reasons to be angry. \nSo who pays for your pain? Our nation is kind of at that point right now, where many people have picked out someone to vilify for COVID-19. And believe me, there are many targets to choose from. Of course, there's Donald Trump, who was president when the pandemic began. Then we can add former Vice President Mike Pence, who was Trump's pandemic point man. I'm quite sure most Americans have had enough of Dr. Fauci, who can't help changing his mind on a daily basis. Of course, President Biden's mask mandate was frustrating, and his COVID-19 relief package price was so astronomical, it may have actually crippled the restart of America's recovery. \nNeedless to say, the daily updates and recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were more confusing than Dr. Fauci's daily diatribe. And if you're a Minnesotan, Gov. Walz's lockdown, mandates and restart program would have more than tested the patience of Job. \nOr maybe we can blame the Chinese. After all, isn't China where the virus came from? But what if we don't know which Asian people we come in contact with are actually Chinese? After all, don't all Asian people look alike? Shouldn't all of them be punished for this indiscriminate virus? \nRegrettably, that's exactly what's happening across the world and in our own backyards. Asian people have become targets of opportunity for many angry people in America. NBC News reported 3,800 hate incidents between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021. That number is up from 2,600 incidents reported in that time period a \nyear ago. \nAn Asian American Pacific Islander advocacy organization reported 68% of the assaults happened to women, while 29% of victims were men, and 3% listed themselves as transgender or nonbinary. \nThese attacks include being spat upon, verbally abused, pushed, shoved, punched, or thrown to the ground, or refusing to give them service in a store. However, some people have taken it to a sadistic level. The BBC reports a Chinese woman was slapped in the face before being set on fire. An elderly Thai man was killed when he was violently thrown to the ground. \nSorrily this is not the first time Asian people have been singled out for oppression and violence in the United States. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the government systematically rounded up people of Japanese descent, placing 120,000 of them in confinement camps for nearly four years, fearing they would attack America from within. \nWhat everyone needs to realize is that every Asian American in our country has also suffered through the ravages of COVID-19 just as we all have. If anyone can actually attempt to justify these abhorrent attacks, you truly need to look into your soul and figure out who you really are. \nGerry Feld writes about issues from a conservative perspective and is a published novelist.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
