On Juneteenth, the CHOP observed a \"Black out.\" Organizers at Every Day March, often lead gratitude exercises before their morning protests. \nThe Saturday following the anti-Asian hate crime that killed six Asian women in Atlanta, GA, the youth organizers put together a virtual vigil and healing session. \nAnother lesson the youth organizers have learned from the BLM protests is momentum. Despite dwindling media attention, Seattle's daily protests for Black lives continued well into the fall. \nAfter their Hing Hay Park protest, the youth-led movement continued throughout the King County area with action in Maple Valley, Renton, Kent, Newcastle, Bellevue, Burien, and Tukwila all slated before March 22. According to Huang, the turn out of these smaller rallies was still \"solid\" with the support of 30 to 40 community members and even some interest from local leadership. \nThe youth coordinators still meet multi-times a week to plan their next action items. Following the week of rallies, Huang hosted a Zoom training session to teach strategies for civic engagement, specifically how to call local representatives and demand they issue proclamations condemning hate. Huang says there is much more in the works. \n\"I don't think there's ever any point we should say we are done,\" Magana said. \"As long as there is anti-Asian sentiment, there is always something to stand up for.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The CHOP is an organization that observed a \"Black out\" on Juneteenth, promoting racial equity for the Black community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVERY DAY MARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Every Day March is an organization that leads gratitude exercises before morning protests for racial equity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZEL HUANG<|>PERSON<|>Huang is a youth organizer who hosted a Zoom training session on civic engagement strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAGANA<|>PERSON<|>Magana is a youth organizer who emphasizes the importance of ongoing activism against anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING COUNTY<|>GEO<|>King County is the area where youth-led protests for Black lives continued throughout the fall.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the city where an anti-Asian hate crime occurred, resulting in the death of six Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPLE VALLEY<|>GEO<|>Maple Valley is one of the locations in King County where protests were slated to occur.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENTON<|>GEO<|>Renton is one of the locations in King County where protests were slated to occur.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KENT<|>GEO<|>Kent is one of the locations in King County where protests were slated to occur.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEWCASTLE<|>GEO<|>Newcastle is one of the locations in King County where protests were slated to occur.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLEVUE<|>GEO<|>Bellevue is one of the locations in King County where protests were slated to occur.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURIEN<|>GEO<|>Burien is one of the locations in King County where protests were slated to occur.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TUKWILA<|>GEO<|>Tukwila is one of the locations in King County where protests were slated to occur.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUAL VIGIL<|>EVENT<|>A virtual vigil and healing session organized by youth following the anti-Asian hate crime in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAZEL HUANG<|>EVERY DAY MARCH<|>Huang is involved with Every Day March, leading gratitude exercises before protests<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAZEL HUANG<|>KING COUNTY<|>Huang organizes protests in King County, contributing to the youth-led movement<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAGANA<|>HAZEL HUANG<|>Magana and Huang are both youth organizers involved in ongoing activism<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHOP<|>KING COUNTY<|>The CHOP organizes events in King County to promote racial equity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVERY DAY MARCH<|>KING COUNTY<|>Every Day March organizes protests in King County for racial equity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>VIRTUAL VIGIL<|>The virtual vigil was organized in response to the anti-Asian hate crime that occurred in Atlanta<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING COUNTY<|>MAPLE VALLEY<|>Protests are slated to occur in Maple Valley, which is part of King County<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING COUNTY<|>RENTON<|>Protests are slated to occur in Renton, which is part of King County<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING COUNTY<|>KENT<|>Protests are slated to occur in Kent, which is part of King County<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING COUNTY<|>NEWCASTLE<|>Protests are slated to occur in Newcastle, which is part of King County<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING COUNTY<|>BELLEVUE<|>Protests are slated to occur in Bellevue, which is part of King County<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING COUNTY<|>BURIEN<|>Protests are slated to occur in Burien, which is part of King County<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING COUNTY<|>TUKWILA<|>Protests are slated to occur in Tukwila, which is part of King County<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
