We pay taxes. We work here. This is our life,\" said Mr. Zheng, who has been in the U.S. for 10 years and lives in suburban Atlanta with his wife and two children. \"This is a country of immigrants, all of the immigrants, so there is nothing we can do better than love each other, than work together.\"\nEight people, including six women of Asian descent, were killed in shootings at three Atlanta-area spas on Tuesday night. Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Ga., was arrested in the attacks and has been charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, officials said. He is being held in Cherokee County without bond. He waived his right to an attorney, officials said.\nThe fact that six of the eight victims were women of Asian descent has prompted calls for the suspect to be charged with hate crimes.\nLaw-enforcement officials in the suburban county where the first shooting occurred have said that Mr. Long told them he was lashing out at his sexual addiction in the attacks. Officials with the Atlanta Police Department said they still were investigating the attacks to determine whether Mr. Long should be charged with hate crimes.\nIn New York City, hundreds of people gathered in Manhattan's Union Square on Sunday for a solidarity march to the borough's Chinatown neighborhood.\nShuangye Zhu, a 28-year-old preschool teacher in Queens, held a sign saying \"Hate is Virus\" as the names of the Atlanta shooting victims were read aloud at the demonstration. She said the attacks have left some of her co-workers scared to take public transportation.\n\"We're here because we feel so bad about it,\" Ms. Zhu said of attending the march.\nOn Saturday, hundreds of protesters gathered in Times Square to march to Manhattan's Chinatown.\nWayne Huang, 42, who was born in New York City and lives in Chinatown, brought his two boys to the demonstration. He said his children were attending their first march.\n\"It's hard to explain the hate to them, and the evil, but they have to have that awareness that it is time to support the community,\" Mr. Huang said.\nPolice and government officials in New York City and other U.S. cities have said hate crimes against Asian Americans have risen since the Covid-19 pandemic, which was first identified in China. Hunter Huang joined his father, Wayne Huang, for a march from Times Square to Chinatown in Manhattan on Saturday. PHOTO: Alex Janin/The Wall Street Journal\nChristopher Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told NPR last week that while the spa shootings are still under investigation, \"it does not appear that the motive was racially motivated.\"\nSen. Tammy Duckworth (D., Ill.) said Sunday she has urged the heads of the Justice Department and the FBI to look into whether hate crimes against Asian-Americans have been underreported.\n\"I want to see a deeper investigation into whether or not these shootings and other similar crimes are racially motivated,\" Ms. Duckworth said on CBS News's \"Face the Nation.\"\nRep. Judy Chu (D., Calif.), who heads the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said Sunday that she is pushing for legislation to improve the reporting of hate crimes. She said on ABC News's \"This Week\" that 18 states don't track hate crimes and three states don't have a hate-crime statute in the law.\n\"Our reporting is very flawed, because it relies on local law enforcement agencies to voluntarily provide such statistics,\" Ms. Chu said.\nPresident Biden on Friday met with Asian-American leaders in Atlanta and urged Congress to pass the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act. The legislation would expedite Justice Department reviews of race-related crimes linked to Covid-19. Mr. Biden also called on the Senate to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.\nHeidi Ng, a 28-year-old college budget officer, was one of hundreds of people who gathered in San Francisco's Chinatown on Saturday.\nMs. Ng, who was holding a sign saying \"Love us like u love our food,\" said she was fed up by the recent attacks.\n\"They remind me that the next person could possibly be one of my family members; it could be my mom,\" she said.\nKate Dang, 27, of Atlanta, said she came to the rally near the Georgia State Capitol on Saturday because the spa shootings were an extreme example of a general disregard people have shown toward Asian-American women.\n\"Misogyny and racism tend to go hand in hand,\" she said.\nMs. Dang attended the rally with her friend, Fei Li, 33, also of Atlanta. Both said that in the past year anti-Asian attitudes in the U.S. have grown worse, fueled by societal worries about the Covid-19 pandemic and remarks by former President Donald Trump, who they said exacerbated anti-Asian prejudice by blaming China for the spread of virus and referring to the virus as \"kung flu.\" Civil-rights groups have said the term was a racial slur.\n\"He wasn't the sole factor, but he was a huge factor,\" Ms. Li said of Mr. Trump.\nSpokespeople for Mr. Trump didn't respond to a request for comment. Former White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany previously has said Mr. Trump wasn't being offensive when he referred to the virus\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL<|>GEO<|>The Georgia State Capitol is a location where protests and vigils were held calling for an end to violence against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN-AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian-Americans are individuals of Asian descent living in the United States, who have been targeted in recent hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XIAOXU ZHENG<|>PERSON<|>Xiaoxu Zheng is a 36-year-old medical researcher at Georgia State University who attended a protest against anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>PERSON<|>Robert Aaron Long is the suspect arrested for the shootings at Atlanta-area spas, charged with multiple counts of murder.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA-AREA SPAS<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta-area spas were the sites of deadly shootings that resulted in the deaths of eight individuals, including six women of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHUANGYE ZHU<|>PERSON<|>Shuangye Zhu is a 28-year-old preschool teacher who participated in a solidarity march in response to the Atlanta shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAYNE HUANG<|>PERSON<|>Wayne Huang is a 42-year-old resident of Chinatown in New York City who brought his children to a demonstration against anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HATE CRIMES<|>EVENT<|>Hate crimes against Asian-Americans have increased, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, prompting protests and calls for better tracking.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMMY DUCKWORTH<|>PERSON<|>Senator Tammy Duckworth is advocating for a deeper investigation into hate crimes against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUDY CHU<|>PERSON<|>Representative Judy Chu is pushing for legislation to improve the reporting of hate crimes in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>EVENT<|>The Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act is legislation aimed at expediting Justice Department reviews of race-related crimes linked to the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRESIDENT BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>President Biden met with Asian-American leaders in Atlanta to discuss the rise in hate crimes and urged Congress to pass the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATE DANG<|>PERSON<|>Kate Dang is a 27-year-old individual from Atlanta who attended a rally against anti-Asian violence following the spa shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEI LI<|>PERSON<|>Fei Li is a 33-year-old friend of Kate Dang who also attended the rally in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Former President Donald Trump has been criticized for his remarks that some believe have exacerbated anti-Asian prejudice.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOXU ZHENG<|>GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL<|>Xiaoxu Zheng attended a protest at the Georgia State Capitol against violence towards Asian-Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>ATLANTA-AREA SPAS<|>Robert Aaron Long is the suspect in the shootings that occurred at the Atlanta-area spas<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHUANGYE ZHU<|>HATE CRIMES<|>Shuangye Zhu participated in a march in response to the rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAYNE HUANG<|>HATE CRIMES<|>Wayne Huang brought his children to a demonstration against hate crimes targeting Asian-Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAMMY DUCKWORTH<|>HATE CRIMES<|>Tammy Duckworth is advocating for investigations into hate crimes against Asian-Americans<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUDY CHU<|>HATE CRIMES<|>Judy Chu is pushing for legislation to improve hate crime reporting in the U.S.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRESIDENT BIDEN<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>President Biden urged Congress to pass the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act to address hate crimes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATE DANG<|>HATE CRIMES<|>Kate Dang attended a rally against anti-Asian violence in response to the spa shootings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEI LI<|>KATE DANG<|>Fei Li attended the rally with her friend Kate Dang<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>HATE CRIMES<|>Donald Trump's remarks have been linked to an increase in anti-Asian prejudice<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
