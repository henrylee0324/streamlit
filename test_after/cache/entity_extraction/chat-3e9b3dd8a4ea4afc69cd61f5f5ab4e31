Grace Meng remembers the slurs and name-calling she and her fellow Asian Americans occasionally endured on the playgrounds of New York.\n“It was just something we grew up with” said Meng who is now in her 40s. “We were taught to mind our own business not to rock the boat. But what’s changed for my generation – even before the tragedy in Atlanta – is that people like me were starting to see people who look like their fathers and mothers and grandfathers getting beaten up. That really struck a nerve.”\nAcross the nation such attacks part of a rising wave of anti-Asian incidents over the past year have shocked many Asian Americans. The March 16 slaying of eight people at three Atlanta spas six of them Asian women has further sparked both a sense of heightened activism from within the Asian American community and broad-based support from beyond.\nThe moment seems rich with opportunity. What’s to be done with this solidarity? For Asian American community leaders and activists the answers range from creating better ballot access and greater political representation expanding Asian American history instruction in schools and emboldening activist participation from untapped groups such as youth and the greater religious community. \n“It’s really important and meaningful that we have had such widespread support from all over the country” Meng said. “As an Asian American born and raised here I have never felt that in my entire life. We need to make the most of this moment.”\nAnti-Asian sentiment has grown significantly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic with many in the community citing the disparaging rhetoric of the Trump administration as a factor. San Francisco-based Stop AAPI Hate which tracks discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders tallied nearly 3800 such incidents from March 2020 through February 2021.\nMore recently results of an annual survey conducted by the Anti-Defamation League showed that Asian Americans had suffered the largest spike in severe incidents of hate and harassment online.\nThroughout the United States and in Canada this weekend #StopAsianHate marches were scheduled as a response to such sentiments in places like Princeton New Jersey; Buffalo New York; Portland Maine; and Calgary Alberta.\nThe activism extends beyond the streets. Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth threatened Tuesday to vote against white nominees to President Joe Biden’s administration until more Asian Americans were appointed to high-ranking roles then withdrew that threat after she received assurances the White House would do better. While Vice President Kamala Harris is of Indian descent there are no Cabinet secretaries of Asian American or Pacific Islander descent in Biden's administration despite the president's pledge to reflect the nation's diversity.\nThis weekend U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia a member of the Congressional Black Caucus was set to host a virtual conversation for the public on anti-Asian discrimination and violence with Meng and U.S. Rep. Judy Chu of California. The event will be broadcast on Zoom and on Johnson's Facebook page.\n“One of the interesting things I’ve been hearing is that this is the first time that Asian Americans have being asked to share their stories in their workplaces” said Aarti Kohli executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Asian Law Caucus a national legal advocacy group. “And people are often surprised to hear the racism that their colleagues have faced. So I'm seeing a much broader recognition of the racism that has been aimed at our community.”\nFrank Wu president of Queens College City University of New York compares the moment to the mood following the 1982 killing in Detroit of Vincent Chin a Chinese American mistaken for Japanese by two struggling auto workers who beat him to death with a baseball bat. The two were eventually fined $3000 and sentenced to probation.\nThe resulting outrage and subsequent sense of solidarity Wu said crossed lines of ethnicity generation language and class and prompted renewed Asian American civil-rights activism. But like all movements it eventually lost momentum.\nSo while many Black Latino and Jewish leaders and colleagues have reached out to him in unprecedented partnership since the Atlanta killings it’s crucial Wu said to capitalize on that unity while it lasts.\n“Out of this tragedy” he said “there is something I always hoped for but hadn’t seen until now: Real bridge-building intentions.\"Stopping Asian hate with data and education\nMaking the most of the current energy was the thinking behind a “National Day of Action and Healing” a virtual conversation conducted by Chu Friday with fellow legislators activists and victims of anti-Asian attacks.\n“We wanted to give people a tool to share with their co-workers their bosses their neighbors” Meng said. “We’re hopeful it can be a spark for creating long-term partnerships. That’s the immediate next step – to have this continue.”\nAmong the long-term solutions Meng said she’d like to see is for Americans to better understand each others’ histories and contributions – with public education being one way to do that.\n“Think about what we learned in school about the contributions of Asian Americans to American history” she said. “Just a paragraph. I think we can make the most of this moment to expand the curriculum we’re teaching our kids.”\nStop AAPI Hate has likewise advocated for ethnic studies curricula as a means to curtail bullying as well as community-based violence protection programs to protect the elderly and the expansion of civil rights protections to end harassment in business.\n“I look forward to seeing this movement continue to grow” said Russell Jeung the group’s co-founder and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University.\nChu is also among those pushing two hate-related bills for Congressional approval the No Hate Act and the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act both meant to improve tracking of hate crimes.\n“These are things that should have been improved a long time ago” Chu said noting that the FBI relies on individual states to submit their hate-crime data “which means that many don’t report anything. Eighteen states don’t have a mandate and three states don’t even have a hate crime statute. We need to have change there on a national basis.”\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
