Rape was common around military bases, she said, including among young girls.\n\"The local governments often had limited access to punish the service people, and often had an incentive to hush it up because so much rides on the continuation of American service people putting their money into these local communities via the bodies of these sex workers,\" Oda said.\nWhen the U.S. drew back its troops, some of those women who operated sex parlors in their home countries immigrated to the U.S. and opened massage parlors, Oda said.\n\"It kind of helped to establish the idea of Asian women as desirable, but also willing and available, particularly to white American men,\" Oda said, adding many scholars found some massage parlors were rooted in camp towns.\nSome operate legally, she said, but others allow women to work under the table.\nAnti-Asian sentiments in Nevada\nKoo, with One APIA Nevada, said understanding the history of the Asian-American communities is critical, particularly now.\nKoo referenced the transcontinental railroad that connects Reno to Sacramento, which Chinese migrant workers helped build.\n\"The safety conditions of a lot of the workers were not very good,\" Koo said. \"After they completed the transcontinental railroad ... a lot of these Chinese laborers were kind of left to their own devices.\n\"And we actually saw a really vibrant Chinatown grow in Reno from the late 1800s to the early 1900s,\" she said.\nBut in the early 1900s, Chinatown was declared as a physical and moral threat, and the entire thing was demolished.\n\"That wasn't even the first time that Chinatown had been destroyed,\" Koo said. \"I believe in 1878, it had also been burned down by people who didn't want it there.\"\nOda said the Trump Administration also helped create an anti-Asian American sentiment by referring to COVID-19 as the \"China flu,\" the \"Kung flu\" or the \"Wuhan virus.\"\n\"It takes different shapes at different times, but this undercurrent very much has its roots,\" Oda said. \"There is definitely a racial and gender component to this, whether or not the police wish to acknowledge that.\"\nSetting a foundation\nOda said she believes that the Black Lives Matter movement laid down a foundation that's helping spread awareness of racial inequalities, discrimination and racism outside of the Black community.\nShe also acknowledged the Latinx communities, which have been organizing to fight the criminalization of migrants.\n\"I think it's allowed people more broadly to be amenable to the idea that Asian-Americans also face systematic racism,\" Oda said. \"It looks different to anti-Black or anti-Latinx bias, but nonetheless, there is a structural kind of anti-Asian sentiment there.\"\nKoo said acknowledging hate crimes when they happen is important because many of those communities are hurting.\n\"There was a sense of understanding that we can't keep quiet anymore,\" she said.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
