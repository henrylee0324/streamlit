Racist attacks, some verbal and some physical, were reported in cities like Alhambra and New York with large Asian populations and Muskegon with few Asian residents. \nThe attacks took place in schools, restaurants, stores, subways, sidewalks, fitness classes and Zoom meetings. Some involved allegations about the coronavirus, while other perpetrators used age-old racial slurs like \"ching chong.\" \nSome victims were elderly, others children. Some were coughed on or spat on, some slapped or hit, some refused service at businesses, still others stung by racist words or by people declining to interact with them. \nThe incidents were reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a group formed in March 2020 in response to attacks related to the perception that Asians were responsible for the coronavirus because of its origins in Wuhan, China. \nThe new study builds on a previous one released two months ago. \nIn March, people around the country reported more than 2,800 anti-Asian hate incidents to Stop AAPI Hate. In the entire year before that, the group received about 3,800 reports of racial incidents. \nThe sudden surge could be due in part to greater awareness that Stop AAPI Hate, founded by a coalition of Asian American advocacy groups, is collecting reports about racist incidents. But law enforcement agencies around the country are also seeing a large increase in reported anti-Asian hate crimes. \nNew York saw the greatest increase, at 223%, followed by 140% in San Francisco and 80% in Los Angeles, in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year, according to a report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino. \nHate crimes are attacks on people or property motivated by race, gender or other protected characteristics. Hate incidents involve name calling or insults but do not rise to the level of a crime. \nThe Stop AAPI Hate study includes both types of situations. Nearly two-thirds of the more than 6,600 anti-Asian incidents reported from last March to this March involved verbal harassment. About 18% involved shunning -- people deliberately avoiding Asian Americans and 13% were physical assaults. \nCivil rights violations such as workplace discrimination and being refused service at a business were 10%. Online harassment was 7%. \nOn its website, the group accepts reports in 10 Asian languages, including Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and Tagalog, in addition to English. \n\"Racism against Asian Americans is systemic and long-standing,\" said Russell Jeung, cofounder of Stop AAPI Hate and professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University. \n\"The more we draw attention to anti-Asian hate, the more Asian Americans know they have a place to report what they're experiencing, and the more we can demonstrate the extent of the problem and advocate for meaningful solutions.\" \nIn some instances, attackers say nothing explicitly racist, but victims feel targeted because of their race. \nShelley Nguyen, 48, reported a series of incidents to Stop AAPI Hate last summer. \nA white woman repeatedly accosted her at a San Francisco park, demanding that she cover her face while jogging, then erupting into curses and insults, said Nguyen, a physician who is Vietnamese American. \nOne time, the woman removed her neck gaiter and coughed on Nguyen, her husband and daughter, telling the child: \"Geez, kid, I'm sorry your mom is such a b--.\" \nJasmine Li, a Chinese American from Aliso Viejo, said her 10-year-old daughter was waiting for a ride home from school in October when four or five boys asked: \"Why are you here? Are you sick? Do you have COVID?\" \nLater, a larger group of students, including the ones who had taunted her earlier, started chanting \"Corona, Corona, Corona,\" when the child walked past them on her way to the school's front office. \nLi, an information technology specialist, said she and her husband had heard about racist incidents throughout the pandemic and were worried their daughter would face further attacks. \nShe immediately reported what happened to the principal. \n\"This is not right,\" she said. \"Children should not be picked on, and thank goodness my daughter is too young to be able to tell what type of things are racially motivated, but we still need to protect her.\" \nCaption: PHOTO: THAI AMERICANS are joined by political leaders and law enforcement at an L.A. rally against hate.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
