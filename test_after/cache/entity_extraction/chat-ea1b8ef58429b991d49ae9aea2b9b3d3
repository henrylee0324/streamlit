The sickening beating on Friday night in Harlem was as sadistic and unprovoked as any we have seen. \nIn my building, women of Asian appearance now are afraid to go out to buy groceries and are turning to volunteer group, SafeWalx, which offers walking companions to the Asian community. \nThis is no way to live. But it's what happens when foolish politicians demonise, defund and disempower the NYPD, while mollycoddling criminals and racial justice warriors who abuse police for sport. No wonder cops are quitting in droves. \nAs anti-police protests escalate, and violent crime spirals out of control, a mass exodus is under way from police forces across the country. \nMore than 5300 NYPD officers have retired or quit this year, the New York Post reported on the weekend, a 75 per cent increase from last year. \nThey should find easier work as private security for the wealthy woke, who are insulated from the consequences of their own virtue. \nDaily Telegraph - News Feed latest episode \nBut never fear, New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson has a plan to make things worse. \nOn the weekend he announced the city's latest tranche of anti-cop legislation. \nJohnson wants former NYPD officers permanently banned from taking other law enforcement jobs if they have been subject to disciplinary action. \nJohnson made his announcement at Reverend Al Sharpton's Harlem headquarters, a few blocks from where Yao Pan Ma now lies in a coma. \nHe offered no words of comfort to Ma's wife and no solutions to the violent crime epidemic. \nWhat does he care? He has an eight-cop security detail. \nNAT - Stay Informed - Social Media\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
