A coalition of civil rights groups estimated more than 2,100 incidents.\nIn Midland, Texas an Asian family including two young children were stabbed at a Sam’s. The assailant was\ncaptured and said he stabbed them because he thought they were spreading Coronavirus. The Asian family\nwas not even Chinese.\nA Filipina nurse tearfully reported that after working 18 hours straight in a hospital’s emergency room, shestopped at a grocery store to buy some essentials and was greeted by a couple of old ladies shouting anti-\nAsian slurs. The Filipina nurse is fair-skinned with Chinese facial features.Closer to home, a diminutive 77-year-old Filipina who is a charter board member of the Philippine American\nChamber of Commerce in North Texas was denied service at a local QT grocery store and was given the dirty\nlook by the clerk who was mumbling racist words.\nThe feisty senior citizen who is a martial arts aficionada held her ground and was ready for anything untoward.\nIt was her burly and outspoken\nAmerican husband who confronted the clerk and strongly put him in his place.\nMeanwhile, a story went viral about a 75-year-old Chinese woman in San Francisco who fought back and sent\nher assailant to the hospital.\nStories circulated around New Year 2021, some captured on video, about elderly Filipinos and other Asians\nactually being assaulted on San Francisco and New York streets.\nA 91-year-old Thai retiree in Oakland was assaulted during his morning walk and killed. A Filipino’s face was\nslashed in a subway station. All for no\nreason except a mistaken belief that the Chinese brought COVID-19 to the U.S. And it didn’t matter that many\nof those assaulted were not even Chinese.\nIs this American enough?\nIt also didn’t matter if the victims of anti-Asian hatred were born and raised in the U.S. and served heroically\nin the military. CNN showed 78-year-old Lee Wong, a war veteran and Purple Heart recipient who came to the\nU.S. as a child, giving an impassioned speech in a town hall meeting. He tearfully\nshared that when people looked at him with accusing eyes, he told them he is an American.\nAnd some would say “You are not American enough, you are not patriotic enough!” So, at the town hall\nmeeting he took off his shirt and showed everyone the scars that covered his entire body caused by 6 enemy\nbullets that pierced his body during the Vietnam War. And he declared: “Is this American enough?” “Is this\npatriotic enough?”\nAsian Americans do not deserve the xenophobic and bigoted attacks against them that are spiking in America,\nfalsely attributing to them the origin and meteoric spread of Coronavirus. Asian Americans are also\nvictims of the pandemic. And hundreds of thousands of Asian American medical professionals and hospital\nworkers who risk their own lives saving COVID-19 victims are heroes who deserve to be thanked and\ncongratulated, not hated.\nThe “Model Silent Minority Community”, discriminated for a century, now lives in fear\nThere are 575,000 Asian businesses in the U.S. that feel threatened. The scapegoating is\nreminiscent of old racist tropes that led to the discrimination of Asian immigrants in the U.S. – from\nthe quarantining of San Francisco’s Chinatown during the bubonic plague of the 1900s, to the\nrounding up of Japanese Americans in internment camps during WWII, to the traditional\ndiscrimination in visa quota allocation against Asians by the U.S. Immigration Service over the\nyears.\nIt did not help that historically, hardworking Asians have been the subject of scorn and jealousy as\nAmerica’s “silent model minority community” with the highest per capita income and the highest\neducation level in the U.S. among immigrant groups and the least chances of getting into trouble\nwith the law.\nAsian-Americans are builders, not destroyers\nA former President of the United States once said that if Asian American doctors and nurses\n(particularly Filipinos, Indians, Chinese and Korean) would leave the country, the entire American\nhealth system will collapse.\nUnbeknownst to many mainstream Americans especially the younger generations, Asian Americans\nhave played a significant role in the building of this country and to its supremacy as the most\neconomically powerful nation on earth.\nNotable Americans of Asian descent have been responsible for the country’s global leadership in\nhigh technology and modern sciences. Among these are the Asian-American CEOs or cofounders of\nFortune 500 companies such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Master Card, You Tube, Hotmail,\nNVidia, FitBit, Adobe, Pepsico and many others. It was also an Asian American scientist who\ndiscovered the cure for the Ebola virus and is busy at work on potential cure for COVID-19.\nAsian Americans are typically soft-spoken and humble to a fault. The many thousands of Asian\nmedical professionals will never flaunt their own personal sacrifices as front-liners and willing\nwarriors in the war against the deadly Coronavirus. Asian business and technical professionals\nsuch as\nengineers, scientists, architects, accountants, educators\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
