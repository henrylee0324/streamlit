They talk about being scared to go outside to exercise or head to work. Small business owners are closing shop earlier and earlier.\n\"We've got to work together to stop the crime, to stop the violence and stop the anti-Asian hate crime,\" Liu said. \"In the past year, there is increasing number of hate crimes and criminal activities and killing, which (is) not only a threat to our safety, life, but also mental health.\"\nLiu and other Chinatown community members called the gathering following Tuesday evening's shootings across two spas in Atlanta and one in its suburbs. The attack, they said, is the latest assault on Asian American people in the U.S. during a chilling year of heightened violence against them. Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, has been charged with murder in their deaths.\nAld. Byron Sigcho-Lopez, 25th, said since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, which was first identified in China and former President Donald Trump referred to as the \"China virus,\" members of the Asian American community have faced increased racism. But anti-Asian prejudice isn't new either, he said. Now, as people are finally listening, Chicago and the rest of the U.S. must come together to condemn what he described as an \"act of terrorism.\"\n\"This is an issue that has been affecting the Asian American community for a long time,\" Sigcho-Lopez said. \"These are the consequences of the dehumanization here of people of color, and that's across the board, ... Asian Americans, Black and brown women of color and residents who have been feeling targeted. And I think the big issue here that we need to speak about is white supremacy.\"\nHis comments echo Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Wednesday remarks that \"this wasn't anything random, that it was intentional, and it feels to me, as a former member of law enforcement, like a hate crime.\" Authorities in Georgia sparked outrage on Wednesday when they announced the alleged gunman's actions were not racially motivated and stemmed from a sex addiction.\nA national coalition of Asian American organizations recorded 3,795 racist incidents against Asians from March 2020 to February in the U.S., 92 of them in Illinois, according to its latest report. Almost 70% of the reports came from Asian women.\nDavid Wu, executive director of the educational Pui Tak Center, said the students of his English language classes see themselves in the victims of the spa shootings. They are immigrants who work in restaurants and nail salons, who have toiled late hours to provide for their families. And amid the pandemic, they have felt like scapegoats for the coronavirus, Wu said.\n\"Our students feel very traumatized right now,\" Wu said. \"They come to America hoping for new life, and especially during the pandemic they've been faced with racist incidents. ... Whether or not they've been a victim of crime, many of them feel just the shame of being targeted by others.\"\nChicago police 9th District Cmdr. Don Jerome said there has been no overall recent uptick in reported crimes against Asian people, but sometimes residents of communities such as Chinatown don't feel comfortable reporting to the police. Lightfoot announced on Wednesday that Chicago police units would step up patrols in Asian American communities such as Chinatown.\n\"It appears from what I've seen that he did target Asian Americans,\" Jerome said about the gunman. \"So with that in mind, that's why out of an abundance of caution, we've made plans and we've prepared here in case there's similar crime. But we really don't expect it here.\"\nThe absence of a high-profile attack in Chicago doesn't mean there hasn't been racism since the pandemic, or that it couldn't happen here, Grace Chan McKibben, the executive director of Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community, said.\n\"Folks are indeed worried,\" Chan McKibben said. \"People look at us with some level of suspicion, like as if we are a walking virus. The former president definitely didn't help with his rhetoric.\"\nShe added, \"But that does not mean that we have to live in fear. We have to live instead in strength and in power.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
