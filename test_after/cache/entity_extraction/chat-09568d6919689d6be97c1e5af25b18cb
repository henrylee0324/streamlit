Her family lived in Westchester County, New York before moving to Cresskill, where she sometimes felt boxed in. \nChan and Hur both understand the Asian immigrant experience and that language and culture have been barriers to attaining visibility. \n\"We're taught to work hard, keep our heads down, don't make trouble. These are cultural foundations,\" Hur said. \"We wrestle with it. I know our whole community wrestles with it.\" \nSo Chan is working on helping others in the community speak out. \"There's so much hesitation due to cultural norms,\" she said. \nA goal of the movement is to unify Asian Americans throughout New Jersey and celebrate diversity within diversity. \n\"We are made up of different cultures and races from around the world,\" Chan said. \"That's what makes us stronger.\" \nChris Chung \nGrowing up in a Korean immigrant household in Tenafly, assimilation was difficult for Chris Chung. He arrived in the United States at the age of 11 in 1978 and was among the few immigrant children in his school. While other classmates' parents attended school events and cheered for their children, Chung's parents were busy working at the family business, a general merchandise store in Brooklyn, and later a wholesale fine jewelry business. \n\"I envied other children's parents attending events, from sporting events to school events,\" said Chung, 53. \"That always stuck with me.\" As a result, he always thought that when he grew up and had children, he would make sure he was part of their education. \n― \n— \nAs an adult living in Palisades Park and wanting his children to enjoy a life he did not have Chung, a real estate agent, decided to get involved in local politics. Initially he ran for school board and then a borough council seat before being elected mayor in a contentious race against incumbent James Rotundo in 2018. An online tirade by Rotundo's mother against the town's large Korean community went viral. \nLorraine Rotundo posted on Facebook shortly after her son learned that the Democratic primary race in June of 2018 was too dose to call. \n\"Go to hell PALISADES PARK, let the GD KOREANS have this F'n town,\" she wrote. \"All of us AMERICANS are so done. I am going to suggest that only English be spoken in our Boro Hall at least while an AMERICAN is still the mayor.\" \nRotundo apologized for her post. More than 300 Korean Americans took to the streets to protest. \nNow in his third year as mayor, Chung reflects on his role as leader of a community that is almost 60% Asian. \n\"My whole purpose is to serve the community,\" Chung said. \"I'm not title-hungry.\" \nSince taking office, Chung has implemented changes such as hiring Korean speaking staff to serve residents and translating the borough's website into Korean and Spanish. \nHaving been a victim of racist bullying in New Jersey, Chung is glad to see anti-Asian racism being addressed publicly and nationally. \n\"I had many encounters being bullied — workplace conflicts,\" Chung said. I've seen many situations where Asians are viewed as non-aggressive. A lot of people have this perception that hey, we can pick on them. He probably won't retaliate back.\" \nWith the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes since the pandemic began, Chung takes time to speak to Asian constituents about the fear of being attacked. \n\"Sometimes they feel so isolated, even though they were born and raised here,\" Chung said. \nCulturally, Asians avoid conflict and avoid speaking out, Chung said. But it's time to change the old ways, he said. \n\"More Asians need to get involved in politics and community,\" he said. \"You are an American, just like everyone else. That's what I tell my children.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
