We need to talk about those things. \nBut we also need to pay attention to one response to the Atlanta spa killings: the way some conservatives rushed to insist that race and racism had nothing to do with the murders. \nIt is true that the man who confessed to the Atlanta killings said they were not racially motivated. He reportedly told police that he was struggling with a \"sex addiction\" and the killings were a way to \"eliminate temptation.\" \nThere's a lot in that statement to unpack, and a lot of smart people have been unpacking it over the past two weeks. \nMarcela Howell, who leads In Our Own Voice: National Black Women's Reproductive Agenda, was among the Black women who spoke in solidarity after the killings. \"While law enforcement officials have announced that the shooter's motivation was 'sex addiction,' we know that sexual violence and racism are often intertwined when it comes to violence against women,\" she said in a statement. \"As Black women, we know that our Asian-American sisters are disparately impacted at the intersections of racism, sexism, and xenophobia,\" Howell said. \nThere is a long history of bigotry and legal discrimination that directly targeted Asian immigrants and Asian Americans. Over the past year, that hostility was inflamed by bigoted rhetoric from former President Donald Trump describing COVID-19 as the \"Kung flu\" and warning that if he weren't reelected Americans would have to learn Chinese. \nAs Howell and many other activists and scholars have pointed out since the killings, racism in this country is deeply connected to sexism directed at women of color. And racism and misogyny are both intertwined with the history and culture of conservative white evangelicalism in which the Atlanta shooter was apparently steeped. \nKathryn Gin Lum, an associate professor of American religion at Stanford University, said the killings reflected \"a toxic brew\" of racism, sexism, and religion. That toxic brew has been used to justify anti-Asian laws and stoked anti-Asian violence going back to the 19th Century. \nReligion scholar Bradley Onishi and others point out that Jim Crow apartheid and anti-race-mixing laws were not only defended as necessary to protect the sexual purity of individual white women, but also the racial and religious purity of White Christian America. Black women and Asian women have often been both fetishized and demonized as hypersex-ual temptresses threatening the innocence of and purity of white Christian men. Young people raised in churches that emphasize \"purity culture\" are taught to have deep shame about their sexual feelings, and girls' and young women's bodies portrayed as threats to boys and young men. \nWe don't yet know, and may never fully understand, just how all these influences combined in the mind of this particular young man who chose to commit multiple murders. \nBut we can and should push back against law enforcement officials, conservative pundits and religious leaders who dismiss the reality of systemic racism or refuse to recognize the ways that women of color are particularly harmed by the mixture of racism and sexism that plagues our culture. \nBen Jealous serves as president of People For the American Way and People For the American Way Foundation. Jealous has decades of experience as a leader, coalition builder, campaigner for social justice and seasoned nonprofit executive. In 2008, he was chosen as the youngest-ever president and CEO of the NAACP. He is a graduate of Columbia University and Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar, and he has taught at Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in the United States where the spa killings occurred, prompting discussions about race and violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCELA HOWELL<|>PERSON<|>Marcela Howell is the leader of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women's Reproductive Agenda and spoke in solidarity after the Atlanta killings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IN OUR OWN VOICE: NATIONAL BLACK WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE AGENDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>In Our Own Voice is an organization focused on the reproductive rights and health of Black women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States whose rhetoric has been linked to increased hostility towards Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATHRYN GIN LUM<|>PERSON<|>Kathryn Gin Lum is an associate professor of American religion at Stanford University who commented on the intersection of racism, sexism, and religion in the context of the Atlanta killings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRADLEY ONISHI<|>PERSON<|>Bradley Onishi is a religion scholar who discusses the historical context of racism and sexism in America.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>People For the American Way is a progressive advocacy organization focused on social justice and civil rights.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEN JEALOUS<|>PERSON<|>Ben Jealous is the president of People For the American Way and has a history of leadership in social justice movements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAACP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The NAACP is a civil rights organization that fights for the rights of African Americans and has a long history of activism.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARCELA HOWELL<|>IN OUR OWN VOICE: NATIONAL BLACK WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE AGENDA<|>Marcela Howell leads the organization In Our Own Voice, which focuses on Black women's reproductive rights<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ATLANTA<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric has been linked to increased anti-Asian sentiment, which relates to the context of the Atlanta killings<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATHRYN GIN LUM<|>ATLANTA<|>Kathryn Gin Lum commented on the societal issues surrounding the Atlanta killings, linking them to racism and sexism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRADLEY ONISHI<|>ATLANTA<|>Bradley Onishi discussed the historical context of racism and sexism in relation to the Atlanta killings<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEN JEALOUS<|>PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY<|>Ben Jealous is the president of People For the American Way, advocating for social justice<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEN JEALOUS<|>NAACP<|>Ben Jealous was the youngest-ever president and CEO of the NAACP, linking him to civil rights activism<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
