It said: \n\"We are not yellow, we are human being \n\"We denounce hate and violence in all forms \n\"Anti-Asian just f**k off.\" \nShe knows it's only a sign, but she just couldn't keep it inside any longer. She had to strike back after a year in which anti-Asian sentiment has become an ugly side effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\"We should say something, but our culture, and Asian culture, we're not outspoken or vocal,\" Ms. Chaisri explained. \"But this time it's physical - hit that person, kick that person, kill that person. ... It's too much.\" \nToo much for someone who embodies the American dream. \nMs. Chaisri came to Pittsburgh from Bangkok in 1996 to study at Point Park University. She's since become an unofficial cultural ambassador for her culture through her cooking. She opened Thai Me Up in a small East Carson Street storefront in 2002. \n\"I think when I first opened there were maybe four Thai restaurants\" in Pittsburgh, she said. Now there are dozens. \nShe eventually moved to a larger space on South 23rd Street and opened Sweet Panda Asian Market, a Thai grocery in the space next door. \n\"A lot of my customers love the food but don't know what they're eating,\" let alone how to make it, she said. \nSo, in 2018 she and chef Piyo Boonyarat began offering cooking classes to share their personal stories and teach about the ingredients, processes and heavy intermingling of Indian and Chinese influences that give Thai food its unique complexity. After a long hiatus because of the pandemic, the classes have resumed; the next one is Sunday. \n\"I have a lot of customers that are really cool. They're open-minded and we explain about the food, and I love it,\" she said. \nThat's one reality. \nThen there's this one: She's also been harassed numerous times over the years by white and Black Americans and to this day, even in her own restaurant, routinely endures the microaggressions of people who assume she can't speak English or that all Asians are \"Chinese.\" The irony isn't lost on her, as most Americans can only speak English. \n\"But we never say anything. I think maybe because of our culture - we don't want to have confrontations or exchange words. Most of the time we take the high road. It doesn't mean we surrender to whatever you call us or label us.\" \nSince the 1800s, anti-Asian sentiment has crested in periodic waves - during and after World War II, the Vietnam War era and in the 1980s as America's industrial base shrank. \nThe attack in New York City came less than two weeks after a mass shooting in greater Atlanta in which eight people were killed, including four Asian women and two Asian men, mostly of Korean descent. There have been scores of high-profile incidents from California to Washington, D.C. The trend has followed the emergence of the COVID-19 virus first in China and was further exacerbated by the incendiary rhetoric of former President Donald Trump. \n\"It's been very personally cumulative for me over the past year,\" Jasmin Cho said. \"It's infuriating and so visceral. It's burned into my brain.\" \nMs. Cho creates food to help bridge cultural gaps and to help people heal. The Los Angeles native of Korean descent has lived in Pittsburgh for much of the past 19 years. In 2016, the Squirrel Hill resident created Yummyholic, an online bakery that she uses to elevate awareness on social justice issues. She calls it \"cookie activism.\" \n\"I use cookies as a medium because it is intentionally disarming and it keeps people's hearts tender,\" she said. \nShe's authored a children's book, and her work has been featured on \"CBS This Morning,\" NPR and the Food Network. In 2018, she hosted a TED talk in Pittsburgh about using baking to tell stories of Asian American history. Still based in Pittsburgh, Ms. Cho is now a master's candidate at New York's prestigious Pratt Institute, where she is developing a program that uses baking as therapy for those who have suffered trauma. \nSome of the first cookies she did during the pandemic depicted the exhausted faces of nurses in Wuhan. They are red, raw, swollen and creased from wearing masks and working nonstop. \n\"I was really moved, and I felt that necessity to put those faces out there with a message trying to remind folks that the same people you're demonizing are the faces of the people who are working so hard to fight against this,\" Ms. Cho said. \nShe's been looking at opening a retail bakery locally, but the events of the past year have given her pause. \n\"It's made me hypervigilant,\" she said, fearing that a business owned by an Asian woman might be a target. \n\"First I was afraid to go out because of the pandemic, but no mask can hide my Asian features, my black hair and the way that my eyes are shaped. These people who are getting attacked could be my parents. It's been nerve-wracking.\" \nShe relayed a\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NOI CHAISRI<|>PERSON<|>Noi Chaisri is a Filipino immigrant and owner of the restaurant Thai Me Up, who has been vocal against anti-Asian violence and sentiment in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is the location where a Filipino immigrant was attacked, highlighting issues of anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THAI ME UP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Thai Me Up is a restaurant owned by Noi Chaisri, which serves Thai cuisine and promotes cultural understanding.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWEET PANDA ASIAN MARKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sweet Panda Asian Market is a Thai grocery store opened by Noi Chaisri next to her restaurant Thai Me Up.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIYO BOONYARAT<|>PERSON<|>Piyo Boonyarat is a chef who collaborates with Noi Chaisri to offer cooking classes that share Thai culinary traditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JASMIN CHO<|>PERSON<|>Jasmin Cho is a Korean American food creator and activist based in Pittsburgh, known for her online bakery Yummyholic and her work on social justice issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YUMMYHOLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yummyholic is an online bakery created by Jasmin Cho that focuses on social justice through baking.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRATT INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pratt Institute is a prestigious school in New York where Jasmin Cho is a master's candidate, developing a program that uses baking as therapy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated anti-Asian sentiment and violence in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA MASS SHOOTING<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta mass shooting involved the killing of eight people, including four Asian women, and is part of the broader context of anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOI CHAISRI<|>THAI ME UP<|>Noi Chaisri is the owner of the restaurant Thai Me Up, which she uses to promote cultural understanding and denounce hate<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOI CHAISRI<|>SWEET PANDA ASIAN MARKET<|>Noi Chaisri opened Sweet Panda Asian Market next to her restaurant to provide Thai grocery options<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOI CHAISRI<|>PIYO BOONYARAT<|>Noi Chaisri collaborates with chef Piyo Boonyarat to offer cooking classes that educate about Thai cuisine<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JASMIN CHO<|>YUMMYHOLIC<|>Jasmin Cho created Yummyholic as an online bakery to promote social justice through her baking<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JASMIN CHO<|>PRATT INSTITUTE<|>Jasmin Cho is a master's candidate at Pratt Institute, where she is developing a therapeutic baking program<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>ANTI-ASIAN VIOLENCE<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased anti-Asian sentiment and violence in the U.S.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA MASS SHOOTING<|>ANTI-ASIAN VIOLENCE<|>The Atlanta mass shooting is a significant incident within the context of rising anti-Asian violence<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
