A 27-year-old Southeast Asian woman who spoke to the Globe recalled how a stranger pulled a fake gun on her while she was walking to work in Dorchester last May. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous so her family wouldn't worry, said a man was approaching her from the opposite direction when he aimed a bright green firearm at her. He pulled the trigger and the gun clicked. \n“I flinched,” she said, “and then he kept walking.” \nShe had always felt safe walking to work, but that moment changed everything. She felt conflicted about calling the police because she was worried about how their presence would affect Black residents in the neighborhood. But her co-workers urged her to report the incident. \nBetween sobs, she tried explaining the incident to police, but the operator on the other end “was confused why I was calling,” she said. “They didn't understand.” She was transferred to 911 and again, she was questioned why she was even calling when “this is not an emergency.” \n“They kept transferring me here and there,” the woman said. Then the call dropped. \nThe only official record of what happened to her is a complaint she filed online with the civil rights division of the state attorney general's office. But “there was no follow-up,” the woman said. She doesn't own a car, so she still walks to work. But now, she spends more money on rideshares and avoids public transportation because she fears being attacked on a train or bus. \nShe tries to hide her Asian features. \n“I wear sunglasses, I wear caps, I wear hoods,” she said. “I wear sneakers in case I need to run.”\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Brookings Institution is a nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, D.C., that conducts research and provides recommendations on various issues, including demographics and social policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK TIMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York Times is a prominent American newspaper known for its thorough news coverage and analysis of current events, including social issues affecting various communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DORCHESTER<|>GEO<|>Dorchester is a neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, known for its diverse population and community dynamics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHEAST ASIAN WOMAN<|>PERSON<|>A 27-year-old Southeast Asian woman who experienced a traumatic incident involving a fake gun while walking to work in Dorchester.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The state attorney general's office is a government agency responsible for legal affairs and civil rights enforcement within the state.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>911<|>EVENT<|>911 is the emergency telephone number in the United States used to report emergencies and request assistance from police, fire, and medical services.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTHEAST ASIAN WOMAN<|>DORCHESTER<|>The Southeast Asian woman experienced a traumatic incident while walking to work in Dorchester<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTHEAST ASIAN WOMAN<|>STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE<|>The Southeast Asian woman filed a complaint online with the civil rights division of the state attorney general's office regarding her incident<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTHEAST ASIAN WOMAN<|>911<|>The Southeast Asian woman attempted to report her incident to 911 but faced confusion and was transferred multiple times<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION<|>NEW YORK TIMES<|>The Brookings Institution's research and findings are often cited in articles by The New York Times, especially on social issues<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
