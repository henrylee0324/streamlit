In frail health, he knows he cannot defend himself. \n\"If people beat me, I can die right away,\" said Nguyen. \nHe tells his wife to come straight home from work and not run unnecessary errands. He also advises her to wear a mask and a hat. \"Don't let people recognize you as Vietnamese,‚Äù he said. \nWhen Nguyen learned about the beating of a 83-year-old Vietnamese immigrant in San Francisco that took place a day after the Atlanta shootings, he realized he knew the victim, Ngoc Pham, who was his supervisor on the police force in Vietnam. Nguyen still had Pham's number and reached out to check on him after an image of his badly bruised face was splayed over the Internet. \nPham told him he is going be OK, but Nguyen remains shaken. \"Oh my God, maybe me later, next time,\" he said. \nPresident Biden, through an executive order in January, has taken aim at anti-Asian hate and has directed the Department of Justice to make it one of its highest priorities. Last fall the US attorney's office in Massachusetts created a civil rights task force, and much of its current focus is on preventing hate crimes against the Asian American community, according to a spokeswoman. \nPolice departments in Boston and Lowell say that since the Atlanta killings, they have stepped up patrols, from Chinatown to Fields Corner, from Cambodia Town to the Buddhist temples in Lowell. They've also made sure bilingual officers are working those beats. \n\"We understand a lot of these crimes may go unreported,\" said Boston police Deputy Superintendent James Chin. \nChin said Boston police have been working closely with Asian American groups to encourage reporting of incidents of any kind. The department is also translating its brochure on civil rights into multiple languages, including Chinese and Vietnamese. \nOne of the biggest challenges is that undocumented immigrants fear deportation if they deal with the police. \n\"We don't care about their status,\" said Chin. \"Don't be afraid to report.\" \nChin grew up in Chinatown, and his parents are in their 80s. For him, this wave of anti-Asian sentiment \"hits home a little doser.\" \n\"We are not like New York or San Francisco,\" said Chin, but \"everyone is on edge. ... We want to be vigilant.\" \nThe Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino has been tracking decades of hate crime data. These acts tend to be vastly underreported, especially among Asian Americans, said the center's director, Brian Levin. \n\"This data does not reflect by any means the cumulative impact of actual hate crimes directed against Asian Americans,\" said Levin, a professor of criminal justice. \"What it is effective at is showing the trends, locations, targeting, and timing.\" \nLevin has found that Boston, New York, and Los Angeles are often a bellwether for hate crime for the rest of the country. What is troubling about the current climate of anti-Asian bias crimes beyond an overall increase is that the cases have been more violent. \nOne way to protect Asian Americans is strengthening hate crimes laws. Representative Grace Meng, a New York Democrat, has introduced legislation calling for greater federal oversight of COVID-19 related hate crimes and requiring the Justice Department to provide Congress with regular updates about bias incidents. In Massachusetts, Long Nguyen's daughter, state representative Tram Nguyen, is co-sponsoring a bill that would bolster the Commonwealth's hate crime statute. \nWhile some Asian American groups don't agree that legislative fixes are the best way to fight bias, Nguyen, along with Attorney General Maura Healey, sees updating the law as a way to increase accountability in the criminal justice system. \n\"It is important to name hate crimes for what they are. They are meant to terrorize communities,\" said Nguyen, a Democrat from Andover: \"This bill is not going to end hate and violence. It will allow justice to be served.\" \nShen, the woman who was shoved to the ground in Medford, still does not feel comfortable reporting the assault to the police. \nLieutenant Detective Paul Covino of the Medford police said he understands how some victims are wary of law enforcement, and so encourages Shen's friends and support network to report the incident on her behalf. \n\"We're here to help her, not to hurt her, or make her look bad,\" said Covino. \"If we have no one reporting to us there are Asian hate crimes going on, we assume there are none going on.\" \nAsian Americans are nearly 10 percent of Medford's 57,000 residents. Like Lowell and Quincy, Medford police have not received reports of anti-Asian hate crime over the past year. \nAre we to believe Massachusetts is largely insulated from anti-Asian hate? Or are our society and systems so broken we have lost our way? No community should live in fear, and it's time we fix this.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>METHUEN<|>GEO<|>Methuen is a city where Nguyen lives and feels unsafe due to rising anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city where an 83-year-old Vietnamese immigrant was beaten, highlighting the issue of anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGUYEN<|>PERSON<|>Nguyen is a resident of Methuen who is scared for his safety and concerned about anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGOC PHAM<|>PERSON<|>Ngoc Pham is a Vietnamese immigrant and former supervisor of Nguyen who was a victim of a violent attack.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRESIDENT BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>President Biden has taken measures against anti-Asian hate through executive orders and prioritizing hate crime prevention.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON<|>GEO<|>Boston is a city where police have increased patrols in response to anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOWELL<|>GEO<|>Lowell is a city where police have stepped up patrols to prevent anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIN<|>PERSON<|>James Chin is a Deputy Superintendent of Boston police who is actively working to address anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>This center tracks hate crime data and highlights the underreporting of hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRACE MENG<|>PERSON<|>Representative Grace Meng is a New York Democrat advocating for legislation to address COVID-19 related hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAURA HEALEY<|>PERSON<|>Attorney General Maura Healey supports updating hate crime laws in Massachusetts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAM NGUYEN<|>PERSON<|>Tram Nguyen is a state representative in Massachusetts and daughter of Long Nguyen, co-sponsoring a bill to strengthen hate crime laws.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDFORD<|>GEO<|>Medford is a city where an Asian woman was assaulted, and police are encouraging reporting of such incidents.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NGUYEN<|>NGOC PHAM<|>Nguyen reached out to Ngoc Pham after learning about his violent attack, indicating a personal connection and concern<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRESIDENT BIDEN<|>BOSTON<|>President Biden's executive order has influenced local police departments in Boston to prioritize anti-Asian hate crime prevention<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOSTON<|>LOWELL<|>Both Boston and Lowell police departments have increased patrols in response to anti-Asian hate crimes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHIN<|>BOSTON<|>James Chin, as Deputy Superintendent, is involved in the Boston police's efforts to combat anti-Asian hate<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>BOSTON<|>The center's data on hate crimes informs the Boston police's strategies against anti-Asian violence<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRACE MENG<|>MAURA HEALEY<|>Both are advocating for legislative changes to strengthen hate crime laws<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAM NGUYEN<|>LONG NGUYEN<|>Tram Nguyen is the daughter of Long Nguyen and is co-sponsoring a bill to strengthen hate crime laws<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEDFORD<|>CHIN<|>Chin is involved in addressing the concerns of victims in Medford regarding anti-Asian hate crimes<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
