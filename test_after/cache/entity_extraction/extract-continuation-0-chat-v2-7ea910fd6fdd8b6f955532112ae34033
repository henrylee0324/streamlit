This isn’t an isolated incident. There have been 500+ hate crimes targeted at Asian people this year alone,” social media specialist Mark Kim wrote on Twitter. “This Atlanta tragedy lies at an intersection of race, gender, class and the legacy of America’s history of colonization and violence in Asia,” journalist Elise Hu said on the site. “I don’t have the words. I’m just despondent. Protect Asian women, solidarity with sex workers, #StopAsianHate.”And as posts went viral, with comments affirming their calls for change, the news kept coming. “Atlanta shooting suspect told investigators that killings of Asian women weren’t racially motivated, police say,” said a Washington Post news alert. A quote from a Daily Beast story described the alleged shooter–who was charged on March 17 with eight counts of murder–as the son of a pastor who was “very innocent seeming.” Meanwhile the victims remained nameless. Later in the day, four were identified: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Yan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Additionally, Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, was injured in the attack. (Officials from the Atlanta police department are not naming the other victims until their families are notified.) By the time their names were made public, the suspect would already be accounted for by a member of the Cherokee County sheriff’s office who, in a video that was widely circulated, said: “Yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did.”In the dissonance was confirmation of what many Asian Americans already knew: the violence that has long targeted their community is rarely seen for what it is. Since the start of the pandemic last spring, Asian Americans have faced racist violence at a much higher rate than in previous years. Stop AAPI Hate, a reporting database created at the beginning of the pandemic as a response to the increase in racial violence, received 3,795 reports of anti-Asian discrimination between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021; women reported hate incidents at 2.3 times the rate of men.After his capture, the police noted that the shooter said he was seeking to address a “sexual addiction” and “was not racially motivated.” But for Asian women, racism and misogyny are deeply intertwined. A 2018 report from the American Psychological Association outlined the ways in which Asian-American women are exoticized and objectified in media and popular culture, depicted as “faceless, quiet and invisible, or as sexual objects.” The survey said these stereotypes “contribute to experiences of marginalization, invisibility and oppression” for Asian-American women. On March 16, America saw that reality manifest in the most brutal way.From the time the first wave of Chinese immigrants arrived as laborers in the U.S. in the 1850s, Asian Americans have always been subject to racist violence. As a source of cheap labor to build railroads, Asian immigrants came to be seen as threats to white jobs and scapegoated as dirty and disease-ridden. The “yellow peril” ultimately led to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first time the U.S. had ever barred a specific ethnic group from the country.The brutality runs through more than two centuries of U.S. history, from the incarceration camps of World War II, when over 100,000 Japanese Americans were rounded up and imprisoned because of xenophobic fears, to the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin, who died after being beaten by white men in a racially motivated attack in Detroit.Yet while racial violence has been an undeniable part of the history of Asian Americans in the U.S., the pervasive “model minority” myth has helped to obscure it. That false idea, constructed during the civil rights era to stymie racial-justice movements, suggests that Asian Americans are more successful than other ethnic minorities because of hard work, education and inherently law-abiding natures. Racial-justice educator Bianca Mabute-Louie emphasizes the connection between this damaging stereotype and the violence we’ve seen on the news–videos featuring Asian-American elders shoved to the ground. “This contributes to erasing the very real interpersonal violence that we see happening in these videos, and that Asian Americans experience from the day-to-day, things that don’t get reported and the things that don’t get filmed,” she says.Because the myth suggests upward mobility, it creates a fallacy that Asian Americans don’t experience struggle or racial discrimination. In reality, the community is America’s most economically divided: a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center found that Asian Americans experience the largest income-inequality gap as an ethnic and racial group in the U.S.The current surge in anti-Asian hate crimes was exacerbated by the xenophobic rhetoric of former President Donald Trump, who has continued to refer to COVID-19 as “the China virus,” blaming the country for the pandemic. Trump’s choice of words followed a long American history of using diseases to justify anti-Asian xenophobia–one that has helped to shape perception of Asian Americans as “perpetual foreigners.” “There’s a clear correlation between President Trump’s incendiary comments, his insistence on using the term Chinese virus, and the subsequent hate speech spread on social media and the hate violence directed toward us,” says Russell Jeung, a co-founder of Stop AAPI\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in the U.S. where a mass shooting targeting Asian-American women occurred on March 16.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARK KIM<|>PERSON<|>Mark Kim is a social media specialist who commented on the Atlanta shooting and the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes on Twitter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELISE HU<|>PERSON<|>Elise Hu is a journalist who discussed the implications of the Atlanta shooting in relation to race, gender, and class.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a reporting database created to address the increase in anti-Asian discrimination and violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the U.S. whose rhetoric has been linked to the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>PERSON<|>Vincent Chin was a victim of a racially motivated attack in 1982, symbolizing the history of anti-Asian violence in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT<|>EVENT<|>The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first law in the U.S. to bar a specific ethnic group from entering the country.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RACIAL VIOLENCE<|>EVENT<|>Racial violence against Asian Americans has been a persistent issue throughout U.S. history, exacerbated by various socio-political factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEW RESEARCH CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Pew Research Center is a think tank that conducted a study revealing income inequality among Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN-AMERICAN WOMEN<|>PERSON<|>Asian-American women have been disproportionately affected by anti-Asian hate crimes and face unique challenges related to racism and misogyny.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARK KIM<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Mark Kim's comments on social media highlight the work of Stop AAPI Hate in addressing anti-Asian hate crimes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELISE HU<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Elise Hu's commentary on the Atlanta shooting reflects the broader issues of anti-Asian violence that Stop AAPI Hate seeks to address<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric has been linked to the increase in hate crimes reported by Stop AAPI Hate<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCENT CHIN<|>RACIAL VIOLENCE<|>Vincent Chin's murder is a historical example of racial violence against Asian Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT<|>RACIAL VIOLENCE<|>The Chinese Exclusion Act is part of the historical context of racial violence against Asian Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEW RESEARCH CENTER<|>ASIAN-AMERICAN WOMEN<|>The Pew Research Center's study on income inequality highlights the economic struggles faced by Asian-American women<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN-AMERICAN WOMEN<|>RACIAL VIOLENCE<|>Asian-American women are particularly vulnerable to both racism and misogyny, as highlighted in the context of the Atlanta shooting<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
