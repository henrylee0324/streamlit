What if I had said this instead?\n\"I would feel worse not doing something than doing something, but that's in environments that were still safe,\" Kulkarni said. \"If you asked me, 'Would I do it alone around a big man?' No, I would not.\"\nWhen Jackie Louie was a student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, a few men in a truck drove by and shouted racial slurs at her and her friends, who were also Asian American.\n\"We didn't say anything back,\" she recalled. \"We were silent. We were shocked.\"\nAfter some students made fun of her parents for speaking Chinese, her father said he had ignored them because it was better not to cause trouble.\nNow she has rehearsed comebacks in her head after hearing about recent racist attacks against Asian Americans.\n\"I feel like the right thing to do is speak up and defend either myself or whoever is being victimized,\" the 30-year-old Torrance resident said.\n\"However, I really don't know how it would be until I'm in the moment.\"\nJoy Kim, who grew up in Orange County, was recently in a New York park when a man asked her age. She has often been told by strangers that she looks young, usually followed by, \"It must be your Asian genes.\"\nThe man seemed friendly at first, so she responded that she was in her 20s. The man told her she looked like she was 2.\n\"You can never tell with you Chinese people,\" he said.\n\"I'm actually not Chinese,\" said Kim, who is Korean, reflexively correcting him.\n\"You're lying. You're Chinese. You have COVID,\" he told her. \"Don't ever take your mask off because you'll give us all COVID.\"\nAs Kim walked away, the man screamed after her, calling her a \"b--\" and threatening to cut off all her hair.\n\"I almost want to just hide and not say anything or just like not be part of the situation anymore,\" said Kim, who ignores and avoids eye contact with strangers on the street who have greeted her with \"Ni hao\" -- \"How are you?\" in Mandarin. \"I guess I sort of was taught that reacting with anger or anything will make the situation worse.\"\nWhat weighed on the 25-year-old the rest of the day was not just the interaction with the stranger but the remarks from friends and acquaintances over the years that she had previously convinced herself were harmless.\n\"If someone said something racist against Asians in the past, I think I would just laugh it off, I guess, move on, and just like hold your anger for later,\" she said. \"Now I feel like things have changed.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
