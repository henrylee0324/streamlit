The incident, which is the latest in a spate of hate crimes, has also caused unease among some US-based Singaporeans.\nSingaporean Pearly Tan, who lives in the US with her young family, has seen racism up close. She describes her encounters over the years and the steps she has taken to protect herself and her family.COMMENTARY, March 24 - On Sunday (March 21) evening, I put on a beanie, headphones and raincoat to go for a walk.\nIt was supposed to help me relax after a day of working from home. Instead, I was constantly afraid that I would be attacked from the side or behind, or approached from blind spots.\nDowntown Berkeley, with its many university students, used to bustle with life before the Covid-19 pandemic.\nYet it was isolated and quiet.\nI adjusted my walking route to avoid the few people who were out and seemed unstable. They were shouting mostly to themselves.\nBut I met one of them again on my way home and she was holding a stick.\nI had forgotten to take along my pepper spray and stun gun.\nIt is at times like this when I do not know if making eye contact with a potential threat would trigger an attack.\nI am part of a mixed-race family in the US.\nMy husband is Blackand we have two \"Blasian\" children (those with African and Asian heritage), aged five and two.\nWhen I first saw news of the recent shootings at spas in Georgia, which killed six women of Asian descent, I chose not to read further.\nI was in the middle of my work day and did not want to feel the emotions I knew would surface.\nI have felt them each time a Black person or child has been wrongfully murdered in the US, and wondered how else I could protect my husband and children.\nWith the continuous spate of violence against minorities in the US, our family needs to be deliberate about when we open ourselves to the fear and anger that come with reading about others like us losing their lives.\nFor the first time, with the recent shootings, I saw a murder victim with the same last name as mine.\nI am concerned that this recent shooting, which the gunman claimed was sexually motivated, would only be the start of more violence against Asians.\nThe larger problem that has been brought to the fore, however, is the sexualisation of Asian women by white men.\nWhen I first moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2012, I was frequently the subject of catcalls.\nIn San Francisco, a guy said \"slanted eyes and juicy thighs\" as I walked by.\nToday, that permission to harass Asians in public spaces has pivoted only slightly to include a veiled anger that has built up over the years, due toAmerican leaders' regurgitation of the \"model minority\" myth that encourages other minorities to see us as the \"other\".\nFormer president Donald Trump's repeated rhetoric that Covid-19 came from the Chinese did not help.\nEveryday racism\nI am very much aliveto the racism that pervades the US.\nLast year, I was at a farmers' market in Berkeley, where I picked up a sealed box of cherries and put them down.\nA white man began yelling at me, loud enough for everyone in the area to hear how I was \"disgusting\" (with an expletive thrown in) and the reason for the pandemic.\nI walked away, but he and his partner followed me to another store. I eventually left.\nAt least 20 people witnessed the incident, but no one said or did anything.\nAfter that, I did not go to the farmers' market for months.\nI did not even want to go grocery shopping, so my husband had to do it.\nOur family has experienced other threats of racial violence.\nIt is hard to describe the myriad of feelings that coursed through me the day my children and I were spotted by a racist white man who threatened our family.\nAs he shouted vulgarities from across the street, I made sure my children walked close beside me and away from his vitriol. It was the best I could do.\nThis was pre-pandemicand the area was crowded but, again, no one intervened.\nWhen he was distracted for a moment, I grabbed my kids and weaved us into a crowd and then whisked them down a side street.\nSince last year, I have also been acutely aware of how seniors in the Asian community here have been violently attacked as they went about their daily activities.\nWaiting to cross a street should not be a scary affair.\nI am extremely thankful that my parents are in Singapore and not living through this in the US.\nTo be sure, I have had positive encounters, too.\nFor example, in my workplace, several people have reached out to offer support. Safe spaces have been created for me to share my authentic feelings and concerns.\nFrom town halls and virtual meetings to chat groups for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, some of my colleagues and friends truly care and I will not waste time running after those who do not.\nSelf-defence\nWith the increased violence against Asians, the least I can do is continue as we have.\nBecause of the pandemic, we have mostly kept a safe distancefrom friends and family, which also means that we do not spend much time in public where others gather.\nBut when I must go out, I am more likely to carry a self-defence tool and much more likely to intervene if I see someone being attacked.\nShort of owning a gun over concerns about misfires, especially with our young children, we have taken many precautions to reduce our risks - from taking self-defence classes to having a steel bat by the entrances to our home.\nI have come to accept that this is life in America.- TODAY\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KUALA LAMPUR<|>GEO<|>Kuala Lampur is the capital city of Malaysia, where the incident highlighting violence against Asians occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEARLY TAN<|>PERSON<|>Pearly Tan is a Singaporean woman living in the US who has experienced racism and is concerned about the safety of her family.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOWNTOWN BERKELEY<|>GEO<|>Downtown Berkeley is an area known for its university students, which has become quiet and isolated during the Covid-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is the state where recent shootings at spas occurred, resulting in the deaths of six women of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA<|>GEO<|>The San Francisco Bay Area is where Pearly Tan moved in 2012 and has experienced racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The Covid-19 pandemic has affected social interactions and increased feelings of fear and isolation among communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former president whose rhetoric about Covid-19 has contributed to anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN COMMUNITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian community in the US has faced increased violence and racism, particularly during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEARLY TAN<|>DOWNTOWN BERKELEY<|>Pearly Tan describes her experiences of fear and isolation while walking in Downtown Berkeley<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEARLY TAN<|>GEORGIA<|>Pearly Tan reflects on the shootings in Georgia that killed women of Asian descent, which has impacted her feelings of safety<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEARLY TAN<|>SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA<|>Pearly Tan moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and has experienced racism there<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>ASIAN COMMUNITY<|>The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated violence against the Asian community<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ASIAN COMMUNITY<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric has contributed to the rise of anti-Asian sentiment and violence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEARLY TAN<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Pearly Tan discusses how the pandemic has affected her family's social interactions and safety<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
