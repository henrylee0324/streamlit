this country because she, like generations of immigrants before her, believed in the American ideal.\n\"What made America great is the open and welcoming culture of diversity,\" said Wang, an accounting director with a healthcare company and a mother of two. \"That's why it attracts so many talented and diverse people.\"\nBut recently, she and other Asian Americans like her have wondered, \"Is this really the country we signed up for?\"\nRecent attacks on Asian Americans, many brought on by hatred and misplaced blame for the COVID-19 pandemic, have created a sense of fear among a diverse community made up of several cultures, nationalities, languages and histories who are all nonetheless often seen as a monolith.\nAnd the brutal murders of eight people — six of them Asian women — in Atlanta have fueled more fear among Asian Americans in South Jersey, but also a sense of resolve that the time to act to end hate is long overdue.\nDuring a Zoom meeting arranged by the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey, several people talked about their experiences with discrimination and racism and their fears for their families and themselves.\nThey and others also expressed hope that, in the same way that the killing of George Floyd sparked a reckoning over treatment of Black Americans, the Atlanta shootings might also bring recognition, support and action to stop the targeting of Asian Americans.\nNothing new, but worse than ever\nEdward Wang is a professor of Asian history at Rowan University who has lived in the United States for more than 30 years. A former member of the Cherry Hill Board of Education and a native of Shanghai, China, he said anti-Asian sentiment is nothing new.\n\"Looking back in this country's history, Asian Americans have been discriminated against since at least 1882, with the Chinese Exclusion Act,\" he noted. Before 1965's Immigration and Nationality Act, quotas kept most Asians from becoming American citizens.\nBut even for those who are citizens, including Asians born in the United States, there is discrimination.\n\"We are constantly being asked, 'where did you come from?'\" said Wang. \"People assume that if you are Asian you must be a recent immigrant. It's not very comfortable for us.\"\nU.S. Rep. Andy Kim represents New Jersey's Third District and is the son of Korean immigrants.\n\"The short answer is yes, I have experienced racist discrimination, and so have members of my family along with many others in South Jersey,\" Kim told the Courier-Post.\nPeople avoided him, told him they worried he could give them the coronavirus; he had heard from Asian restaurateurs whose businesses were targeted with racist graffiti.\nRhetoric used by former President Donald Trump, especially his use of terms like \"China virus\" and \"kung flu,\" made things worse, creating a sense of blame as COVID-19 forced lockdowns, and the lockdowns caused the economy to crater.\n\"We know that discrimination existed before coronavirus and sadly it will continue after this is over,\" said Kim, a Democrat. \"But this has been gasoline poured over a fire.\"\nKim worries that as tensions escalate with China over issues like trade and human rights, xenophobia, hate and discrimination could escalate as well.\nAnd many Asian Americans worry not only for themselves, but for their families.\n\"All Asian American kids have experienced this kind of discrimination, but the pandemic has raised it to a level that cannot go unnoticed, and must be stopped,\" said Xiufang Chen, a Cherry Hill resident and mother.\n\"This is the first time I don't feel safe,\" said Li Li, the principal of Cherry Hill Huaxia Chinese who is originally from Xi'an, China. Some parents she's spoken with, she said, \"don't want to make a big fuss, or want to let it go, but really we shouldn't. ... We should let our kids know what (behavior) is right and what is wrong.\"\nThe 'model minority' problem\nOften seen as \"model minority,\" a monolith of hardworking, industrious and entrepreneurial people, Asian Americans are really a diverse race from countries with very distinct cultures, languages, histories and cuisines.\nFor example, there are 56 ethnic groups in China and linguists estimate 297 living languages are spoken among the 1.21 billion people in Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet. The Philippines is a nation with more than 7,000 islands and more than 170 ethnic groups, influenced by centuries of migration and conquest from Malaysia, South Asia, Spain, China and the United States.\n\"The model minority is a damaging perception, but it's one that lends itself to people thinking they can ignore (Asian Americans), that they are off doing their own thing, that if they don't complain then everything must be going well,\" said Kim.\nMany Asian Americans don't speak up, he acknowledged, \"because they don't think anything will happen or that anyone will care,\" leading to greater feelings of isolation.\n\"Many in the Asian community struggle,\" said Chen. \"Sometimes when I think of this tragedy (the Atlanta shootings) I get angry, because did it take this happening for people to realize Asian Americans deserve attention?\"\n\"It dodges the real problem we have,\" said Nina Gao, president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and Shanghai native who lives in Cherry Hill.\n\"It is a way to wedge us out of the mainstream: You can take care of yourselves, you all live in these Chinatowns. We give you this glorious title, but it keeps us away, it makes us feel very foreign.\"\n\"We're thought of as self-supporting and people who make a lot of money, and that makes us targets,\" said Wen Gu, a librarian from Cherry Hill.\n\"Many Americans don't want to take the time to really learn about us, so they lump us all together,\" said Gao, who is on the faculty of Rutgers University's\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLISON WANG<|>PERSON<|>Allison Wang is a Cherry Hill resident, an accounting director with a healthcare company, and a mother of two who believes in the American ideal of diversity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDWARD WANG<|>PERSON<|>Edward Wang is a professor of Asian history at Rowan University, a former member of the Cherry Hill Board of Education, and a native of Shanghai, China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. REP.
