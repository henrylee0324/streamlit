We are hopeful that a lot of people are just checking in with each other,\" she said.\nThe shootings follow a wave of violence against Asian Americans in the country that jumped with the start of the pandemic, stirred by the racist and xenophobic language used by former President Donald Trump to tie the coronavirus to its origin in Wuhan, China.\nMany Asian Americans in Wisconsin are still mourning the losses in Atlanta — and speaking out to make sure their voices and concerns about their safety are being heard.\nDiscrimination seen during pandemic in Wisconsin\nStop AAPI Hate, an advocacy group, reported nearly 3,800 incidents of harassment, discrimination and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from March 2020 to February 2021 nationwide, compared with around 100 incidents in previous years. Women reported hate incidents more than twice as often as men.\nAdvocates and residents around the country already had been speaking up about the rise in violence after reports of a series of attacks this year against Asian seniors and the killing of 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee in San Francisco.\nFor Pam Her of Appleton, owner of 4Chi Business Solutions, the deaths drove home a fear she had been protecting her family and AAPI neighbors against since the early days of the pandemic.\nHer, like many other Hmong residents in the region, had to find ways to protect herself as the number of reports of discrimination and violence grew during the pandemic. Her's family began traveling only during the day and keeping an eye on family members whenever they stepped outside.\n\"We did all our shopping, all the things that we need to do during the day and not go shopping at night – shopping in pairs, taking care of our families, our grandparents, our elderly parents, our elderly uncles and aunts, making sure they don't go to a store by themselves,\" Her said.\n\"If our grandparents or our mothers or fathers are going outside, even beyond our home, just to the garden next to our home, we watch them. We make sure that we are able to see them, that there's a window to protect them.\"\nTara Yang has noticed differences in Green Bay, too. She saw a drop in customers at her family's store, Main Oriental Market, when the first cases arrived in the county in March.\nThrough summer months, business slowed down at their store, and some customers tried to avoid the store.\n\"We kind of understood and felt that people didn't want to come to the shop as much anymore just because of the fact that we're an Asian store,\" Yang said.\nIn April, the market's service vans were vandalized with a racist message related to COVID-19, Yang said.\nBut she noticed racism in other subtle ways, too, like when someone would go out of their way to avoid being around her when she was shopping at another grocery store or when she went to the bank to help her parents apply for a business loan.\nThe \"model minority myth,\" a stereotype that says all Asian Americans are successful and problem-free, has often hidden racism toward Asian Americans, Her said.\n\"As the model minority, we have been very invisible and ... even in spaces where we are the leader of those spaces, our voices a lot of times blend in with everything else. We really don't stand out,\" Her said. \"I think that with everything that is happening, the invisibility of the Asian community is coming to the surface now.\"\nWhen Her heard about the shootings in Atlanta, one of her biggest fears came true.\n\"We did not think about our Asian businesses and safety protocols for them because they are a sitting target,\" she said.\nMany advocates, including Yang, said it shouldn't have needed to come to this crisis point in Atlanta because people around the country were sounding the alarm much earlier.\n\"It's sad that we had to wait until people died to take action. Since the start of the pandemic, we've been voicing, 'Hey someone just verbally attacked us. Someone tried to spit on us.' But people overlooked that. That's exactly why we're at where we're at right now, because those little crimes were overlooked,\" Yang said.\nIt raises a question Her has had to ask over and over: \"Why can't we be seen as Americans and be valued as Asian Americans? Why must we always be stereotyped as a foreigner?\"\nSheng L. Riechers, a senior communications specialist for the city of Appleton, noted that there is a broad range of people who identify as Asian Americans, from countries in extremely diverse regions of east Asia, southeast Asia, and south Asia.\n\"As a Hmong American\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
