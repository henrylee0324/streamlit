As a result for every Black who joined the American revolutionists, another 5 fought for the British Army. Likewise, the British helped over 50,000 Blacks flee the United States to various parts of the British Empire, wherein they deprived the richest rebel patriots of their chattel property. Few people are aware that the War of 1812 was fought in part by the richest Americans trying to compel the British to return stolen slaves. The greatest defeat of the United States Army at the gates of Washington in 1813 was inflicted on the ex- slaves given their freedom in exchange for military service. \nAfrican-Indian people fought the United States from the early 1800s to the 1850s. These so-called Seminole Wars (also called Negro and Ibo Wars by the United States Congress) bankrupted the early American Republic and cost more lives than any war until the Civil War. Slave revolts kept the Southern States on edge, and the entire American economic system was wholly dependent on the labor of enslaved Black people-by the 1860s 60% of the U.S. economy based on cotton alone. The United States Government Constitution was delayed in ratification in part of the issue of ending the importation of Black people. \nBlack oppression was central to American life for example the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 (which limited the expansion of slavery), the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, Banning of African Importation in 1808, The formation of the American Colonization Society (the U.S. government agency created in 1816 to repatriate Blacks to Africa), the Missouri Compromise 1820 (which limited the expansion of slavery), The Nat Turner Revolt of 1831, The Lone Star Revolution 1835-1836 (Americans fought to preserve Black slavery, the Texas Annexation (1845), Jacksonian Racial Riots (two decades of urban anti-Black riots in Northern states from 1820-1845), the Mexican American War (1846-1848) was influenced by the desire to expand slavery, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, Bleeding Kansas 1854-1856 (mass violence over slavery in Kansas-Nebraska Territory) and John Brown's Raid on the Federal Arsenal at Harper's Ferry in 1859 all were important national events early United States history-all either wholly or significantly influenced by the institution of slavery. \nFinally, the most bloody and destructive war and most brutal domestic conflicts in American history the Civil War (1860-1865) and the Reconstruction era (1865-1877) were caused by efforts to preserve slavery and to reinstitute Black slavery under another guise. Over the entire course 20th century, American life has been punctuated by communal racial violence, racial pogroms, lynching, racial terror, race riots, ethnic cleansing, police murder, peonage, segregation, convict lease slavery, unjust executions under the color of law, non-consensual human experimentation, eugenics, and countless other atrocities primarily and typically inflicted upon Blacks in most of the United States, and no other ethnic group has suffered as much or as often. \nRacial hatred and ethnic divisions have always been a means to maintain power by the elite, and healing these would unite the people and could bring about a major social change. Lest we forget Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, Dr. Martin L. King, Jr., and Senator Robert Kennedy were assassinated in 1963, 1965, and 1968 for trying to unite all the American people. The Black Panthers were exterminated for trying to unite the people. There exist agencies and forces in the intelligence community that keeps the people down. Starting in 1917, the United States government began targeting outspoken activists who were deemed dangerous. The Palmer Raids/Red Scare Summer (1919), CointelPro 1956-1973 And the activities of \"Black Desks\", \"Red Squads\", and elements of the American intelligence agencies have worked to divide and destroy dissent. \nDonald Trump's presidency did not divide the nation. Rather Trump's tenure in office allowed the world and Americans to see the fissures in society that have been in existence since the European settlers first arrived on these shores. In reality, Trump's refusal to hide or obscure real social issues helped empower activists who are \noften ignored and dismissed for a want of undeniable evidence of systemic and structural racism and injustice. \nTrump as a President did not harm Black Americans, and his policies did not target law-abiding and legal residents or citizens of the United States. On the other hand, the racism and divisions in America are useful to the ruling classes who play on these problems to increase their power. Unity is not of interest to an elite who extracts its wealth and power from division and hatred. Biden and Harris are both persons who deeply hate poor people in general and Blacks in particular, and their roads to power were based on identity politics that thrive on conflict and racial fault lines. The Biden administration given his 50-year record of persecuting Blacks (best seen with refusal to continue the criminal justice reform policies of Trump and maniacal belief that Blacks are at war against Asians and his worship of mass incarceration policies), his total slave-like obedience to the COVID-19 mandated fascism over American life, his nonsensical immigration policies and tolerance for human trafficking, and his deviant sexual obsession with offending the religious and moral sentiments of scores of millions of Americans promoting transgenderism and genital mutilation of minors preclude his being able to unite America in anything but bloodshed and chaos. \nQ: Given the U.S. performance under the Trump presidency, do you think the country can present a successful model of governance to the world? \nI have no faith in the present administration of President Joseph R\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN PATRIOTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The American Patriots were revolutionists during the American Revolution, opposing British rule and fighting for independence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRITISH ARMY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The British Army was the military force of Great Britain, which fought against the American revolutionists during the American Revolution.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAR OF 1812<|>EVENT<|>The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and Great Britain, partly over issues related to slavery and the return of escaped slaves.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIVIL WAR<|>EVENT<|>The Civil War was a major conflict in the United States from 1860 to 1865, primarily over the issues of slavery and states' rights.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDGAR EVERS<|>PERSON<|>Medgar Evers was a civil rights activist who was assassinated in 1963 for his efforts to unite Americans and fight racial injustice.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALCOLM X<|>PERSON<|>Malcolm X was a prominent civil rights leader who advocated for the rights of Black Americans and was assassinated in 1965.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
