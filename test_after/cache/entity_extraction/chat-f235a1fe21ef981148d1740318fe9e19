Authorities identified the victims on Friday as Soon C. Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong A. Yue, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan and Daoyou Feng.\nAtlanta police say it's too soon to label the killings as a hate crime, despite a national outcry to do so from experts, activists and Asian Americans across the country.\nWhile Long claimed the killings were motivated by a self-proclaimed sex addiction, many Asians and Pacific Islanders nationwide, including here in Iowa, have pointed to the carnage as yet another example of a rise in violent attacks against Asian Americans. They view the attacks as fueled by racism and xenophobia during the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-China rhetoric conveyed by former President Donald Trump and other prominent conservatives.\nIn Iowa, recent reports of anti-Asian racism have mainly taken the form of increased microaggressions against people perceived to be from China, where the initial outbreak of COVID-19 was first disclosed in January 2020. But Tuesday's killings were not the first time Yusef, who is Filipina, has had to join in collectively grieving a violent attack against her community.\nYusef said Thursday that, while the increase of violence against Asians and Pacific Islanders is \"terrifying,\" it's worth noting that racism against those groups is nothing new. Rather, the increase in anti-Asian attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted deeply rooted historical and transnational racism against Asians and Pacific Islanders and violence against Asian women, she said.\nYusef cited many examples, including the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882; American colonialism in Asian countries; domestic and sexual violence due to harmful, hypersexual stereotypes of \"docile, submissive\" Asian women; and, during the pandemic, the stabbing of three members of an Asian American family – including two small children – in Texas because the suspect thought they were \"Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus,\" according to an FBI intelligence report.\n\"There is a lack of analysis – we cannot forget that anti-Asian sentiment is also deeply connected with anti-Blackness, xenophobia, white supremacy,\" said Yusef, co-founder of the Des Moines-based organization Monsoon Asians and Pacific Islanders in Solidarity.\n\"If (authorities) will just say, 'he is a sex addict or he had a bad day,' then we ignore the right questions: Why would he choose a massage parlor with low-wage Asian women employees? As Asian women, we are seen as invisible, submissive. It's like we're nothing.\"\nAdvocates: Microaggressions, racist attacks against Asian Iowans under-reported\nJust one month into the pandemic, Iowa's Asians and Pacific Islanders were already sharing stories among each other, and publicly, of increased racism against their communities and a growing fear of anti-Asian violence both locally and nationally.\nAsian Iowans previously shared with the Register information about microaggressions they had experienced. Some examples appeared explicit and included individuals being yelled at with \"coronavirus,\" a white couple leaving a grocery line to avoid standing next to an Asian American mother buying a birthday cake for her son, and a white woman leaving a Chinese restaurant after asking the owners if they were Chinese.\nOther examples were more subtle, such as tense looks or stares.\nIn 2019, there were 29,370 Asians and Pacific Islanders in the Des Moines metro area, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, or 4.2% of the population. That was up from 3.7% in 2015.\nIn 2017, 2.6% of Iowa's total population was Asian, according to the State Data Center, with Des Moines, Ames and Iowa City having the largest numbers. That percentage is projected to grow to 4.4% by 2050, the center reported.\nNu Huynh, executive director of the Iowa Asian Alliance, has been keeping tabs on potential racism and xenophobia tied to COVID-19 with an online form people can fill out for complaints. Since the start of the pandemic, she has been encouraging the community to report any type of racism or xenophobia, from microaggressions to violent attacks.\nSo far, she's received only a handful of complaints, Huynh said, the most violent being an egg thrown at an Asian Iowan.\n\"We just have been very fortunate here in Iowa that we have not seen the level of violence that we are seeing around the world,\" Huynh told the Register, acknowledging that it's possible there could be attacks and microaggressions that haven't been reported.\nDes Moines police data shows that aggravated assaults against Asian victims decreased from 33 incidents in 2019 to 24 in 2020. The Des Moines Police Department was still compiling data of other crimes against Asians, including harassment, as of Thursday night.\nLast year, the Iowa Civil Rights Commission took nine discrimination complaints from Iowans who identify as Asian. None has been filed in 2021.\n\"There's probably a lot of people that are experiencing (racism and xenophobia), but they're not saying anything,\" Huynh said. Obstacles to filing reports include fear of retaliation and victims not believing that will make a difference, she said.\nNationally, more than 3,800 incidents of racism and xenophobia against Asians and Pacific Islanders were recorded between March 2020 and February by Stop AAPI Hate, a San Francisco-based reporting center.\nThe majority of discrimination reported involved verbal harassment\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
