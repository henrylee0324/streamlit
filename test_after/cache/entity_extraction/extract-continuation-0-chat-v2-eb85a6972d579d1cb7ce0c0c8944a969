An elderly Asian woman kicked in her stomach and stomped in the face in broad daylight in New York. A Thai immigrant in his 80s, fatally shoved to the ground in San Francisco. And an 89-year-old Chinese woman slapped in the face and set on fire in Brooklyn, N.Y. \nA string of recent hate crimes against Asian-Americans has the nation grappling with how to address and confront the issue. And following a year of racist rhetoric toward people of Asian descent amid the coronavirus pandemic, stories of blatant discrimination against the minority group have increasingly come to forefront. \nBut Asian-Americans haven't just been targeted during the pandemic, An Chung Cheng, a Spanish professor at the University of Toledo, told The Blade on Friday. Systemic discrimination against Asian-Americans has persisted for years, she said. \nWhat happened in the past year is not only just because of the pandemic, or hate rhetoric, Ms. Cheng said. All of this can be rooted back in history. \nMs. Cheng and four other panelists will give a presentation on Asian-American discrimination and have an open dialogue at a virtual town-hall discussion Tuesday. The program, Stop Anti-Asian Hate, The Fight to Eliminate Racism in All Forms, will tackle systemic and institutionalized discrimination against Asian-Americans, and look at some of the problem's roots, Ms. Cheng said. \nAccording to Stop Hate AAPI, an activist organization that labels itself as a reporting center created to track and respond to hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States, 3,795 reports of hate incidents were documented in the country during the 12 months that ended with February. It's a number that doesn't take into account for other hateful incidents that aren't even classified as hate crimes. \nIt's very difficult to prosecute hate crimes, Ms. Cheng said. But it doesn't mean that hate crimes don't exist or prejudice \nagainst Asian-Americans doesn't exist. \nWe would like to increase the dialogue, she added. Because of the violence against Asian-Americans, particularly to the most vulnerable groups like elders, the Asian-American community is starting to feel like we need to stand up. \nIn March, 2020, the FBI warned of a potential surge in hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the pandemic. That didn't stop many elected officials from using hateful rhetoric many activist groups say encourages bigotry and hate towards Asians. \nFormer President Trump began the verbal attacks in 2020, referring to the coronavirus as the China Virus, Chinese virus, and Kung Flu. Several Republicans followed suit. Just last week, Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted referred to the coronavirus as the Wuhan Virus, in a tweet and later doubled down on the message, explaining he only meant to criticize the Chinese government. \nBut that rhetoric sends the wrong message to Americans, Ms. Cheng said, and in some cases has severe consequences. \nThe general public does not know who is Chinese, or Korean, or Japanese, she said. And so all of us who look like Asians will be targeted, and be scapegoats, and be blamed for the pandemic. \nFederal hate-crime data has not yet been released for 2020. Hate crimes in 2019 were the highest in more than a decade. \nSara Clark, director of UT's center for international studies and programs, will moderate the discussion, which takes place virtually at noon on Tuesday and can be streamed via Webex. \nIn addition to Ms. Cheng, the panel will feature: Joseph Hara, director of UT's Japanese program; Hua Liu Sowa, an education student at UT; Carolyn Sowa, a Toledo native who is studying international law at Beijing University, and Xinren Yu, assistant director for UT's center for international studies and programs. \nThe town hall is the 13th in a UT series of discussions called Dialogues on Diversity, that began after George Floyd, a Black man, was controversially killed by a police officer in Minneapolis last year.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city where a shooting rampage occurred, resulting in the deaths of eight people, including six Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a city where an elderly Asian woman was violently attacked in broad daylight.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city where a Thai immigrant in his 80s was fatally shoved to the ground.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROOKLYN<|>GEO<|>Brooklyn is a neighborhood in New York where an 89-year-old Chinese woman was attacked and set on fire.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AN CHUNG CHENG<|>PERSON<|>An Chung Cheng is a Spanish professor at the University of Toledo who speaks on systemic discrimination against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Toledo is an educational institution where An Chung Cheng works and where discussions on Asian-American discrimination are held.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP ANTI-ASIAN HATE<|>EVENT<|>Stop Anti-Asian Hate is a program aimed at tackling systemic discrimination against Asian-Americans through discussions and presentations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP HATE AAPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop Hate AAPI is an activist organization that tracks and responds to hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOSEPH HARA<|>PERSON<|>Joseph Hara is the director of the Japanese program at the University of Toledo and a panelist in the discussion on Asian-American discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUA LIU SOWA<|>PERSON<|>Hua Liu Sowa is an education student at the University of Toledo and a panelist in the discussion on Asian-American discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAROLYN SOWA<|>PERSON<|>Carolyn Sowa is a Toledo native studying international law at Beijing University and a panelist in the discussion on Asian-American discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XINREN YU<|>PERSON<|>Xinren Yu is the assistant director for the University of Toledo's center for international studies and programs and a panelist in the discussion on Asian-American discrimination.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AN CHUNG CHENG<|>UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO<|>An Chung Cheng is a Spanish professor at the University of Toledo, where she discusses Asian-American discrimination<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP ANTI-ASIAN HATE<|>AN CHUNG CHENG<|>An Chung Cheng is a speaker at the Stop Anti-Asian Hate program<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP HATE AAPI<|>AN CHUNG CHENG<|>An Chung Cheng discusses the issues tracked by Stop Hate AAPI in her presentations<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOSEPH HARA<|>UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO<|>Joseph Hara is the director of the Japanese program at the University of Toledo<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUA LIU SOWA<|>UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO<|>Hua Liu Sowa is an education student at the University of Toledo<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAROLYN SOWA<|>UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO<|>Carolyn Sowa is a Toledo native studying international law at Beijing University, affiliated with the University of Toledo<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XINREN YU<|>UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO<|>Xinren Yu is the assistant director for the University of Toledo's center for international studies and programs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP ANTI-ASIAN HATE<|>UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO<|>The University of Toledo hosts the Stop Anti-Asian Hate program<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>STOP HATE AAPI<|>The shooting rampage in Atlanta is one of the hate incidents tracked by Stop Hate AAPI<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK<|>STOP HATE AAPI<|>The attack on the elderly Asian woman in New York is one of the hate incidents tracked by Stop Hate AAPI<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>STOP HATE AAPI<|>The fatal attack on the Thai immigrant in San Francisco is one of the hate incidents tracked by Stop Hate AAPI<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROOKLYN<|>STOP HATE AAPI<|>The attack on the 89-year-old Chinese woman in Brooklyn is one of the hate incidents tracked by Stop Hate AAPI<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
