Chris Mahurin said. \nOf the 25 hate crimes last year, four were anti-Jewish. \nReports of hate crimes motivated by anti-Black bias were the biggest driver of the local increase; a spike that coincided with a national and local reckoning over disproportionate toll of police violence on Black men and women, and other communities of color. \nStatewide and national data show similar trends. \nTeresa Drenick, the deputy regional director for the Anti-Defamation League's Central Pacific region, said increased sensitivity over racial issues in the wake of the local protests, as well as the rise in attacks on Asian American and Pacific Islander community following the COVID-19 pandemic have likely contributed to the rise in hate crime reporting last year. \n\"Awareness and urgency to make those reports were heightened in the wake of the social justice movement,\" Drenick said. \"And also, coincidentally, the overt nature of hate crimes really exploded.\" \nNews item: An unidentified person or group hijacks a Zoom meeting on homeless solutions hosted by the leadership council of Home Sonoma County on July 10, 2020. The digital intruders repeatedly say anti-Black and anti-Semitic slurs, as well as derogatory comments about the LGBT community. \nHate crimes are defined as offenses that are at least partly motivated by the perpetrator's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity, according to the FBI. \nUnlike hate speech, which directs hatred against a specific group, hate crimes include overt acts of violence, threats, acts of intimidation or plans to commit a crime. \nIn 2020, data from the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office and the county's nine municipal law enforcement agencies showed that 10 cases were related to anti-Black bias; four were anti-Latino; four were anti-Jewish; three were directed at gay men; two were anti-LGBT; one was anti-multiracial; and one involving \"anti-other race/ethnicity/ancestry.\" \nIn 2019, only two of the 11 hate crimes reported to Sonoma County law enforcement agencies were attributed to anti-Black hate, representing a 400% increase. \nBlack residents make up 1.5% of the county's population, according to 2020 U.S. Census data. \nThe number of reported hate crimes in California rose 32% to 1,339 in 2020. When looking at hate crimes related to anti-Black bias, the data shows those crimes increased by 88%, going from 243 in 2019 to 458 in 2020 statewide. \nNationally, hate crimes related to anti-Black bias increased 40% between 2019 and 2020, and the hate crime category was the largest both years, as was the case for \nthe statewide data. \nOverall, hate crimes in the country increased by 40%. \nSheba Person-Whitley, executive director of Sonoma County's Economic Development Board, said she was shocked but not surprised by the increases in anti-Black bias- related crimes. \nHer daughter, who is Black and a member of the LGBT community, has faced in-person and online verbal assaults related to her identity while attending high school in Sonoma County, Person-Whitley said. \nShe was appalled to hear of last year's Zoom hijacking of a Home Sonoma County meeting, an incident that prompted her to rally around two Black government leaders who were in attendance. \n\"Unfortunately, it's almost baked into our culture and our society here in the United States,\" Person-Whitley said. \"We have people on national television saying very bigoted things with no backlash. So, if you have people who already thought that way, they might feel their perspective is validated.\" \nNews item: A Black delivery driver pulls into a curb to drop-off a package in Rohnert Park's E section on June 19, 2020 when a resident begins yelling racial slurs at him and threatens to kill him.
