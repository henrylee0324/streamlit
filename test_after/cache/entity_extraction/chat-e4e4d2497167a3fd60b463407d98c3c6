The killing of so many Asian women, at businesses known to employ Asian workers, was a racial targeting by its very circumstances, they said.\nThey feared for their parents, their grandparents, their friends, their children, themselves. They lamented that hard-won immigrant dreams had been tarnished by hate. Some Asian American women shared their experiences of being dehumanized and fetishized by white men.\nAfter all, the killings happened the same week the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate reported that thousands of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have faced racist verbal and physical assaults since the pandemic began more than a year ago.\nAlso this week, former President Trump again called COVID-19 \"the China virus\" on national television.\nRep. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) is set to testify at a congressional hearing Thursday on the rise in hate crimes against people of Asian descent.\nChu, the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.\nShe laid the eight deaths directly at Trump's feet, as did other Asian Americans.\n\"President Trump clearly stoked the flames of xenophobia against AAPIs with his rhetoric,\" Chu said Wednesday on Capitol Hill during the Democratic Caucus' weekly press conference, by calling the virus \"kung flu\" and the \"Wuhan virus,\" in addition to the \"China virus.\"\n\"And what we saw yesterday is the result of that,\" she said.\nAt least four of the women killed were of Korean descent, and the attacks have been closely covered in Korean-language media.\nAt the Korean supermarket H Mart in Garden Grove, some shoppers debated the suspect's motives.\nSome wondered why there hasn't been more focus on the shooter's \"racial targets.\"\nWhen asked for their thoughts, several older shoppers turned away.\n\"We don't want to be targets, too,\" one said.\nAt neighboring businesses, people dashed in and out for quick haircuts and steamed tofu lunches.\nElizabeth Choi was choosing a birthday cake for her uncle at the Paris Baguette bakery.\nThe occasional mention of anti-Asian hate incidents within her inner circle seemed \"just like casual talk, until we heard about what the guy did to the spa workers,\" said Choi, who is Korean American.\n\"Why would people want to harm poor workers? Something more aggressive seems to be happening -- yes, we're scared now,\" she said through an interpreter. \"Really scared. Terrified.\"\nThe Brea homemaker, 51, said her daughter advised her not to go to \"too many areas outside of Asian areas.\"\n\"When they're looking for a Chinese face\" to blame the pandemic on, \"any Asian face\" will do, Choi's daughter told her.\nAt the beginning of 2020, when news of the coronavirus was circulating in Asia and Europe but not yet in the United States, Christine Liwag Dixon braced herself for what was to come.\nDixon is mixed-race Filipina and white, a 31-year-old writer who lives in New York City. Family members and friends had shared some of the racist comments about Asians they had endured even in the very early days of the pandemic.\n\"I was afraid to leave the house,\" she said.\nWhen she finally ventured out once last year for a neighborhood walk, she wondered: \"What if they say something? What if they throw something at me?\"\nAs Dixon watched the news of the Atlanta attacks and learned about the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, she cried.\nAll those times, she realized, she wasn't overreacting. When officials said the shootings weren't racially motivated, she laughed in disbelief.\n\"I think that's a load of b--\" she said.\nDixon and other Asian Americans are frustrated that there was not more attention on the issue.\n\"I have felt almost gaslit by the lack of coverage,\" she said. \"I've been sitting here all day wondering, 'Why now? Why today?' We've been talking about this for a year. Why does it take these Asian women being slaughtered for people to suddenly pay attention?\"\nSocial media was charged with such outrage.\n\"In less than 48 hours, we had a historic Asian Oscar moment with multiple firsts in 93 years--then a mass shooting targeting 3 Asian-owned businesses. This is how terrorism works -- you're not allowed to feel safe, accepted, or valued. We can resist. Take up space. Make noise,\" tweeted novelist Min Jin Lee.\n\"Instead of centering a White Supremacist who had a 'sex addiction' (which btw you can also be a racist terrorist simultaneously), remember the real victims yesterday and their families,\" Los Angeles comedian Kristina Wong said in a tweet.\nAnd Rep. Ted Lieu's tweets got angrier as the day went on.\nAt 8:27 a.m., the Torrance Democrat targeted Trump and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
