She's seen a rise in discrimination and violence against the Asian American community in Las Vegas over the last year.\nShe said the gunman's motive for the shootings in Atlanta raises the assumption that all Asian-run massage parlors are operating illicitly, which isn't always the case.\n\"These are immigrant women who are just trying to provide for their families,\" Koo said.\nInvestigators said the gunman opened fire at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Georgia on March 16, killing four people and injuring a fifth. He then drove 30 miles to Atlanta and killed four more people at two other spas.\nIn Acworth, the victims included Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan and Daoyou Feng. Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim and Yong Ae Yue were identified Friday by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's office as the four victims of the shootings at two spas in Atlanta.\nThe lone shooting victim who survived the attack, Elcias Hernandez-Ortiz, was hospitalized in intensive care. Authorities have said the gunman was headed to Florida to carry out more shootings at spas there.\nThe man reportedly told investigators he attacked the spas because he wanted to \"eliminate\" the temptation to feed his sexual compulsion. He is facing a total of eight murder charges and one count of assault in connection to all three shootings, USA Today reported.\nThe case has drawn attention to how hate crimes are defined, and a House panel will hold a hearing today addressing the rise in anti-Asian American hate and discrimination. An anti-hate crime bill is likely to come up during the hearing as lawmakers consider their response to the rise in hate.\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) has joined bicameral legislation introduced by Sen. Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) to address the rise of hate crimes and violence targeted at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\nThe COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act would create a Department of Justice position to expedite the review of COVID-19-related hate crimes, provide support for state and local law enforcement to respond to hate crimes as well as work with local and federal partners to mitigate racially discriminatory language used to describe the pandemic, Cortez Masto's office announced this week.\n\"The violence and harassment Asian and Pacific Islander Americans have experienced over the past year is deeply disturbing and we must work together to combat hate and ensure that all perpetrators are brought to justice,\" she said in a prepared statement.\nOda said Asian women have long been the targets of violence, and they have been sexualized and fetishized in American culture. She doesn't believe the shooting was an isolated incident.\n\"We can't understand things as blips or weird, unique, one-off events, but rather they're a part of systematic inequalities and ... racial oppressions,\" she said in a recent interview with the Reno Gazette Journal.\nUnderstanding the history\nAccording to Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks acts of discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, an estimated 3,800 incidents of hate, discrimination or attacks on Asian Americans have been reported from March 2020 through February 2021. That's compared to roughly 100 incidents annually in previous years, according to a USA Today report.\n\"That AAPI report noted that Asian-American women made up about two-thirds of those documented incidents,\" Oda said, adding that many go unreported.\nOda said Asian-Americans have experienced rejection since the Chinese Exclusion Act, which suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers for a period of 10 years. Signed into law in 1882, it was the first act to place broad restrictions on immigration, according to the U.S. Office of the Historian.\nThe Page Law, passed in 1875, also targeted primarily Chinese women brought to the U.S. for \"immoral purposes,\" according to Immigration and Ethnic History Society—a nonprofit organization based in Minnesota that promotes the study of immigration history.\n\"From the start, Asian laws excluded women specifically in these sexualized terms,\" Oda said.\nEventually, the U.S. established military bases in the Pacific and in Asia. Cities then \"popped up\" around the military bases offering services to Americans based there, Oda said.\n\"That included bars, but that also includes sex work,\" Oda said. \"It's not like sex workers and prostitutes followed the (U.S.) Army. This kind of industry was created because of these military bases.\"\nShe said many of those countries were devastated by war, referencing the Korean War, Vietnam War and the war against Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Rape was common around military bases, she said, including among young girls.\n\"The local governments often had limited access to punish the service people, and often had an incentive to hush it up because so much rides on the continuation of American service people putting their money into these local communities via the bodies of these sex workers,\" Oda said.\nWhen the U.S. drew back its troops, some of those women who\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN-OPERATED SPAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asian-operated spas in Atlanta where the fatal shooting occurred, often employing Asian women who provide massage services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>City in Georgia where the shooting at Asian-operated spas took place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEREDITH ODA<|>PERSON<|>Historian and associate professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, who commented on the shootings and anti-Asian sentiment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>PERSON<|>Suspected gunman responsible for the shootings at the spas in Atlanta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOODSTOCK<|>GEO<|>City in Georgia, the hometown of the suspected gunman, Robert Aaron Long)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN MASSAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>One of the Asian massage parlors targeted by the gunman in Acworth, Georgia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACWORTH<|>GEO<|>City in Georgia where the first shooting occurred at Young's Asian Massage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SILVER STATE<|>GEO<|>Nickname for Nevada, where Amy Koo noted a rise in discrimination against Asian Americans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY KOO<|>PERSON<|>Deputy political director for One APIA Nevada who spoke about the rise in discrimination against Asian Americans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELAINA ASHLEY YAUN<|>PERSON<|>One of the victims of the shooting at Young's Asian Massage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL ANDRE MICHELS<|>PERSON<|>One of the victims of the shooting at Young's Asian Massage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>PERSON<|>One of the victims of the shooting at Young's Asian Massage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAOYOU FENG<|>PERSON<|>One of the victims of the shooting at Young's Asian Massage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOON CHUNG PARK<|>PERSON<|>One of the victims of the shootings at the spas in Atlanta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>PERSON<|>One of the victims of the shootings at the spas in Atlanta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNCHA KIM<|>PERSON<|>One of the victims of the shootings at the spas in Atlanta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YONG AE YUE<|>PERSON<|>One of the victims of the shootings at the spas in Atlanta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELCIAS HERNANDEZ-ORTIZ<|>PERSON<|>The lone survivor of the shooting who was hospitalized in intensive care)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>EVENT<|>Legislation aimed at addressing the rise of hate crimes and violence targeted at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO<|>PERSON<|>Senator from Nevada who is involved in legislation to combat hate crimes against Asian Americans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAZIE K.
