The man then stomped the woman's head multiple times while making anti-Asian statements, police said. \nKari was treated at the hospital for a fractured pelvis, Manhattan District Attomey Cy Vance Jr. said. \nBrandon Elliot, 38, was charged with two counts of assault in the second degree as a hate crime, and one count of attempted assault in the first degree as a hate crime, in connection with the attack, according to the DA. \nThe spike in hate crimes nationwide was first seen in March and April of last year at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic amid \"negative stereotyping of Asians relating to the pandemic,\" according to an analysis of official preliminary police data by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. \nWhile hate crimes decreased overall by 7 percent last year, those targeting Asian people rose by nearly 150 percent across 16 of the nation's largest cities in 2020, the analysis found. \nNew York accounted for the largest surge from three in 2019 to 28 in 2020, an 833 percent increase. \nThe uptick in cases prompted the US Senate to pass legislation Thursday targeting anti-Asian hate crimes. \nThe bill, introduced by Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, in March, would direct the Department of Justice to expedite the review of hate crimes related to COVID-19 that were reported to law enforcement agencies and help them establish ways to report such incidents online and perform public outreach. \nIt would also direct the attorney general and the Department of Health and Human Services to issue best-practices guidance on how to mitigate racially discriminatory language in describing the pandemic. - FNA\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
