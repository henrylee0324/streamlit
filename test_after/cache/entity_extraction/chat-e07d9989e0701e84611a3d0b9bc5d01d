Ricky Yang stood behind a folding table with a sign that read \"Protect Chinatown\" the group he established in February as a chaperone service which got off to a slow start. Now the group was setting out on foot patrols in part to raise awareness about its services and to monitor the streets. As volunteers mobilized one older man of Asian descent stopped to ask a question not about safety measures but about the COVID-19 vaccine. Before sending teams out Yang 27 emphasized hypervigilance. Like Main Street Protect Chinatown is focused on safe intervention. \"If someone was punching me in the face I would want someone to step in\" Yang said. \"Now all anyone does is take out their phone and record.\" Among those patrolling that day was Ian Tan a 24-year-old who works in commercial production. Tan has volunteered as a chaperone and also attended Protect Chinatown's first patrol the weekend before. \"I wish I didn't have to do this\" he said sounding exasperated \"but it feels like no one else will.\" Tan led a team of five east along Division Street to patrol the Two Bridges neighborhood. Other groups took on the north and east side of Chinatown. \"The world shouldn't have to have initiatives like this\" Yang said adding that he hopes that one day people will again feel safe in their communities and services like Protect Chinatown's will be unnecessary. \"The whole goal is that it can be dissolved.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
