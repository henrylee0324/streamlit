The nominee faced down criticism from Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz telling her, \"As I look at your record, I see the record of someone who has spent a career as a partisan.\" \nMinnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar questioned Clarke during the hearing, asking the nominee about her views on police reform in the context of the recent police killing of Daunte Wright and George Floyd in Minnesota. \n\"I've not shied away from working with law enforcement,\" Clarke replied. \"I think that there is a lot of common ground to be forged when it comes to issues of police reform accountability and criminal justice reform generally...I look forward to supporting the work of this body as it continues to wrestle with these issues and find pathways to progressive and healthy reforms.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KRISTEN CLARKE<|>PERSON<|>Kristen Clarke is the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the first Senate-confirmed Black woman leader of the division if confirmed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is responsible for enforcing federal statutes prohibiting discrimination and protecting civil rights.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER LAW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is an organization that advocates for civil rights and has been involved in legal efforts against the Trump administration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAUNTE WRIGHT<|>PERSON<|>Daunte Wright was a victim of police violence whose killing has raised issues regarding police reform.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>PERSON<|>George Floyd was a victim of police violence whose death has significantly impacted discussions on police reform and civil rights.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINNESOTA<|>GEO<|>Minnesota is the U.S. state where the police killings of Daunte Wright and George Floyd occurred, prompting discussions on police reform.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress, where the bill regarding statehood will be debated and voted on.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TED CRUZ<|>PERSON<|>Ted Cruz is a Texas Senator who criticized Kristen Clarke during her nomination process.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY KLOBUCHAR<|>PERSON<|>Amy Klobuchar is a Minnesota Senator who questioned Kristen Clarke about her views on police reform during the hearing.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISTEN CLARKE<|>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION<|>Kristen Clarke is nominated to lead the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which focuses on civil rights enforcement.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISTEN CLARKE<|>LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER LAW<|>Kristen Clarke previously led the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, advocating for civil rights.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAUNTE WRIGHT<|>MINNESOTA<|>Daunte Wright was killed in Minnesota, which has sparked discussions on police reform.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>MINNESOTA<|>George Floyd was killed in Minnesota, leading to widespread protests and calls for police reform.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TED CRUZ<|>KRISTEN CLARKE<|>Ted Cruz criticized Kristen Clarke during her nomination process, indicating a contentious relationship.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY KLOBUCHAR<|>KRISTEN CLARKE<|>Amy Klobuchar questioned Kristen Clarke about her views on police reform, showing interest in her stance on the issue.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENATE<|>KRISTEN CLARKE<|>The Senate is responsible for confirming Kristen Clarke's nomination to lead the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
