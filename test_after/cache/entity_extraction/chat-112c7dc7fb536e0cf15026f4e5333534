He literally said to us, \"Wow, you're not like the Asians around here. You don't walk around staring at the ground.\" He then called over other waiters from the rest of the restaurant to come gawk at us. \nTwo waiters actually collided because they were too distracted while staring at us. Our confidence and casual ease were unfamiliar to them. I know they were not being mean-spirited, but I felt like an exotic animal in a zoo. \nSometimes, the comments were not sexualized. There was one middle-aged woman who screamed at us from across the tracks at the Gallery Place-Chinatown Metro station. I recall we were holding plastic grocery bags from Chinatown, probably wearing t-shirts and shorts since it was a hot summer weekend (and unbearably humid for us Californians). \nI mention this because we weren't dressed in attention-getting outfits. We were waiting for the Metro after a morning of shopping in Chinatown. Yet this woman decided to start yelling at us from the other side of the tracks. I don't remember her entire minutes-long diatribe, but what stuck with me was the comment about our hair. \"You think you're so hot with your shiny straight hair.\" \nI stared blankly at her in surprise, as I had struggled for years with changing my flat, stick straight hair into something closer to the big hair popular in the 1980s. I could never get it to feather or hold a curl, despite hours with a curling iron and a ton of Aqua Net. Ultimately, I begged my mom to let me get perms starting at age 11. I longed for full voluminous hair. While I stopped perming my hair by junior year of high school, I still couldn't believe someone would verbally attack us because of it. \nThat incident inside the Metro station was early in the summer, so I was more embarrassed than angry. I worried we were drawing attention from the other Metro riders standing nearby. One of my friends, not wanting to let the insults go unaddressed, yelled back something like, \"Well, at least we don't smell!\" Twenty five years later, the retort makes me chuckle, but at that moment, I had just wanted to sink into the ground and disappear. \nWe had multiple incidents throughout that summer. As the numbers grew, I stopped wondering what I was doing to provoke the others. I stopped being embarrassed. Instead, I was angry. Inhabiting an Asian body seemed to be the only constant. It didn't matter whether I was grocery shopping or walking to the Metro station. It didn't matter whether I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts or office attire. \nI explicitly note this because the unwanted racist and sexualized comments did not stop even if I tried to blend in with others. My Asian features always gave me away. \nI was relieved to return to California when the summer ended, but remained hyper-vigilant for racist, often sexualized harassment. While it happened far less often after returning to areas with a highly visible Asian American and Pacific Islander population, the most disturbing incident to ever happen to me occurred about 20 years ago in Berkeley, CA. \nI was walking from my apartment to the downtown Berkeley BART station. Since I was headed to a summer internship in San Francisco, it was early in the morning and there wasn't much pedestrian traffic yet. A young man on a bicycle suddenly appeared and followed me for several blocks until I got closer to Bancroft Ave (a main thoroughfare where we approached more people). \nI tried to speed walk to get away from him but he just increased his speed on his bike. He continuously commented about my body and what he wanted to do to me, despite my telling him I had a boyfriend and asking him to leave me alone. As he became more graphic, I told him to f— off, threatened to pepper spray him, and then finally just ignored him for the last 2 blocks until he abruptly told me I was a bitch and left. \nDid I think he would actually do me harm? I saw that he clearly enjoyed my discomfort and fear, but he never made a move to close the distance between us so he could actually touch me. He seemed to relish having that power over me. Even now, I still don't know what I could have done differently. \nI remember telling my then-boyfriend, now husband, later that day about how I wish I had thrown my shoe at him. Or maybe I should have rushed at him and pushed him off his bike. As it is, I never wore that outfit again because I cringed every time I saw it. It reminded me how he made me feel so vulnerable and helpless. \n— \nThere were more incidents, but with the exception of one man someone old enough to be my father who slapped my ass as I walked past him on a busy street in Berkeley, none of them involved physical contact. Yet these all remain vivid in my memory even when many other happier memories have faded away. \nI had fewer interactions with random members of the public after I finished my studies, married, and moved to the suburbs. For nearly ten years, I commuted to work via bus. Waiting for the bus, I stood in line in a suburban park-and-ride lot and on a University campus on the other end. This meant I no longer had to deal with street harassment. \nYet even then, as a young mother taking the commuter bus, I had a bus driver yell at me to shut up when I gave instructions in Chinese to an elderly Chinese couple. They didn't know which stop to get off at and had asked me to help them. All three of us sat in shocked silence until we reached the couple's stop and I signaled it was time for them to get off without speaking.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
