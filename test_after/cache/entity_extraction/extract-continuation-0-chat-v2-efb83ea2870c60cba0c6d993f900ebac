A 27-year-old Southeast Asian woman who spoke to the Globe recalled how a stranger pulled a fake gun on her while she was walking to work in Dorchester last May. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous so her family wouldn't worry, said a man was approaching her from the opposite direction when he aimed a bright green firearm at her. He pulled the trigger and the gun clicked. \n“I flinched,\" she said, “and then he kept walking.\" \nShe had always felt safe walking to work, but that moment changed everything. She felt conflicted about calling the police because she was worried about how their presence would affect Black residents in the neighborhood. But her co-workers urged her to report the incident. \nBetween sobs, she tried explaining the incident to police, but the operator on the other end “was confused why I was calling,\" she said. \n“They didn't understand.\" She was transferred to 911 and again, she was questioned why she was even calling when “this is not an emergency.\" “They kept transferring me here and there,\" the woman said. \nThen the call dropped. \nThe only official record of what happened to her is a complaint she filed online with the civil rights division of the state attorney general's office. But “there was no follow-up,\" the woman said. \nShe doesn't own a car, so she still walks to work. But now, she spends more money on rideshares and avoids public transportation because she fears being attacked on a train or bus. \nShe tries to hide her Asian features. \n“I wear sunglasses, I wear caps, I wear hoods,\" she said. “I wear sneakers in case I need to run.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Brookings Institution is a nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, D.C., known for its research and analysis on various social issues, including demographics and public policy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK TIMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York Times is a prominent American newspaper known for its comprehensive news coverage and in-depth reporting on various topics, including social issues and demographics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DORCHESTER<|>GEO<|>Dorchester is a neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, known for its diverse community and urban environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHEAST ASIAN WOMAN<|>PERSON<|>A 27-year-old Southeast Asian woman who experienced a traumatic incident involving a fake gun while walking to work in Dorchester.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The State Attorney General's Office is a government agency responsible for legal matters and civil rights issues within the state, including handling complaints from residents.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTHEAST ASIAN WOMAN<|>DORCHESTER<|>The Southeast Asian woman experienced a traumatic incident while walking in Dorchester, which impacted her sense of safety in the neighborhood.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTHEAST ASIAN WOMAN<|>STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE<|>The Southeast Asian woman filed a complaint online with the civil rights division of the State Attorney General's Office regarding her incident.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION<|>NEW YORK TIMES<|>The Brookings Institution's research and analysis on demographics may be referenced or reported by The New York Times in their articles on social issues.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
