Student leaders drafted a letter with their suggestions - which range from expanding mental health services to creating a multilingual, online hub for students to anonymously report hate incidents - and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond sent it to district superintendents and charter school administrators on Thursday. \n\"It's really hard,\" Hopwood said. \"Acknowledging pain and suffering that victims feel, that we feel vicariously through them, (is) an important step to realize that this is not OK.\" \nJeung said he often spends his day being \"pulled from all sides,\" tending to media requests, working with corporations interested in donating to Stop AAPI Hate and attending listening sessions run by the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and the White \nHouse. \nEach day, he said, he goes through \"the range of emotions, from anger to depression to hope.\" \n\"We're still grieving over the Atlanta shootings. We're still angered by seeing our elderly pushed and shoved,\" Jeung said. \"That's, for me, a real heavy burden to support the community at the moment.\" \nOthers, like San Francisco State University graduate student Boaz Tang, who has been reviewing incident reports for the past year, say they are using their anger to fuel their volunteer work, instead of just stewing. \n\"I'm going to try to do what I can with the opportunities that I have, just so I don't have to sit on my rage and feel numb,\" Tang said. \nAlthough Stop AAPI Hate seeks to uplift Asian American communities during a time of need, the coalition has faced criticism for its name. And some activists say they worry that the focus on anti-Asian hate incidents is getting co-opted in a way that will lead to more police presence and targeting of Black people within Asian American communities. \nJacob Lacuesta, an Asian American Studies graduate student at San Francisco State, said he supports the coalition's efforts but that the name Stop AAPI Hate homogenizes the Asian American community and is a \"complete erasure\" of different Asian identities, leaving out South Asians and Middle Eastern people, among others. \nJeung said naming the organization was not the coalition's top priority. \"We didn't spend a lot of time thinking about or trying to brand ourselves,\" he said. \"We're just trying to address the racism.\" \nAnd though racism against Asian Americans predates the pandemic, Hopwood said the events of the past two years provided an opportunity to \ncreate new solutions. \n\"This did not start when the pandemic did, and it won't end when the pandemic ends,\" she said. \"It's all about taking the energy and a lot of the attention that this issue has gathered in this moment and trying to channel it into long-term, meaningful change.\" \nCalMatters is a nonprofit newsroom committed to explaining California politics andpolicy.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
