Silently walk away? Explain why the words were hurtful? Tell the person off?\nWhat if, as in videos captured across the country, the encounter turns violent?\nInside the elevator, others chimed in and said that COVID had been \"brought here.\" Tang decided to say something.\n\"I would like you to know that I'm vaccinated,\" said Tang, who wanted the woman to hear that she spoke English fluently and without an accent.\n\"I wasn't going to get into a fight in an elevator with this woman, but it was very clear to me that in her eyes, I was a foreigner,\" Tang, 48, who is Chinese American, said later.\nTang, the author of a world affairs book, has endured racist incidents on a weekly basis, even before the pandemic.\nOnce, a group of tourists pulled her out of a cab while telling her to \"go back to squatting on the ground in my pajamas in China.\" Another time, a woman shoved her off a subway train onto the platform and called her a derogatory term for Chinese people. Countless times as she walks down the street, men have shouted, \"Me love you long time,\" \"Ching chong ni hao\" or \"Konichiwa\" and then, when ignored, followed up with expletives.\nA month ago, a woman spit on her in a restaurant bathroom, saying she didn't \"want to get the coronavirus.\"\n\"I think you take it incident by incident. You try to assess whether it's worth it to fight back, whether it's worth it to say something,\" Tang said. \"I have yelled back at racist slurs on the street. When people say things to me, especially if they assume I don't speak English, I have some choice words for them.\"\nBut to respond every time would feel akin to living in a constant state of combat.\n\"If you've been going through this for decades, you go through periods where you're really angry, periods where you're resigned, then you're really angry again, then you're resigned,\" Tang said. \"You sort of go back and forth. ... Mentally, you may always want to fight back and you may always want to speak up, but you get tired.\"\nBefore Los Angeles musician John Bach goes on tour with a new band and crew, he sits them down to \"have the talk\" about racist comments and physical attacks he will probably get -- especially when it's a tour through the Deep South or the Midwest.\nThe 36-year-old, who has been a professional drummer for 17 years and is of Korean descent, has been told, \"I've never seen an Oriental play drums before\" and \"Didn't know a Chinaman can do much else besides math. Let me buy you a beer.\"\nHe ignores the racial stereotypes embedded in the comments and maintains a friendly demeanor.\n\"I usually deflect and ignore statements. I don't respond in anger, ever, unless I have to defend myself, which is pretty rare, although it does happen,\" said Bach, who was born in South Korea and moved to California when he was 6. \"I approach the situation as I would with any other fan. Just keep the mood light, take whatever it is that they say as a compliment.\"\nSome people, including former President Trump, have blamed Asian Americans for the coronavirus because it was first identified in China.\nLast March, Manjusha Kulkarni was in a hair salon when she overheard two white women saying that Asians spread disease because of the food they eat, citing bats. She weighed whether to say something.\n\"There's a social etiquette of not challenging things,\" said Kulkarni, the executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and the co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate. \"We're socialized not to say things to people. It's rude. It's potentially disrespectful.\"\nSo Kulkarni said, shaking as she did: \"I apologize for interrupting your conversation. I have to tell you what you're saying is inaccurate.\"\n\"I thought that was the mildest thing I could say and still, their answer to me was, 'You misunderstood what we were saying,' \" Kulkarni recalled.\nAlong with the trauma suffered in the moment, there are the lingering questions: Could I have said something differently? What if I had said this instead?\n\"I would feel worse not doing something than doing something, but that's in environments that were still safe,\" Kulkarni said. \"If you asked me, 'Would I do it alone around a big man?' No, I would not.\"\nWhen Jackie Louie was a student at Cal Poly San Luis Obis\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
