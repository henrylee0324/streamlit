Atlanta police said Wednesday that it was too early to determine the motive; Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said the suspect told authorities he had a sex addiction.Even if the incident is not determined to be racially motivated, community leaders and experts say a series of violent attacks this year and a rise in hate incidents are fueled by racist rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic and are \"distinct but related trends.\"\"Asian American communities were already set on edge. We were alarmed by the rate of violence and hate directed towards us,\" said Russell Jeung, who created Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks incidents against Asian American Pacific Islander communities. \"The shooting is again the worst type of violence we could go through. ... It can't continue.\"More: Will Atlanta shootings spur action on anti-Asian hate crime laws?Spa shootings: Suspect arrested after 8 people killed; most victims were AsianVice President Kamala Harris, who is African American and Asian American, told reporters Wednesday that the \"tragic\" shooting speaks to a larger problem of violence in America.“The investigation is ongoing, we don’t yet know, we’re not yet clear about the motive,\" she said. \"But I do want to say to our Asian American community that we stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and outraged all people.”U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., offered his condolences to the victim's family's on Twitter, highlighting that the shootings occurred during a spike in anti-Asian violence. Lieu said racist phrases used by former President Donald Trump\"At this very moment, so many of them, our fellow Americans, are on the front lines of this pandemic trying to save lives,\" Biden said. \"And still, still they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It's wrong, it's un-American and it must stop.\"Biden signed a memorandum in late January denouncing xenophobia and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Lawmakers from the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a group of lawmakers representing the interests of Asian Americans, have requested a meeting with the administration to discuss the orders' implementation, though the meeting has not yet been scheduled.'It's wrong, it's un-American': President Biden denounces attacks against Asian AmericansMore: Lawmakers to introduce anti-hate crime legislation amid rise in anti-Asian hate and violenceDemocratic lawmakers plan to introduce a bill addressing the rise in hate incidents directed at Asian Americans amid the pandemic. The bill, a revised version of legislation introduced but not passed in the last Congress, would create a new position at the Department of Justice to facilitate the review of hate crimes and provide oversight of hate crimes related to COVID-19.Jeung said expanding ethnic studies, civil rights protections, restorative justice models, linguistically appropriate mental health and trauma resources, and neighborhood watch programs are necessary to address the range of racism the community is facing.\"We need a whole government approach that’s comprehensive to uproot the racism we’re experiencing and the violence,\" he said.On Thursday, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will hold a hearing on “discrimination and violence against Asian Americans.\"John C. Yang, president and CEO of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC, who is expected to testify before the subcommittee, said on Twitter that the hearing \"became even more important\" Tuesday night.\"Our community needs to feel protected, and policymakers must hear and address our concerns,\" he said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in the United States where the shootings occurred, leading to increased fear in the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN COMMUNITY<|>GEO<|>The Asian community in the U.S. has been experiencing a rise in violence and hate incidents, particularly in the wake of the shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>PERSON<|>Russell Jeung is a community leader who created Stop AAPI Hate, an organization tracking incidents against Asian American Pacific Islander communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that tracks incidents of hate and violence against Asian American Pacific Islander communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>PERSON<|>Kamala Harris is the Vice President of the United States, who spoke about the tragic shooting and its implications for violence in America.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TED LIEU<|>PERSON<|>Ted Lieu is a U.S. Representative from California who offered condolences to the victims' families and highlighted the rise in anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States who denounced xenophobia and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONGRESSIONAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN CAUCUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus is a group of lawmakers representing the interests of Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties is holding a hearing on discrimination and violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTI-HATE CRIME LEGISLATION<|>EVENT<|>Legislation aimed at addressing the rise in hate incidents directed at Asian Americans amid the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSELL JEUNG<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Russell Jeung created Stop AAPI Hate to track incidents against Asian American Pacific Islander communities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>ASIAN COMMUNITY<|>Kamala Harris expressed solidarity with the Asian community in light of the shootings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TED LIEU<|>ASIAN COMMUNITY<|>Ted Lieu highlighted the impact of the shootings on the Asian community and offered condolences<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>ASIAN COMMUNITY<|>Joe Biden denounced violence against the Asian community and addressed their fears<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONGRESSIONAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN CAUCUS<|>ANTI-HATE CRIME LEGISLATION<|>The caucus is involved in introducing legislation to combat hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOUSE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE<|>ANTI-HATE CRIME LEGISLATION<|>The subcommittee is holding a hearing related to the proposed anti-hate crime legislation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN COMMUNITY<|>ATLANTA<|>The shootings in Atlanta have significantly affected the Asian community, increasing their sense of fear<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
