The column of\ndemonstrators lined up behind a banner that read, “March For Our Asian Futures.\"\nSophia Wu, 38, a demonstrator from the Fenway, held a sign that said, “People need to stop confusing xenophobia\nwith patriotism.\"\nShe said moved to the United States from Taiwan about 18 years ago, but has felt like a foreigner here for her\nentire life.\n“This is something that really affects my life,\" Wu said.\nThe event was organized by Asian Coalition Massachusetts, which a group of young activists formed last month\nafter a gunman killed eight people at Atlanta-area spas, including six women of Asian descent. Investigators have\nsaid the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, who is white, confessed to the killings.\nOrganizers from Asian Coalition Massachusetts said they want marginalized people within the Asian community to\nhave a voice, and they detailed policy objectives including fighting gentrification, cutting budgets for police\nagencies, and decriminalizing sex work.\n“Today is not the only day that we're going to resist, right?\" Joan Dotruong, an organizer from Dorchester, asked\nthe crowd. “We're going to resist until we get our demands met!\"\nThe crowd included three sisters from North Andover who attended the event with their parents.\nOne sister, Grace Truong, 20, held a sign that read, “Not your model minority, scapegoat, fetish.\"\nMedia depictions of Asian women as exotic and submissive have received renewed scrutiny since the spa\nshootings and revelations that Long claimed to have a sex addiction and targeted what he saw as sources of\ntemptation. The police account of Long's claims generated backlash, though investigators have said they're still\nworking to establish a motive, including looking into whether the attacks can be classified as hate crimes.\n“No one should be fetishized because of their race or how they look,\" Truong said.\nHer sister Linzie, a junior at North Andover High School, held a sign that read, “We are not silent. But are you\nlistening?\" She said there is a misconception that Asian people are timid.\n“We're being overridden by other voices and we don't get the space to really promote ourselves,\" she said.\nSam Lê Shave, a volunteer with the Asian American Resource Workshop, spoke out against immigration policies\nthat harm the Asian community.\n“As we've seen it play out through racist policies throughout history, time and time again, here in the un-United\nStates, immigrants and refugees to now deportees, alongside many other marginalized people, have been\ndehumanized beyond measure in the face of white supremacy,\" she said. “Our communities have been stripped of\nresources and deprived and left with nothing. This is not the land of the free. This is not the land of dreams. This is\nstolen land.\"\nThe crowd applauded.\nShave also called on the crowd to fight racism directed at Black people.\n“We must also address the anti-Blackness within our communities,\" she said. “This is the time to come together,\nstand up for one another. Especially in times of injustice, we must show up and show out, and we cannot allow\nwhite supremacy to pit us against each other, because when structural racism affects one of us, it affects all of\nus.\"\nMany blame the latest wave of anti-Asian bias on Donald Trump and the xenophobic rhetoric he used to link\nCOVID-19 to China, though discrimination against Asian people in the United States stretches back more than 100\nyears.\nThe national coalition Stop AAPI Hate received 96 reports from Massachusetts of anti-Asian hate and\ndiscrimination between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, according to data released last month. Nationwide, the group\nreceived 3,795 reports of anti-Asian incidents during the same period, it said.\nIn Quincy, two separate rallies opposing anti-Asian hate were held at City Hall.\nBoth drew supporters demanding an end to racism, while people also called for unity and offered full-throated\nsupport to members of the city's Asian-American community.\nThe “Stand Up, Speak Out! Pan-Asian Solidarity Rally,\" held Saturday afternoon, was organized by Quincy For\nTransformative Change and other local organizations. Speakers discussed past experiences of racism and voiced\nfear about the prospect of violence directed at Asian Americans.\nThey emphasized common cause with other communities, including Black Americans, who have experienced\nracism and violence because of white supremacy.\nBen Hires, chief executive at the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, highlighted efforts by Quincy residents\nto create a city department of social justice and equity, as well as state legislative measures, including new\neducational programs, to help combat racism.\nHe also called for broader investments in creating access to jobs, housing, health care, and other services for\ncommunities of color.\n“We need to center transformative justice that begins with cross-racial justice, and community building that\naddresses white supremacy as the root cause of violence and hate,\" Hires told participants.\nEarlier in the day, people gathered at Quincy City Hall for the “Fight Anti-Asian Hate\" solidarity event organized by\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DORCHESTER<|>GEO<|>Dorchester is a neighborhood in Boston where demonstrators gathered to protest against racism towards people of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUINCY CITY HALL<|>GEO<|>Quincy City Hall is a location where rallies opposing anti-Asian hate were held.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN COALITION MASSACHUSETTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asian Coalition Massachusetts is a group of young activists formed to advocate for marginalized voices within the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETERS PARK<|>GEO<|>Peters Park is a location in the South End where a rally took place during the demonstrations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is the destination of the march organized by demonstrators advocating against racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOPHIA WU<|>PERSON<|>Sophia Wu is a demonstrator from the Fenway who expressed her feelings about racism and xenophobia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>PERSON<|>Robert Aaron Long is the suspect in the Atlanta-area spa shootings that sparked protests against anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRACE TRUONG<|>PERSON<|>Grace Truong is a 20-year-old demonstrator who participated in the rally and held a sign against stereotypes of Asian people.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINZIE TRUONG<|>PERSON<|>Linzie Truong is a junior at North Andover High School and a demonstrator who spoke about the misconceptions of Asian people.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAM LÊ SHAVE<|>PERSON<|>Sam Lê Shave is a volunteer with the Asian American Resource Workshop who spoke against harmful immigration policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a national coalition that tracks incidents of anti-Asian hate and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON CHINATOWN NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center is an organization that focuses on community support and social justice for the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN COALITION MASSACHUSETTS<|>SOPHIA WU<|>Sophia Wu participated in the demonstrations organized by Asian Coalition Massachusetts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN COALITION MASSACHUSETTS<|>GRACE TRUONG<|>Grace Truong participated in the demonstrations organized by Asian Coalition Massachusetts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN COALITION MASSACHUSETTS<|>LINZIE TRUONG<|>Linzie Truong participated in the demonstrations organized by Asian Coalition Massachusetts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>ASIAN COALITION MASSACHUSETTS<|>The formation of Asian Coalition Massachusetts was a response to the violence perpetrated by Robert Aaron Long<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOPHIA WU<|>DORCHESTER<|>Sophia Wu demonstrated in Dorchester to protest against racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRACE TRUONG<|>QUINCY CITY HALL<|>Grace Truong attended the rally at Quincy City Hall to protest against anti-Asian hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINZIE TRUONG<|>QUINCY CITY HALL<|>Linzie Truong attended the rally at Quincy City Hall to protest against anti-Asian hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAM LÊ SHAVE<|>ASIAN COALITION MASSACHUSETTS<|>Sam Lê Shave spoke at the demonstrations organized by Asian Coalition Massachusetts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ASIAN COALITION MASSACHUSETTS<|>Asian Coalition Massachusetts aligns with the mission of Stop AAPI Hate to combat anti-Asian discrimination<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOSTON CHINATOWN NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER<|>QUINCY CITY HALL<|>Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center participated in the events at Quincy City Hall advocating for the Asian community<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
