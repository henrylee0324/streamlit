My work has been dedicated to making this community visible,\" Fu says. \n\"The level of anxiety continues to grow and grow. Asian spas and salons are easier targets,\" often identifiable by exterior signage in other languages, Fu adds. \"Now, they're going to be afraid for the their lives.\"\nHong Dinh, 38, moved to the United States from Saigon in 2003. She's helped support herself and three children doing nails for 15 years. The dream was to open her own salon with her sister in San Jose - which she realized this month, her grand opening on March 15.\nThe next day, the killing rampage occurred in Atlanta.\nThe following day, Dinh ordered a steel front door for protection and closed the salon.\nIt will remain locked until the door can be installed and she feels safe that her salon won't be a target.\n\"I'm sad. I'm sad for the whole world,\" says Dinh, through an interpreter. \"I think this is the beginning of the attacks. People are mad because of covid. There's anger in them. They've been stuck at home for a year now. It also depends where they get their news from.\"\nRachel Yoon, 59, who immigrated from Korea, owns a salon in Manhattan's Washington Heights. Nail salons have long been places where women of varied backgrounds gather. The majority of Yoon's clientele are Dominican. They've been great. But she's heard unseemly comments, often from White people who are strangers.\nOutside the salon, she attempts to blend in. \"I feel, thankfully, when we are wearing masks, sometimes people can't distinguish. Sometimes they can. It's definitely something you feel in the air,\" she says on the phone, driving from her home in Queens to her salon. \"I worry about my niece, my sisters, in the subways. I'm always afraid.\"\nShe sticks to her routine and feels relatively safe. \"I tell my kids if someone approaches you and says something bad, just ignore them. You cannot confront them,\" says Yoon, who has two grown daughters. \"I'm not going to any places I'm not familiar with. I'm being careful until this thing goes away. Everyone is warning each other, 'don't look at someone in the eye.' \"\nWills, in Denver, feels something else must be done. Let Atlanta be instructive. Look at the increase in violent incidents. On March 18, two days after the shootings, Xiao Zhen Xie, 75, was brutally beaten in San Francisco but fought back her attacker. A GoFundMe campaign launched by her grandson has raised nearly $1 million dollars; the family plans to donate almost all of it, less Xie's medical expenses, to combat racism in the community. \n\"I feel like I have to be more outspoken. To tell people, 'Don't forget about me,' \" Wills says. \nShe's talking. Wills is sharing her anger and frustrations on social media and in her community. She's considering running for public office, possibly the state legislature, where she isn't represented by people who look like her or share her experiences. \nKeeping her head down isn't in Wills's nature and, as she will tell you, staying quiet isn't working.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
