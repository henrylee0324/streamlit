During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, inflammatory and xenophobic rhetoric has put Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) persons, families, communities, and businesses at risk.\" \nIndicting the Trump administration, the memo continued, \"The Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin. Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.\" \nBiden called on the federal government to combat racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against AAPI and to ensure that all members of AAPI communities - no matter their background, the language they speak, or their religious beliefs - are treated with dignity and equity. \nActs of intolerance against AAPI, or for that matter, any other race, are neither unusual nor specific to America. Colonialism, slavery, genocide, and caste/class systems have soiled the legacy of all nations and societies. The burden on us collectively as humanity is to work harder to eliminate the incidence and intensity of such ethno- centric exclusion, discrimination, devaluation, endangerment and extinction. But remedies that begin and end with renaming an epidemic from Wuhan or China to Covid remain cosmetic. Societies don't suddenly erupt into or embrace racism because of a singular occurrence of a pandemic. \nWe are racists principally because we are different, and regardless of what religious and political preachers prescribe, we continue to define ourselves in relation to \"others.\" Crimes against Asian Americans (AA), like crimes against other peoples and races, are embedded in the vaults of history. But so are crimes by AAs against each other or in other centuries and places, against religious and ethnic groups from other regions of \nthe world. \nA recent item circulating in social media regrets the targeting of AA in American cities but also notes how mutual hatred is the common thread of global sociology and history: The Chinese hate Japanese, Koreans hate Japanese, Laotians hate Vietnamese, Thais hate Burmese, Burmese hate Indians, Indians hate Pakistanis, Bangladeshis hate Pakistanis and Indians, and so on. Such mutually mistrusting and hating nations are the reality also of Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. The unifying factor is that all the above hate America! As China expects to replace America as the world's leading power, China inevitably will replace the U.S. as the most hated global power. \nTo lump all people from Asia and Pacific as AAPI, or all Latin Americans as Hispanics, overlooks these intrinsic divides among them, and the harm that each of the minorities within the larger minority ethnicity historically, traditionally, and currently inflict on their underprivileged segments. \nThe recent claim to ascendancy of Blacks as the world's greatest victims has caused the grievances of all other colors and shades within those colors to be sidelined or overlooked. Its other flaw is that it has put Whites as the sole perpetrators of color and race-based injustices. \nThis 'rush to judgment' stance appeared instantly in the wake of the horrific Atlanta shootings of eight innocents by a crazed, seriously troubled and mentally deranged youngster. The shootings occurred in three different spas/massage parlors. Of the eight victims, six of the dead were Asian women and one a White male. The eighth was a Hispanic male who survived the shooting and is hospitalized in intensive care. That the spas were mainly staffed and run by Asians would inevitably account for their bearing the brunt of mortality It is notable that a brother of the White male who was killed spoke of his and their family's loss but appealed to the people to not make the tragedy about race. The incident is vicious enough without adding to it the venom of ethnicity. \nAddressing the media following the arrest of the shooter, a spokes-person of the County Sheriff's Office clarified that while claiming responsibility for the shootings, the shooter denied any racial hatred and told police he believed he had a sex addiction, and that he saw the spas as \"a temptation... that he wanted to eliminate.\" \nBut that gave scant solace to race-agitators who increasingly seek to blame every crime on white suprema- cism. In earlier situations such as in the ramming of 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee during his morning walk in his San Francisco neighborhood, resulting in his death two days later, even though the District Attorney charged the perpetrator with murder and elder abuse causing death, but not racism, the Indian American director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council was quick to claim: \"These attacks taking place in the Bay Area are part of a larger trend of anti-Asian American/Pacific Islander hate brought on in many ways by COVID-19, as well as some of the xenophobic policies and racist rhetoric that were pushed forward by the prior administration.\" \n- \nIt is undeniable that crime - civil, criminal, and racial in the Covid era, especially following 'defund police' initiatives, has grown astronomically But politicians and media show unprincipled and unprecedented \nenthusiasm to grasp the race straw with the clear intent to divide races in order to conquer them. \nThat AAs have experienced a surge in crimes against them is also not disputed. According to a Stop AAPI Hate, 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents -most directed at women - were reported in 2020 (1,200 more than the previous year). But it is also true that federal data,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States who issued a memorandum addressing the safety and security of Asian American and Pacific Islander communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to increased xenophobia and hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUMP ADMINISTRATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Trump administration is the previous U.S. government that has been criticized for its role in promoting xenophobic sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER<|>PERSON<|>Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) refers to individuals and communities of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who have faced increased discrimination and violence during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA SHOOTINGS<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta shootings refer to a tragic incident where eight individuals, primarily Asian women, were killed in spas/massage parlors, raising concerns about race and violence against AAPI communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old Asian American man who was killed in a racially motivated attack in San Francisco.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The County Sheriff's Office is the law enforcement agency that responded to the Atlanta shootings and clarified the shooter's motivations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC POLICY AND PLANNING COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council is an organization that advocates for the rights and safety of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, particularly in response to hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Joe Biden addressed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AAPI communities in his memorandum<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUMP ADMINISTRATION<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The Trump administration's actions during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to xenophobic sentiments against AAPI individuals<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased discrimination and violence against AAPI communities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA SHOOTINGS<|>ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER<|>The Atlanta shootings involved primarily Asian women, highlighting the violence faced by AAPI individuals<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE<|>The County Sheriff's Office investigated the attack that led to the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE<|>ATLANTA SHOOTINGS<|>The County Sheriff's Office responded to the Atlanta shootings and provided clarification on the shooter's motivations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN PACIFIC POLICY AND PLANNING COUNCIL<|>ATLANTA SHOOTINGS<|>The Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council commented on the implications of the Atlanta shootings for AAPI communities<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
