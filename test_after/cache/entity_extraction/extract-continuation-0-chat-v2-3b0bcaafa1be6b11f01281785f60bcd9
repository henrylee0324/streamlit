In one instance an undercover officer who is of Asian descent was approached by a man on a train platform in Queens. The man waved his hand and hat in the officer's face and said \"That's why you peoples are getting beat up\" according to a police report. He was charged with aggravated harassment as a hate crime in April. Another officer was approached by a man in midtown Manhattan who shouted anti-Asian slurs at him and said \"Go back to China before you end up in the graveyard\" using an expletive police said. He was also charged with harassment and menacing as a hate crime.Although it has decreased the use of undercover officers the Police Department continues to maintain a hate crimes task force that specifically deals with anti-Asian incidents. From March 1 to March 30 for example that group made 27 arrests in attacks or harassment against Asian American victims in the city 22 of them were recorded as hate crimes within the Police Department. And in 23 of those 27 incidents people accused in the attacks had previously encountered law enforcement because they appeared to be having mental health episodes according to statistics provided by the police. As in Chappell's case many of those 27 incidents involve the same person. One person was responsible for four separate incidents police said.Stewart Loo a deputy inspector who led the task force for its first 10 months of existence said the unit did not solely investigate hate crimes. The 25 detectives involved also provided help to other units when they investigated crimes that involved Asian victims who did not speak fluent English. Loo who retired this spring said that leading the task force had been demanding. He and the group's other members were not paid for the volunteer hours they put in - instead they worked their normal shifts in addition to their work with the force.For those who work and live in neighborhoods like Manhattan's Chinatown it is tempting to see the city's recovery and assume the worst is over. Md Ali 31 said he had sometimes been nervous in the spring and in the height of the pandemic but his souvenir shop at Mott and Bayard streets was near a police precinct so he felt safe. \"Business picked back up a little bit\" he said. \"If it stays like this maybe we can survive.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>QUEENS<|>GEO<|>Queens is a borough of New York City where incidents of anti-Asian harassment occurred on train platforms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIDTOWN MANHATTAN<|>GEO<|>Midtown Manhattan is an area in New York City where anti-Asian slurs were shouted at law enforcement officers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Police Department maintains a hate crimes task force that deals specifically with anti-Asian incidents and has made numerous arrests related to hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HATE CRIMES TASK FORCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Hate Crimes Task Force is a specialized unit within the Police Department that investigates hate crimes, particularly those against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEWART LOO<|>PERSON<|>Stewart Loo is a deputy inspector who led the Hate Crimes Task Force for its first 10 months and retired in the spring.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MD ALI<|>PERSON<|>Md Ali is a 31-year-old shop owner in Chinatown who expressed feelings of nervousness during the pandemic but felt safe due to proximity to a police precinct.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in Manhattan where residents and business owners have been affected by anti-Asian incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCH 1 TO MARCH 30<|>EVENT<|>This period saw 27 arrests made by the Hate Crimes Task Force in response to attacks or harassment against Asian American victims.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>HATE CRIMES TASK FORCE<|>The Hate Crimes Task Force operates under the Police Department to address and investigate hate crimes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEWART LOO<|>HATE CRIMES TASK FORCE<|>Stewart Loo led the Hate Crimes Task Force during its initial months of operation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MD ALI<|>CHINATOWN<|>Md Ali operates a souvenir shop in Chinatown and has experienced the impact of anti-Asian incidents<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HATE CRIMES TASK FORCE<|>MARCH 1 TO MARCH 30<|>The Hate Crimes Task Force made 27 arrests during this specific time frame for hate crimes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEENS<|>POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>The Police Department responded to incidents of harassment that occurred in Queens<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIDTOWN MANHATTAN<|>POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>The Police Department addressed incidents of anti-Asian slurs that occurred in Midtown Manhattan<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
