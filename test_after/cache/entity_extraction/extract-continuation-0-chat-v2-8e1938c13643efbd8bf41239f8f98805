I could write 10,000 words on so many topics said just now, but suffice to say on this one: I think preferences are real. I also think you can leave race out when expressing them, and you can thoughtfully consider what influenced you to have those preferences in the first place.\n\"Stop Asian Hate\" is a movement we're talking about now because six Asian women were gunned down in an Atlanta spa. The circumstances are grim, disheartening, and sadly unsurprising in a country where our last president stoked the fire by calling COVID the \"China- virus,\" which encouraged what looked to me to be a bipartisan blame toward Wuhan on the entire global pandemic.\nThe women killed came from a diverse background, not just China- I'm writing about that country specifically because that's been my personal experience. With \"Stop Asian Hate\" though, I focused on the word \"hate\" rather than \"violence.\" The movement sparked within me these long-held bitter feelings I've felt about so many people around me who are supposedly progressive, but carry these racial biases as if it's common and fine. It isn't.\nIf you're reading this column for the first time today, I am supposed to write about local cocktails and nightlife. So I'm sorry-but just a little bit-that I took such a sharp turn into rant territory. I hope you've reached out with kindness to Asian friends recently, and if you don't have any, go make one today. Support your Asian businesses. Be thoughtful of how you treat others.\nI end today with a Chinese Mai Tai, which I first experienced at Li Po Cocktail Lounge (916 Grant Ave.) many years ago. They're closed now, so I found this recipe in an archived story from 2012 that the San Francisco Examiner did on their famous cocktail. You better believe I'll write a fresh profile of them once they reopen.\nBar Info: Li Po Cocktail Lounge,\n916 Grant Ave., S.F. (415) 982-0072\nChinese Mai Tai\nPrepared by Daniel Choi To note: I've seen variations of this particular recipe on Reddit, and it could have been updated since we published it nearly 10 years ago. Ingredients:\n* 1 scoop of crushed ice\n* 1 ounce Castillo light rum\n* 1 ounce Whaler's dark rum\n* 1 ounce Bacardi 151\n* 1 ounce Baijiu (Chinese liquor distilled from sorghum)\n* 2 ounces pineapple juice\nDirections: Pulse all ingredients in a blender for five seconds. Serve in tall cocktail glass. Garnish with a lime wedge.\nSaul Sugarman is a San Francisco-based writer, event producer and apparel designer; visit him atsaulsugarman.com.
