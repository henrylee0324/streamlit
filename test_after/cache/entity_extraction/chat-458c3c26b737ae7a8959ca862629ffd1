The group said Asian Americans have been blamed for the pandemic and connected the attacks to racist rhetoric from politicians, including former President Donald Trump.Sam Hu, a second-generation Korean American visiting Atlanta this week, spent early Wednesday morning trying to make sense of what happened.“The problem seems so insurmountable. I don’t even know where to try to begin. I think that’s why I’m so sad. It’s random, but it’s not. It’s premeditated, but it’s not. ... I’m worried because it could happen anywhere.”Hu said he believes Tuesday’s shootings are hate crimes. He wants local, state and federal officials to move fast to categorize them as such. To not do so would be the latest disservice to Asian Americans, he said.\"I just couldn’t help but think that, like, that could have been me, my parents, my friends, my loved ones,\" Hu said.Stop AAPI Hate tracked nearly 3,800 incidents of hate, discrimination or attacks on Asian Americans from March 2020 through February 2021. At least 48 incidents have occurred in Georgia, the group said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the \"horrific shootings\" and administration officials have been in contact with the mayor’s office and the FBI.Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in South Korea on Wednesday morning to meet with Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong. He acknowledged the shooting and the fact that four of the victims were believed to be of Korean descent. “We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere,” Blinken said.Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said in a tweet he appreciated law enforcement's \"quick apprehension\" of Long.\"Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence,\" the governor said.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
