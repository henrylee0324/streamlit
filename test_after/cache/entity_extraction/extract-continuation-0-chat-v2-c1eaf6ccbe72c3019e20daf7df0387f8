At least four of the six women were of Korean descent, like Kim. \n“It was clear to me this was not just a random attack on just regular small businesses,\" Kim said. “It appeared, based on what we're seeing, that this likely may have been a lot more targeted toward the Asian community and specifically, Asian women.\" \nThe suspect in custody — a 21-year-old white man named Robert Aaron Long — claimed he was not motivated by racism. But to many Asian Americans, Tuesday's deadly rampage felt like the culmination of a year in which anti-Asian racism has soared. \nIn the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Asian Americans have been insulted, harassed, spat upon, shunned, beaten, and killed. The organization Stop AAPI Hate has recorded nearly 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide since last March, when the group first started tracking the attacks. More than two-thirds of the victims, the group noted, were women. \nLaw enforcement officials have said that Long claimed he was motivated by “sexual addiction,\" but investigators are not ruling out the role anti-Asian bias might have played. Long has been charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. \nFour of the victims who were killed have been identified: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. \nRegardless of the motive, the slayings have rattled many Asian Americans, still reeling from the recent and highly publicized assaults on Asian elders in California and New York. On Jan. 28, an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee was brutally beaten during his morning walk in San Francisco. He died of his injuries days later. \nEarlier this month, an 83-year-old Korean women in White Plains, N.Y., was struck so hard she blacked out. \nAs she processed the news, Kim thought of her Korean parents, small-business owners in New Jersey, and her near constant worry for their safety. And she was reminded of an incident last March, at the beginning of the pandemic, when a middle-aged white woman snarled at her to “go back to where [she] came from\" as they passed each other in the Seaport. \n“That comment sat with me for days and weeks to come,\" said Kim, secretary of the Massachusetts Asian American Commission. “Every once in a while, I'll think back to that moment.\" \nThis past year of sickness, isolation, and death has been emotionally and psychologically taxing for nearly everyone, but for Asian Americans, grief and anxiety have been compounded by anti-Asian sentiment fueled by the pandemic. Civil rights groups have accused former president Donald Trump of stoking the flames of hate when he referred to the coronavirus as the “China virus\" or “Kung flu.\" But the history of anti-Asian racism is much longer. \nHistorian Ellen Wu, director of the Asian American Studies Program at Indiana University, said Tuesday's killings stem from a wretched tradition of discrimination against Asian women, who are stereotyped not only as passive and submissive, but as hypersexual and exotic. \nThe fetishization of Asian women began with the Page Law of 1875, the first federal statute to restrict immigration to the United States. The law was ostensibly aimed at preventing Chinese prostitutes from entering the country, but in practice, it excluded virtually all Chinese women, Wu said. During and after the Korean\nWar, American soldiers regularly frequented Asian sex workers — women, Wu notes, who “didn't have a lot of options\" in countries devastated by war. \nFrom “Madame Butterfly\" to “Sayonara,\" theimage of the feminine, sexual, and subservient Asian woman has been recycled generation after generation in popular culture, Wu said, and consequently, has become “embedded in our collective cultural imagination.\" And so for many Asian American women, it's impossible to separate the Georgia shooter's apparent misogyny from the specter of racism. \n“There is often a lot of unchecked, invisible violence that exists for Asian women, whether it's because of their race, or because of their immigration status, or the type of industry they're in,\" said Lisette Le, executive director of VietAID, a Fields Corner nonprofit that primarily serves Vietnamese nail salon workers. \n“They can be seen as disposable.\" \nBoston City Councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu, a daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, recounted in a statement her own experiences with anti-Asian racism following Tuesday's attacks. \n“Some of my most vivid childhood memories involve racist encounters with strangers,\" she wrote. “People who knew nothing about me except for my appearance feeling empowered to pull eyes into slits, or to chant ching chong sounds.\" \nShe also described “that constant feeling of needing to be aware, ready, on guard whenever out in public.\" \nAsian Americans represent about 7 percent of the population in Massachusetts. In the United States, Asians make up about 6 percent of the population, up from about 2 percent in 1980, William Frey, chief demographer at the Brookings Institution, told The New York Times. \nFeelings like those experienced by Wu are not uncommon among Asian American women. A 27-year-old Southeast Asian woman who spoke to the Globe recalled how a stranger pulled a fake gun on her while she was walking to work in Dorchester last May. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous so her family wouldn't worry, said a man was approaching her from the opposite direction when he aimed a bright green firearm at\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DANIELLE KIM<|>PERSON<|>Danielle Kim is a member of the Asian community who expressed her concerns regarding the targeted attacks on Asian women in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>PERSON<|>Robert Aaron Long is the 21-year-old suspect in custody for the shootings at three spas in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that tracks anti-Asian hate incidents and has recorded nearly 3,800 incidents since March 2020.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the city where the series of shootings occurred, resulting in the deaths of eight people, including six Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOREAN DESCENT<|>GEO<|>Refers to individuals of Korean heritage, several of whom were victims in the Atlanta shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old Thai man who was brutally beaten in San Francisco and later died from his injuries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICHELLE WU<|>PERSON<|>Michelle Wu is a Boston City Councilor and mayoral candidate who shared her experiences with anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIANA UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Indiana University is where historian Ellen Wu works, focusing on Asian American studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES PROGRAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian American Studies Program at Indiana University studies the history and experiences of Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIELDS CORNER<|>GEO<|>Fields Corner is a neighborhood in Boston where VietAID, a nonprofit organization serving Vietnamese nail salon workers, is located.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIETAID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>VietAID is a nonprofit organization that primarily serves Vietnamese nail salon workers in Boston.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANIELLE KIM<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>Danielle Kim expressed her concerns about the targeted nature of the attacks committed by Robert Aaron Long<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ATLANTA<|>Stop AAPI Hate recorded incidents of anti-Asian hate, including those related to the shootings in Atlanta<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>ATLANTA<|>Robert Aaron Long is the suspect in the shootings that occurred in Atlanta<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>ATLANTA<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee's death is part of the broader context of violence against Asian Americans, including the Atlanta shootings<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHELLE WU<|>DANIELLE KIM<|>Both Michelle Wu and Danielle Kim have spoken out about their experiences with anti-Asian racism following the Atlanta shootings<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIANA UNIVERSITY<|>ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES PROGRAM<|>The Asian American Studies Program is a part of Indiana University, focusing on the history and issues faced by Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIETAID<|>FIELDS CORNER<|>VietAID is a nonprofit organization located in Fields Corner, serving the local Vietnamese community<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
