She was then attacked by four teenagers. \nBoth Lu and the student went to Central High School. Lu is an 18-year-old high school senior. \nAuthorities believe that the attack may have been racially motivated. They say the attackers can be heard using racial slurs in the video. \nHundreds of Philadelphians marched toward the City Hall on Tuesday afternoon, WHYY reports. They were chanting \"stop bullies\" and \"stop Asian hate.\" \nLu spoke outside the Municipal Services Building in Center City Tuesday afternoon. \n\"Our message is loud and clear,\" Lu said, according to WHYY. \"We must all come together regardless of race, religion, or socio-economic classes, because we all want the same for our community: public safety in the City of Brotherly Love.\" \nMany called on SEPTA to do more to prevent violent attacks. They also asked schools to address bullying. \nAlix Webb, a lead organizer for Asian Americans United in Philadelphia, told WHYY that the group does not believe the solution is an increased police presence. \n\"We don't want solutions that are delivered at the expense of others, and that are a tool of white supremacy that perpetuate a cycle of violence and racial injustice,\" \nWebb said. \nAAU is calling for restorative justice solutions like mental health resources, counselors, bilingual services, and curriculum changes that include a focus on ethnic and cultural studies. \nLu told CBS Philadelphia that she hopes there is a path forward for her attackers. \n\"I hope that they learn from this incident, and to be a better person,\" Lu said. \"Because I know that they're just kids and they have a great future ahead.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTINE LU<|>PERSON<|>Christine Lu is an 18-year-old high school senior who was attacked while trying to help a bullied student on a SEPTA train in Philadelphia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROAD STREET LINE<|>GEO<|>The Broad Street Line is a subway line in Philadelphia where the attack on Christine Lu occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL<|>GEO<|>Central High School is the school that both Christine Lu and the bullied student attend.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHILADELPHIA<|>GEO<|>Philadelphia is the city where the attack took place and where the community is advocating against bullying and racial hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS UNITED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asian Americans United is a group in Philadelphia advocating for solutions to violence and racial injustice.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY HALL<|>GEO<|>City Hall is a location in Philadelphia where hundreds of Philadelphians marched to protest against bullying and racial hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUNICIPAL SERVICES BUILDING<|>GEO<|>The Municipal Services Building is where Christine Lu spoke out about the attack and the need for community safety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOVEMBER 17<|>EVENT<|>November 17 is the date when the attack on Christine Lu occurred aboard a SEPTA train.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTINE LU<|>BROAD STREET LINE<|>Christine Lu was attacked on the Broad Street Line subway while trying to help a bullied student<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTINE LU<|>CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL<|>Christine Lu is a student at Central High School<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTINE LU<|>PHILADELPHIA<|>Christine Lu's attack has sparked community action in Philadelphia against bullying and racial hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS UNITED<|>PHILADELPHIA<|>Asian Americans United is advocating for solutions to violence and racial injustice in Philadelphia<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHILADELPHIA<|>CITY HALL<|>Hundreds of Philadelphians marched toward City Hall to protest against bullying and racial hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTINE LU<|>MUNICIPAL SERVICES BUILDING<|>Christine Lu spoke at the Municipal Services Building about her experience and the need for community safety<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOVEMBER 17<|>CHRISTINE LU<|>The attack on Christine Lu occurred on November 17<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS UNITED<|>MUNICIPAL SERVICES BUILDING<|>Asian Americans United is involved in community discussions at the Municipal Services Building regarding the attack<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
