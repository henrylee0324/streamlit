And a Korean\nAmerican journalist with MPR News described being harassed because of her race while working in rural\nMinnesota.\nIn addition, increasing numbers of Asian Americans have been physically assaulted nationwide over the past year.\nAnti-Asian hate is one of several forms of American racism that must be acknowledged and stopped.\nThe deadly March 16 shootings in Atlanta have heightened awareness of anti-Asian incidents, sparking solidarity\nprotests over the weekend. Although the shooter's motivations remain unclear as the investigation continues, six\nof his eight victims were women of Asian descent.\nOrganizations that work on behalf Minnesota's 300,000 people of Asian descent say they've experienced\ndiscrimination and racism for decades. \"Racism is not a one-time incident,\" Bo Thao-Urabe, executive director of\nthe Coalition of Asian American Leaders (CAAL), a St. Paul nonprofit, told the Star Tribune. She added that CAAL\nand other groups have been concerned that attacks on Asian Americans would increase and become more violent.\nFearing that the coronavirus outbreak would lead to a backlash, early last year the World Health Organization\nwarned about the use of terms such as \"Wuhan virus\" and \"Chinese virus.\" Former President Donald Trump\nseemed to take pleasure in disregarding that advice, and his use of those labels and others in tweets and public\ncomments sparked the response that the WHO had predicted.\nThe ramped-up hostility has been well documented. According to PoltiFact, the respected Center for the Study of\nHate and Extremism at California State University found that anti-Asian hate crimes rose from 49 incidents in 2019\nto 122 in 2020.\nThe center used public records from 16 of the largest U.S. cities to come up with those numbers. And the FBI's\nhate crime data shows that reported anti-Asian hate crimes declined in the late 1990s but started to climb more\nrecently.\nIt's important to note that experts say hate crimes are underreported. \"There are barriers to reporting,\" Jeannine\nBell, an Indiana University law professor, told PolitiFact. \"Individual victims have to feel as if they are comfortable\nenough to report, and most likely they don't.\"\nLast week, state Rep. Tou Xiong, DFL-Maplewood, who chairs the Minnesota Asian Pacific Caucus, addressed the\nLegsislature and rightly urged Minnesotans to denounce racism. \"Silence amid this growing surge [in hate] against\nfellow Asian Americans is unacceptable,\" Xiong said.\nPresident Joe Biden has directed the Justice Department to work with communities to address hate crimes\nagainst Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. And in Minnesota, officials launched a discrimination helpline (1-\n833-454-0148) after bias reports against Asian Americans grew during the pandemic.\nOn Wednesday, CAAL will host an online event to raise awareness and share strategies to combat harassment and\ncrime. It's a critical effort that all Minnesotans should support.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WOODBURY<|>GEO<|>Woodbury is a city in Minnesota where a resident of Hmong descent faced discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTIN<|>GEO<|>Austin is a city in Minnesota where an Asian American family experienced racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINNESOTA<|>GEO<|>Minnesota is a state in the U.S. that has seen an increase in anti-Asian hate incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city where deadly shootings occurred, heightening awareness of anti-Asian incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BO THAO-URABE<|>PERSON<|>Bo Thao-Urabe is the executive director of the Coalition of Asian American Leaders in St. Paul.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COALITION OF ASIAN AMERICAN LEADERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Coalition of Asian American Leaders (CAAL) is a nonprofit organization in St. Paul advocating for Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization (WHO) is a global health authority that warned against using racially charged terms related to the coronavirus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States who used racially charged terms regarding the coronavirus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Justice Department is a U.S. government agency directed by President Joe Biden to address hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOU XIONG<|>PERSON<|>Tou Xiong is a state representative in Minnesota who chairs the Minnesota Asian Pacific Caucus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAAL EVENT<|>EVENT<|>An online event hosted by CAAL to raise awareness and share strategies to combat harassment and crime against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WOODBURY<|>MINNESOTA<|>Woodbury is a city within the state of Minnesota, which has seen an increase in anti-Asian hate incidents<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTIN<|>MINNESOTA<|>Austin is a city within the state of Minnesota, which has seen an increase in anti-Asian hate incidents<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>MINNESOTA<|>The shootings in Atlanta heightened awareness of anti-Asian incidents occurring in Minnesota<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BO THAO-URABE<|>COALITION OF ASIAN AMERICAN LEADERS<|>Bo Thao-Urabe is the executive director of CAAL, which advocates for Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>The WHO warned against racially charged terms that Donald Trump used regarding the coronavirus<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT<|>MINNESOTA<|>The Justice Department is working with communities in Minnesota to address hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOU XIONG<|>MINNESOTA<|>Tou Xiong is a state representative in Minnesota advocating against racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAAL EVENT<|>COALITION OF ASIAN AMERICAN LEADERS<|>The CAAL event is organized by the Coalition of Asian American Leaders to combat harassment<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
