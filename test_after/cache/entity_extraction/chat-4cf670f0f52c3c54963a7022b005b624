Then his wife, Angela Ren, came\nhome and said a stranger at Costco in Brandon told her to go back to China.\nIts really upsetting. Weve been in the U.S. 30 years, said Yang, 58, whose children were born and raised in Florida.\nOne starts college in the fall; the other is finishing medical school.\nAround the same time the USF students from Sparks honored the victims of the Georgia shootings by reading their\nnames aloud, Yang and his wife were attending an online vigil over Zoom with thousands of others from around\nthe country. Yang said that while socially his family connects more with other Chinese Americans, who share a\nlanguage and culture, times like this call for solidarity among Asian Americans, as well as non-Asian minorities,\nand hopefully, he said, white allies.\nHe and his wife attended their first Black Lives Matter event last year.\nI like what Martin Luther King said, that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, Yang said.\nLantz believes fear is behind the uptick in hate nationwide, stoked in part by the uncertainty of the pandemic and\nby political leaders using racist language such as China Virus and Kung Flu.\nWhen a person is more fearful, Lantz said, they tend to identify targets for their fear.\nAsian American community?\nThe fastest-growing ethnic group in Florida is Asian Americans.\nPeople of Asian descent are an estimated 4.4, 3.6 and 2.8 percent of the population in Hillsborough, Pinellas and\nPasco counties, respectively, and many suspect those numbers will be higher when the U.S. Census is released in\nApril.\nBut Tampa Bays Asian American community is better described as communities, comprised of more than a dozen\nethnicities. The largest groups across Pinellas, Pasco and Hillsborough are Indians, followed by Vietnamese,\nFilipino, Chinese and Koreans.\nThe geography of Tampa Bays Asian community is less defined and more diffuse than in many large cities, but\nthere are pockets. The Tampa Korean United Methodist Church in Wesley Chapel grew its congregation into the\nhundreds in recent years, and there are multiple Korean-language newspapers available in Tampa Bay.\nLealman and Pinellas Park have the highest percentage of residents of Vietnamese ancestry in the state.\nThe Lealman Asian Neighborhood Family Center offers services in English, Vietnamese, Hmong, Laotian and\nSpanish, and we have a friend who will come in and do Chinese if we need Chinese, said executive director Donna\nMcGill. Pretty much any services that they dont know how to access, we help them. ... Sometimes they just need to\nuse the phone, or a computer.\nThe center offers help with job applications, citizenship and an after-school literacy program for children. Three\npeople who came through the center became U.S. citizens in a recent week, McGill said.\nIn the past, our Asian families had not utilized our food pantry, McGill said, but the pandemic changed that. ... If\nyou owned a restaurant, or a nail salon, as many of our families do, its been hard.\nShes now working on making the center a vaccination site, and partnering with the nearby Holy Martyrs of Vietnam\nParish Catholic church, where for the past two years Mass has been primarily given in Vietnamese.\nLoc Nguyen, a board member at the Lealman family center, arrived in Pinellas County over 40 years ago as a\nrefugee after the Vietnam War. There was a small handful of Vietnamese, he said, but now I think we have over\n10,000 in Pinellas.\nNguyen, 66, recently helped organize the installation of a permanent monument honoring Vietnamese and\nAmericans lost in the war, which now sits at Little Saigon Plaza, a collection of Vietnamese and Korean businesses\noff U.S. 19 in Clearwater.\nSeveral dozen Filipino Americans gathered at Tampas Philippine Enrichment Complex on Sunday to dance in the\nshort film My APA Vision. The director, S. Roy Saringo, is a member of the new Florida nonprofit Asian Pacific\nAmerican Scene, Inc., formed to help cultivate Asian American Artists.\nIf you see a Filipino in Tampa Bay, you probably know them or will see them again, said Arnell Biglete, speaking of\nTampas relatively smaller Filipino community.\nHe experienced racism when he lived in bigger cities, like Los Angeles, Biglete said, but not in Tampa Bay. Today,\nhe believes, theres enough exposure to different cultures.\nBut Brandy Jones-Breth, who grew up in Tampa Bay and whos half Black and half Filipino, worried about her family\nafter the rise in hate.\nThe first thing I thought about was my mother, said Jones-Breth, 42.\nThe disconnect between popular culture recently, and whats happening in the news now, feels head spinning, said\nDebbie Crockett, director of the Asian Pacific American Bar Associations Tampa Bay chapter.\nIts really cool to be Korean right now, K-pop, K-dramas, everyone wants to eat kimchi and learn Korean and watch\nParasite, she said. Its amazing, and it makes me proud. ... Then youre bombarded with news about our elders being\npushed and shoved in the street. Its weird to me.\nA significant number of Asians are leaving large cities over safety concerns and seeking Florida sunshine, said\nRealtor Sunny Duann, who works with many such clients in Tampa. The most popular area for Chinese American\nhome buyers right now, she said, is New\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
