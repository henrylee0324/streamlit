We can resist. Take up space. Make noise,\" tweeted novelist Min Jin Lee.\n\"Instead of centering a White Supremacist who had a 'sex addiction' (which btw you can also be a racist terrorist simultaneously), remember the real victims yesterday and their families,\" Los Angeles comedian Kristina Wong said in a tweet.\nAnd Rep. Ted Lieu's tweets got angrier as the day went on.\nAt 8:27 a.m., the Torrance Democrat targeted Trump and some elected officials for creating a hostile environment with hateful anti-Asian rhetoric. \"If you are one of those officials,\" he wrote, \"please stop.\"\nAt 9:55 a.m., he scoffed at reports that \"sex addiction\" rather than racism motivated the shooting.\nTwo and a half hours later, he sounded like he'd had enough, after a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department in Cherokee County, Ga., said the gunman went on a rampage because \"yesterday was a really bad day for him.\"\n\"All of us have experienced bad days,\" Lieu tweeted. \"But we don't go to three Asian businesses and shoot up Asian employees.\"\nThe former prosecutor said in an interview that denying a racial component to the shootings \"does not comport with the facts as we know them right now.\"\n\"We've seen an increasing amount of violence toward Asian Americans, beginning with more verbal harassment,\" Lieu said. \"Then it escalated. You had an Asian American family in Texas last year that was stabbed, because the perpetrator thought they had spread the virus ... Then you saw elderly Asian Americans targeted. For many of us, it was not surprising to see multiple Asian victims of the crime.\"\nAnd then there's history, a reminder that what's past is prologue, from the 19th century \"yellow peril\" scapegoating and Chinese Exclusion Act to the incarceration of Japanese Americans by the U.S. government during World War II.\nIn 1982, a 27-year-old Chinese American man named Vincent Chin was beaten to death with a baseball bat by two unemployed Detroit autoworkers who thought he was Japanese.\nIt was a time when the U.S. auto industry was in decline. The attackers blamed Chin.\n\"When Americans feared Japan's rise in the 1980s, that caused an increase in hate crimes,\" Lieu said. \"And now, with the pandemic, you see a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans. ... When America felt threatened in the past, sometimes this country would target Asians.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
