He already faces multiple hate crime charges in a separate attack on an elderly couple at the same park, Grijalva Park in Orange, California. \n\"There was no racial slurs at the beginning,\" Kokumai said back in April. \"As he got into his car he would yell out 'Chinese' and 'Sashimi' and then I was like OK there it is.\" \nKokumai told KTLA she frequently worked out at the park in preparation for the Tokyo Olympics. \nShe said she pulled out her phone and began recording when Vivona began acting belligerently toward her. \nAccording to Fox 11, Vivona is also accused of walking up to a Korean American couple and punching them for no apparent reason. \nThe couple often comes to the park to take their daily walk. Police say others there at the time came to help the 79-year-old man and his 80-year old wife. \n`They recognized him from the previous attack on Sakura Kokumai and surrounded him, Sgt. Phil McMullin of the Orange Police Department said. \"There was an officer right there across the street and we arrested him.\" \nVivona had been living out of his car.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAKURA KOKUMAI<|>PERSON<|>Sakura Kokumai is a member of Team USA's karate team who was targeted in a hate crime incident during the Tokyo Olympics preparation.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICHAEL ORLANDO VIVONA<|>PERSON<|>Michael Orlando Vivona is a 26-year-old man arrested for multiple hate crimes, including targeting Sakura Kokumai and attacking an elderly couple.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRIJALVA PARK<|>GEO<|>Grijalva Park in Orange, California, is the location where the hate crimes against Sakura Kokumai and an elderly couple occurred.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOKYO OLYMPICS<|>EVENT<|>The Tokyo Olympics is a major international multi-sport event where Sakura Kokumai was preparing to compete.) \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Orange Police Department is the law enforcement agency that arrested Michael Orlando Vivona after the incidents at Grijalva Park.) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL ORLANDO VIVONA<|>SAKURA KOKUMAI<|>Michael Orlando Vivona is accused of committing a hate crime against Sakura Kokumai at Grijalva Park.<|>8) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL ORLANDO VIVONA<|>GRIJALVA PARK<|>Michael Orlando Vivona committed multiple hate crimes at Grijalva Park, including against Sakura Kokumai and an elderly couple.<|>7) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAKURA KOKUMAI<|>TOKYO OLYMPICS<|>Sakura Kokumai was preparing for the Tokyo Olympics when she was targeted in a hate crime incident.<|>6) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL ORLANDO VIVONA<|>ORANGE POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>Michael Orlando Vivona was arrested by the Orange Police Department following the hate crime incidents.<|>9) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL ORLANDO VIVONA<|>ELDERLY COUPLE<|>Michael Orlando Vivona is suspected of attacking an elderly couple at Grijalva Park.<|>8) \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELDERLY COUPLE<|>GRIJALVA PARK<|>The elderly couple was attacked by Michael Orlando Vivona while they were at Grijalva Park for their daily walk.<|>7) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
