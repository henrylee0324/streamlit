If we want change, we must continue to speak out because these attacks are not stopping anytime soon. We have a responsibility to not stay silent in order to educate our fellow Americans on the strength of their words and the power of their actions. If we do our part, more and more people will become aware of our situation and begin to actively learn about the ongoing virus of racism.”\nHannah, age 15\nPublic School Student, Massachusetts\n“Ever since COVID started, I had already noticed the uptick in hate crimes against Asian Americans and how they mostly went unnoticed with the news barely covering these attacks. It made me terrified to go outside for a walk or to get groceries with my family being fully aware that I could easily get caught up in one of those events. The growing news and coverage over the last year of these attacks has made me pretty self-conscious about every little thing I do. Every time I’m out somewhere public or in school, I feel like I’m being judged every step I take, and it’s agonizing. Before I went back to school, I do specifically remember talking to my mom about how I was scared that someone was going to bully me at school or say something passive-aggressive and that in the end I wouldn’t know how to react. I still feel that way. Whenever someone is whispering to someone else or staring at me in public or at school, I think the worst. I think that they’re making a snide remark about my race and it makes me anxious. In my opinion, I know it’s impossible to completely stop racism, but we can start by not blaming a single race for everything that’s going on now. It’s just not right.”\nAlexis Quan, age 18\nPublic School Student, Framingham, M.A.\n“I am aware of the anti-Asian attacks that have been going on the news more recently and when COVID-19 first struck. I do not like seeing the acts of violence and hearing of the verbal tirades someone says against the Asian community. It makes me feel disturbed that people are going out of their way to harm others simply of the color of their skin. It makes me feel unsafe. I’d rather not have to go outside and deal with someone yelling at me for ‘carrying the virus’ when I have my mask on and they do not. I am not afraid of being bullied at school. I have a good support system of friends there who I know will stand up for me. In the beginning of the pandemic, I was afraid that some people would do the classic ‘Go back to China!’ — despite the fact I have never left this continent — and make racist comments about me. Now, when I am out in public, I am just wary of others. If someone looks tense or they keep staring at me, I leave and walk away. I do not want to anger them and drive them to violence. To stop the spread of Asian hate, I would stop or prevent news outlets/sources, as well as people with political power, from saying degrading and derogatory language against Asian Americans. I feel that ex-President Donald Trump made situations worse by pinning the blame on China for not being able to contain the virus. He called it the ‘Chinese Virus,’ furthering his followers’ dislike against China. It seems that some people took this response as an ‘OK’ to use hate speech and even commit hate crimes. I would tell people to check their news sources. Is what they are getting actually verified and reliable information? To lessen people’s fears, don’t give into the hate. Just because someone is of Chinese or Asian descent, does not mean they automatically have the virus; that is not how this virus works. Do not be afraid as long as you are wearing a mask and are performing safe behaviors when outside. I would also tell people and educate them using social media posts. Teens are more reachable when facts are in short, colorful blurbs. They can then repost the article on their social media accounts.”\nBenjamin C., age 16\nPublic School Student, Chicago Suburb\n“I am aware of the anti-Asian hate attacks and the incitement that is occurring in America today. The constant cycle of violence is disgusting. I am lucky to live where these attacks do not affect my daily life much, at least not to the extent of others. It has not changed going back to school in person. The attacks have definitely impacted my family, but luckily not our day to day life, and we are still able to do much of the things we used to. I’m not afraid of being bullied for being Asian, but it is definitely present. People need to change their biases and think about the situation in another’s shoes. The attacks are a result of the lack of compassion, education, misinformation, coupled with a plethora of other reasons, and we should tackle the issue head on instead of pushing it to the side.”\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
