This meant I no longer had to deal with street harassment. \nYet even then, as a young mother taking the commuter bus, I had a bus driver yell at me to shut up when I gave instructions in Chinese to an elderly Chinese couple. They didn't know which stop to get off at and had asked me to help them. All three of us sat in shocked silence until we reached the couple's stop and I signaled it was time for them to get off without speaking. \nIn retrospect, I wonder whether the driver assumed we were talking about her, as many people inevitably do when they don't understand another language. Or perhaps she was just racist - believing that Asian people who don't speak English don't deserve any respect. When the couple got off the bus, they said thank you to me AND the bus driver, and they even waved kindly at her. I was fuming, yet I did nothing. I didn't even bother reporting her rude behavior to the Transit Agency. I figured it wouldn't do anything and she would continue to snap at anyone who spoke in a language other than English around her. \nToday, in 2021, I'm a middle aged mom who is less worried about how to deal with racist and sexualized harassment, but who continues to worry about the influence of white supremacy on all our interactions. While most of the incidents I experienced earlier in my life involved white men, there were also BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of color) men and women who initiated aggressive encounters. \nI also fully acknowledge that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are just as susceptible to charges of racism, too, especially newer immigrants who don't question the anti-Black racism prevalent in so much of American culture. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders don't always recognize how our struggles mirror those in other communities and that our privilege and yearning for \"a better life\" is often tied to the oppression of another community. White supremacy has brainwashed all of us and continues to impact our lives as Americans. \nI think of how little has changed and I worry for young people, especially my own two daughters. I worry about the racist and sexualized harassment they will endure once we emerge from this pandemic and they leave our home. The one consolation I have is that they have better answers for anyone who questions their credentials as Americans. My husband is a fifth- generation American of Chinese descent. His great-great grandparents were among the Chinese who immigrated to Honolulu and San Francisco more than 100 years ago. \nI can't wait until someone tries to ask my daughters where they are REALLY from and then try to ask about their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. Yet I also know that our faces mark us as perpetual foreigners in America, no matter how many generations of our family have lived here. \nSome of what I've shared here will resonate with my Latinx brothers and sisters. Yet I recognize my experiences and concerns pale in comparison to my friends who worry about police and other armed individuals violently threatening their sons and daughters. I think this is why I, as an American of Asian descent, never felt like I could speak up about these relatively minor incidents knowing other BIPOC communities have had devastating stories of racism that led to much deeper and long-lasting pain. \nEach individual incident I've recounted is like a small cut not enough to sever an artery but enough to cause some pain and make us fear what might come next. \nI know Asian American and Pacific Islanders are often portrayed as highly successful professionals because we are over- represented in many elite spheres. That is also a result of a skewed immigration system that severely restricted immigration from Asia until 1965, when then opened the doors to highly educated immigrants. The preferential treatment meant that top scientists, engineers, medical professionals, and other highly educated folks were over-represented in the immigrant communities from the Asia Pacific region. \nYet there have been Filipino, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, and other immigrants from Asia since before the U.S. was a nation. Our history in the U.S. is also seeped in the blood of victims of violence - Chinatowns were burned and Chinese men lynched during the Gold Rush days, Vincent Chin was murdered in 1982 because out-of-work auto workers thought he was Japanese, and Balbir Singh Sodhi was killed days after 9/11 because his attacker thought he was Muslim. \nAnti-Asian sentiment has also been enshrined in the law for a significant part of our nation's history, from the Chinese Exclusion Act (the only American law to exclude immigrants from a specific racial background), to the government-ordered incarceration of Japanese Americans during WWII (a majority of whom were American citizens!). \nFew Americans know this history, though. Moreover, the recent economic success of some Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders has overshadowed many of the struggles that lay the groundwork for current achievements. So the verbal abuse against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders isn't contextualized and is often quickly dismissed by even Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders themselves. We cannot let our ignorance of the history of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the U.S. shield us from the racism that has hounded generations. \nDismissing the behavior because the offenders didn't cause physical harm means we don't acknowledge that there is still cumulative pain. Moreover, as we have all learned recently after the murders of six Asian American women who worked at the spas in Atlanta (as well as the murder of a white female customer and white male employee), strangers targeting Asian Americans can absolutely lead to horrific violence. (Editor note: Anna wrote this story prior to the shooting deaths of eight workers at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, including four Sikhs). I think the behavior escalates when perpetrators get away \nwith the \"low-level hate.\" So I speak up today because I think we must critically examine the racist and sexualized verbal abuse many BIPOC women\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
