There has been a spike of racist attacks against Asian Americans since last spring. According to the national coalition Stop Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Hate, hate crimes \nreduced by 7% in America's 16 largest cities during the past year, but such crimes targeting Asian Americans rose by nearly 150%. Former President Donald Trump's racist rhetoric toward Asians concerning the coronavirus has fueled the most recent wave of attacks on Asian Americans. \nThis recent tragic event is not the first time in American history that Asians have been aggressively and discriminatorily targeted. Notorious historical and contemporary events include the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Japanese internment camps in the 1940s, the murder of Vincent Chin in Detroit in 198, and the violence against South Asians after the terrorist attacks in September 2001, to name a few. Asian Americans are stereotyped as \"model minorities.\" This causes disproportionate stress, pressure and adverse mental health outcomes while simultaneously making AAPIs more vulnerable to discrimination and violence and potentially elevating racial tensions among minority groups. \nRacially-biased violence is toxic for the foundations of society, posting serious threats to social stability, civic engagement, and development. Brutal attacks on Asian Americans are assaults on all Americans. Unprovoked attacks of Asian Americans, particularly on the elderly and women, are cowardly and illegal acts. We cannot remain silent about violence, turn our back on discrimination, or feel that \"racism does not exist\" or say \"it is not my problem\" or say racism is \"no longer a problem in America.\" More fundamentally, we have to stop viewing and treating Asian Americans as forever foreigners. Asian Americans have contributed to this nation for more than 150 years. Like other racial and ethnic minority groups, they are an invaluable part of our society. \nAs university professors, we have a unique role in facilitating conversations about race and communities in our pedagogy, our research and our service work. We have an obligation to integrate critical conversations on stereotypes and discrimination as part of class curricula. Students need to be able to identify racism in media, news and their own communities so they can become engaged in building collaborative communities and stand firmly against hate crimes. It is important to note that college students are susceptible to being recruited by hate groups. However, students can also become agents for positive social change, justice, and community equity. \nOur work should also be rooted in local efforts to support inclusion and education. Recently, Red Clay Schools indicated that they planned to end the Chinese immersion program at Linden Hill Elementary in Wilmington. Ending programs such as this directly harms efforts to foster a cultural diversity and to engage young children in important language skills. Immersion programs should be prioritized for renewed funding and recruitment because our country is at a critical moment in history. This moment should be seized to stand against hate and to become more diverse and equitable communities. \nWe have been fighting the pandemic for over a year, with more than a half-million Americans sadly falling. We must not allow racist violence to take hold and divide our society by causing more racial conflicts and civil disturbances during these difficult times. It is the right time to show our community solidarity and zero-tolerance for hate toward any racial and ethnic group. We call for your support to Asian Americans and communities, condemning racially-based violence and rendering your assistance to those in need. Healthy and strong Asian-American communities undoubtedly benefit the entirety of American society. \nIvan Y. Sun is professor of Sociology and Criminal Justice and Sarah E.
