Her eighth-grade son attends the school, and she has a fourth-grader enrolled at a Fairfax elementary school. Both children are biracial, she said. \nShe was aware of the wave of anti-Asian hate but never expected it to hit this close to home. \n\"I am 47 years old. I was born here in this country, grew up [here], and I have to say, for the first time in my life, I am genuinely scared,\" Gordon said. \nGordon said she is now planning to have \"tough conversations about race\" with her children. She will do her best to explain why racist attacks happen and how they should respond. She wants to urge her kids to \"always speak up\" for their rights, but she is afraid that advice might get them hurt. \nShe has not told her daughter, her youngest child, about the Longfellow incident because she does not want to scare the girl. But she did tell her son, the eighth-grader. She stuck close to the facts, speaking as neutrally as possible. \n\"Okay,\" he said, and went back to watching a video.\nBut \"I could tell in his eyes that it was a little painful for him,\" Gordon said.\nShe hoped he was actually okay.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
