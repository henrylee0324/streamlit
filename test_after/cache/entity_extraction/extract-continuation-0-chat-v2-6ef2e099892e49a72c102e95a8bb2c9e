The group did not collect data in previous years to show whether attacks against Asians have increased during the pandemic.\nAbout 68% of the anti-Asian incidents documented in the study were verbal harassment, 21% were shunning and 11% were physical assaults.\nAbout 9% of the incidents were civil rights violations such as workplace discrimination or being refused service at a business. Nearly 7% were online harassment.\nMost of the incidents occurred at businesses or on public streets.\nMore than two-thirds of the attacks in the study were reported by women.\nMore than 40% were reported by Chinese Americans, 15% by Korean Americans and 8% by Filipino Americans.\n\"We ask policymakers at the local, state and national level to partner with us on implementing community-based solutions that will help ensure Asian Americans have equal rights and access to opportunities,\" said Manjusha Kulkarni, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.\nThe report includes descriptions of the incidents provided by victims.\nAt a subway station in Annandale, Va., an Asian American woman was on an escalator when a man repeatedly punched her in the back and followed her, fake-coughing and shouting \"Chinese b--.\"\nIn August, Hong Lee was waiting for tacos at a restaurant in the Pico-Union area when a stranger approached her, handed her his business card and asked her to lunch.\nShe said she was married and declined.\nThen, she said in an interview with The Times, \"the man started screaming at me, telling me to go back to Asia, followed by two minutes of calling me every single derogatory word you could imagine.\"\nLee, a Vietnamese American nonprofit worker in her mid-30s, remembered feeling cornered by the man and \"asking for help, but no one stepped up.\"\nFinally, an employee asked the man to move to the other side of the room. He collected his food and walked out, Lee said.\nA police officer refused to take an incident report because \"he said, 'This happens all the time and there's nothing I can do,' \" she recalled. \"He said there's no crime here.\"\nLee, a mother of two, talked with her Korean American husband about whether to publicize what happened to her. She decided to encourage others \"not to take this quietly.\"\nHer video of the incident, which she posted on Instagram and Facebook, went viral. She now volunteers as an ambassador for Los Angeles County's \"L.A. vs. Hate\" campaign, connecting victims to social services and mental health resources.\nShe also reported the incident to Stop AAPI Hate.\n\"It's in our culture just to keep our heads down, and we don't want to talk about things that humiliate us,\" she said. \"But why do we need to be passive?\"\nAttacks against senior citizens in the Bay Area and New York City have intensified the outcry against anti-Asian hate crimes, though it is unclear whether many of those incidents were racially motivated.\n\"We need to reckon with both the historical and ongoing impact that racism, hate and violence are having on our community, especially on women, youth and seniors, who are particularly vulnerable,\" said Cynthia Choi, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.\nChoi and others appealed to the public to report hate attacks.\nRussell Jeung, a Stop AAPI Hate co-founder and professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, referred to former President Trump's use of the terms \"kung flu\" and \"China virus.\"\nHatred against Asian Americans should not \"be a legacy of COVID-19 or the last presidential administration,\" Jeung said.\nAbout 4 in 10 Asian Americans said people have acted uncomfortable around them because of their race since the pandemic started, and 31% said they have been subjected to racial slurs or jokes, according to a Pew Research Center study.\nIn Los Angeles, hate crimes against Asians and Pacific Islanders surged in 2020.\nAdvocates and law enforcement officials say many more incidents occur than are reported.\nAfter Lee publicized her case, five other women came forward describing a similar attacker, who is now under investigation.\n\"There's no sense in staying silent,\" Lee said. \"No one should stay fearful.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a group formed
