XINHUA/VNA Photo NEW YORK The Vietnamese Embassy in the US has repeatedly contacted with and canvassed authorities and parliaments of the US and its states to ensure security and safety as well as the right to access full services for Vietnamese citizens and Vietnamese Americans in the US, given increasing discrimination against the Asian American community in the country. \nDiscussing with representatives from the White House National Security Council (NSC), the Department of State and parliament committees, the Vietnamese side expressed concern over discrimination and even violence suffered by Vietnamese citizens in the US and Vietnamese Americans related to the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Vietnamese representative office in the US has always emphasised active contributions of the Vietnamese Americans and overseas Vietnamese community in the US to the host country, especially to the front lines of the COVID-19 fight to ensure health, security and social welfare for people across the US. \nOn March 31, Vietnamese Ambassador Hà Kim Ngc and ambassadors of other ASEAN countries to the US sent a letter to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and the NSC condemning discrimination targeting Asian Americans. They also asked local authorities to continue carrying out measures to address the issue, including ensuring security and the right to access healthcare, education, employment and other social welfare services for them. \nAmbassador Ngc also sent letters to US members of Congress, including Senator Patrick Leahy, President pro tempore of the Senate; Congressman Ami Bera, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia, and Nonproliferation; and Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy, the first Vietnamese American woman elected to Congress, to require them to raise their voice to end racial discrimination against Vietnamese citizens and Vietnamese Americans in the US. The NSC and the Department of State acknowledged ideas of the representative offices of Vit Nam and other ASEAN countries in Washington DC, pledging to maintain support to ensure interests of the Asian American community in the US. \nThe Vietnamese embassy has frequently maintained information channels and provided around-the-clock support for people in need. For support, people are advised to call hotlines of the Vietnamese Embassy in the US, Vit Nam's Consulates General in Houston, San Francisco and New York, and the Citizen Protection Call Centre of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's Consular Department. \nEarlier, US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris strongly condemned the hate and violence against Asian Americans, and committed to putting an end to the issue. Senator Patrick Leahy and Congressman Ami Bera also tweeted to protest the discrimination. \nMeanwhile, Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy ran an article in the Washington Post, criticising discrimination against Asian Americans and showing support for the Biden administration to intensify measures to protect them. -- VNS\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VIETNAMESE EMBASSY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Vietnamese Embassy in the US advocates for the rights and safety of Vietnamese citizens and Vietnamese Americans, addressing discrimination and violence against them.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HA KIM NGOC<|>PERSON<|>Hà Kim Ngoc is the Vietnamese Ambassador to the US, involved in discussions regarding the rights of Vietnamese citizens and Vietnamese Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US<|>GEO<|>The United States, where the Vietnamese Embassy operates and where discrimination against Asian Americans has been reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased discrimination against Asian Americans, including Vietnamese citizens.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTHONY BLINKEN<|>PERSON<|>Anthony Blinken is the US Secretary of State who received a letter from the Vietnamese Ambassador regarding discrimination against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATRICK LEAHY<|>PERSON<|>Patrick Leahy is a US Senator who was contacted by the Vietnamese Ambassador to address racial discrimination against Vietnamese citizens.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMI BERA<|>PERSON<|>Ami Bera is a Congressman and Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee who was involved in discussions about discrimination against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEPHANIE MURPHY<|>PERSON<|>Stephanie Murphy is a Congresswoman and the first Vietnamese American woman elected to Congress, advocating against discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Security Council (NSC) is involved in discussions with the Vietnamese Embassy regarding the safety of Vietnamese Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF STATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Department of State is involved in discussions with the Vietnamese Embassy about discrimination against Vietnamese citizens and Vietnamese Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HA KIM NGOC<|>VIETNAMESE EMBASSY<|>Hà Kim Ngoc represents the Vietnamese Embassy in discussions about the rights of Vietnamese citizens and Vietnamese Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIETNAMESE EMBASSY<|>US<|>The Vietnamese Embassy operates in the US and addresses issues of discrimination against Vietnamese citizens and Vietnamese Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HA KIM NGOC<|>ANTHONY BLINKEN<|>Hà Kim Ngoc sent a letter to Anthony Blinken regarding discrimination against Asian Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HA KIM NGOC<|>PATRICK LEAHY<|>Hà Kim Ngoc contacted Patrick Leahy to address racial discrimination against Vietnamese citizens<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HA KIM NGOC<|>AMI BERA<|>Hà Kim Ngoc reached out to Ami Bera regarding discrimination against Vietnamese Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HA KIM NGOC<|>STEPHANIE MURPHY<|>Hà Kim Ngoc contacted Stephanie Murphy to discuss issues of discrimination against Vietnamese Americans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIETNAMESE EMBASSY<|>NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL<|>The Vietnamese Embassy has discussions with the NSC regarding the safety of Vietnamese Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIETNAMESE EMBASSY<|>DEPARTMENT OF STATE<|>The Vietnamese Embassy collaborates with the Department of State on issues affecting Vietnamese citizens in the US<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>US<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased discrimination against Asian Americans in the US<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATRICK LEAHY<|>US<|>Patrick Leahy is a US Senator involved in addressing discrimination against Asian Americans<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMI BERA<|>US<|>Ami Bera is a Congressman addressing discrimination against Asian Americans in the US<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEPHANIE MURPHY<|>US<|>Stephanie Murphy is a Congresswoman advocating against discrimination in the US<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HA KIM NGOC<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Hà Kim Ngoc expressed concerns about discrimination related to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
