The Orange County Board of Supervisors in March unanimously passed two resolutions denouncing hate crimes and committing to taking action. Huntington Beach took a similar step in April. \nThe Los Angeles Human Relations Commission in 2019 launched the L.A. vs. Hate campaign to address issues in the county. Campaign leader Terri Villa-McDowell said Tuesday that victims can report hate crimes and hate incidents without going though law enforcement by dialing 211 or filling out a form online. Reports can be made anonymously and are accessible in 140 languages. \nThe state is considering legislation that would establish a Commission on the State of Hate, which would provide more resources to various agencies and the public, require a minimum of four community forums each year and require comprehensive accounting of hate crimes statewide, among other goals. \nCalifornia Assemblyman Richard Bloom, who authored the legislation, Assembly Bill 1126, said he was driven by \"frustration with increased hate locally and around the world.\" \n\"We can't eradicate hate, but we can name it and aim to understand how and why feelings of dislike snowball into full-blown hateful conduct and hate crimes,\" Bloom said in an email. \nIf the bill becomes law, the commission will be the first of its kind in the nation, he said. \nLevin noted that if the study's first-quarter findings are any indication for the rest of the year, there is much work to be done. \n\"This is one quarter of one year with only 16 jurisdictions,\" he said. \"It's horrifying.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a state in the United States where various initiatives are being taken to address hate crimes and violence against Asian communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Orange County Board of Supervisors is a governing body that passed resolutions to denounce hate crimes and take action against them.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUNTINGTON BEACH<|>GEO<|>Huntington Beach is a city in California that has taken steps to address hate crimes by passing resolutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Los Angeles Human Relations Commission launched the L.A. vs. Hate campaign in 2019 to combat hate crimes in Los Angeles County.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TERRI VILLA-MCDOWELL<|>PERSON<|>Terri Villa-McDowell is the campaign leader of the L.A. vs. Hate initiative, which helps victims report hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHARD BLOOM<|>PERSON<|>Richard Bloom is a California Assemblyman who authored Assembly Bill 1126 aimed at establishing a Commission on the State of Hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSEMBLY BILL 1126<|>EVENT<|>Assembly Bill 1126 is proposed legislation in California that seeks to create a Commission on the State of Hate to address hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS<|>CALIFORNIA<|>The Orange County Board of Supervisors operates within California and has taken action to address hate crimes in the state<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUNTINGTON BEACH<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Huntington Beach is a city in California that has passed resolutions to combat hate crimes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION<|>CALIFORNIA<|>The Los Angeles Human Relations Commission is an organization in California focused on addressing hate crimes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TERRI VILLA-MCDOWELL<|>LOS ANGELES HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION<|>Terri Villa-McDowell is the campaign leader of the L.A. vs. Hate initiative under the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICHARD BLOOM<|>ASSEMBLY BILL 1126<|>Richard Bloom authored Assembly Bill 1126, which aims to create a Commission on the State of Hate<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>ASSEMBLY BILL 1126<|>Assembly Bill 1126 is proposed legislation that pertains to the state of California and its efforts to combat hate<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
