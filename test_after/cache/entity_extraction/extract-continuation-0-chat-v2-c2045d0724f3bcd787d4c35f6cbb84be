Many members soon began posting caricatures of Asians with exaggerated facial features, memes of Asian people eating dog meat and images of U.S. soldiers inflicting violence during the Vietnam War.\nThis week, after a gunman killed eight people — including six women of Asian descent — at massage parlors in and near Atlanta, the Telegram channel linked to a poll that asked, “Appalled by the recent attacks on Asians?” The top answer, with 84% of the vote, was that the violence was “justified retaliation for COVID.”\nThe Telegram group was a sign of how anti-Asian sentiment has flared up in corners of the internet, amplifying racist and xenophobic tropes just as attacks against Asian Americans have surged. On messaging apps like Telegram and on internet forums like 4chan, anti-Asian groups and discussion threads have been increasingly active since November, especially on far-right message boards such as The Donald, researchers said.\nThe activity follows a rise in anti-Asian misinformation last spring after the coronavirus, which first emerged in China, began spreading around the world. On Facebook and Twitter, people blamed the pandemic on China, with users posting hashtags such as #gobacktochina and #makethecommiechinesepay. Those hashtags spiked when former President Donald Trump last year called COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” and “Kung Flu.”\nWhile some of the online activity tailed off before the November election, its reemergence has helped lay the groundwork for real-world actions, researchers said. The fatal shootings in Atlanta this week, which have led to an outcry over treatment of Asian Americans even as the suspect said he was trying to cure a “sexual addiction,” were preceded by a swell of racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans in places like New York and the San Francisco Bay Area, according to the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate.\n“Surges in anti-Asian rhetoric online means increased risk of real-world events targeting that group of people,” said Alex Goldenberg, an analyst at the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University, which tracks misinformation and extremism online.\nNegative Asian American tropes have long existed online but began increasing last March as parts of the United States went into lockdown over the coronavirus. That month, politicians including Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., used the terms “Wuhan virus” and “Chinese coronavirus” to refer to COVID-19 in their tweets.\nThose terms then began trending online, according to a study from the University of California, Berkeley. On the day Gosar posted his tweet, usage of the term “Chinese virus” jumped 650% on Twitter; a day later there was an 800% increase in their usage in conservative news articles, the study found.\nTrump also posted eight times on Twitter last March about the “Chinese virus,” causing vitriolic reactions. In the replies section of one of his posts, a Trump supporter responded, “U caused the virus,” directing the comment to an Asian Twitter user who had cited U.S. death statistics for COVID-19. The Trump fan added a slur about Asian people.\nRepresentatives for Trump, McCarthy and Gosar did not respond to requests for comment.\nMisinformation linking the coronavirus to anti-Asian beliefs also rose last year. Since last March, there have been nearly 8 million mentions of anti-Asian speech online, much of it falsehoods, according to Zignal Labs, a media insights firm.\nIn one example, a Fox News article from April that went viral baselessly said that the coronavirus was created in a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan and intentionally released. The article was liked and shared more than 1 million times on Facebook and retweeted 78,800 times on Twitter, according to data from Zignal and CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned tool for analyzing social media.\nBy the middle of last year, the misinformation had started subsiding as election-related commentary increased. The anti-Asian sentiment ended up migrating to platforms like 4chan and Telegram, researchers said.\nBut it still occasionally flared up, such as when Dr. Li-Meng Yan, a researcher from Hong Kong, made unproven assertions last fall that the coronavirus was a bioweapon engineered by China. In the United States, Yan became a right-wing media sensation. Her appearance on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show in September has racked up at least 8.8 million views online.\nAfter the shootings in Atlanta, a doctored screenshot of what looked like a Facebook post from the suspect circulated on Facebook and Twitter this week. The post featured a miasma of conspiracies about China engaging in a COVID-19 cover-up and wild theories about how it was planning to “secure global domination for the 21st century.”\nFacebook and Twitter eventually ruled that the screenshot was fake and blocked it. But by then, the post had been shared and liked hundreds of times on Twitter and more than 4,000 times on Facebook.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TELEGRAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Telegram is a messaging app where a new group promoting anti-Asian sentiment was formed, allowing users to share racist content and memes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the city where a gunman killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at massage parlors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an advocacy group that tracks and responds to incidents of anti-Asian hate and violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States who referred to COVID-19 using terms that fueled anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL GOSAR<|>PERSON<|>Paul Gosar is a Republican Representative who used the term \"Wuhan virus\" in tweets, contributing to anti-Asian rhetoric.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEVIN MCCARTHY<|>PERSON<|>Kevin McCarthy is a Republican Representative who referred to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese coronavirus\" in his tweets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LI-MENG YAN<|>PERSON<|>Li-Meng Yan is a researcher from Hong Kong who made unproven claims that the coronavirus was a bioweapon engineered by China.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged, which has been linked to anti-Asian sentiment in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>4CHAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>4chan is an internet forum where anti-Asian groups and discussions have been increasingly active, especially among far-right users.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is the pandemic that began in Wuhan, leading to increased anti-Asian sentiment and violence in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TELEGRAM<|>ATLANTA<|>The Telegram group was linked to discussions about the violent attacks in Atlanta against Asian individuals<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ATLANTA<|>Stop AAPI Hate tracks incidents of violence against Asian Americans, including the shootings in Atlanta<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>COVID-19<|>Donald Trump's use of terms like \"Chinese virus\" contributed to the rise of anti-Asian sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL GOSAR<|>COVID-19<|>Paul Gosar's tweets referring to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\" fueled anti-Asian rhetoric<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEVIN MCCARTHY<|>COVID-19<|>Kevin McCarthy's reference to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese coronavirus\" contributed to anti-Asian sentiment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LI-MENG YAN<|>COVID-19<|>Li-Meng Yan's claims about COVID-19 being a bioweapon contributed to anti-Asian beliefs<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WUHAN<|>COVID-19<|>Wuhan is the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been linked to increased anti-Asian sentiment<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>4CHAN<|>TELEGRAM<|>Both 4chan and Telegram have been platforms for the spread of anti-Asian sentiment and misinformation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>TELEGRAM<|>Stop AAPI Hate monitors the rise of anti-Asian sentiment, which has been amplified on platforms like Telegram<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
