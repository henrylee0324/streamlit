Data shows a surge in online harassment and racist posts targeting Asians following a prevalence of racially insensitive hashtags on social media. \nIn an era of globalized information explosion, social networking platforms have become a tool for many opportunists, who in order to gain profit, publish sensationalist statements and disinformation that attract attention and influence public opinion to portray a negative image of particular groups of people, which ultimately has serious social consequences. \nBenjamin H. Nam, a Korean American scholar in international and comparative education who also conducted research on racial trauma amid the COVID-19 pandemic, found that since the early days of the pandemic - between February and April 2020 - YouTube has \"portrayed countless accounts of racial discrimination toward Asians, Asian Americans, and international Asian students,\" while discriminative contents surged \"especially during the presidential election campaign period,\" Nam told the Global Times. \nSome opinion leaders, especially the influential US politicians who constantly make racist remarks on their personal accounts with tens of thousands of followers, have largely fueled the spread of hate against Asians on social media, observers found. \n\"I clearly remember a white American man tweeted in February that he planned to shoot Chinese-Americans indiscriminately in Brooklyn's Chinatown because 'the Chinese had brought the virus to the US',\" Tang Enyang, 46, who has been naturalized in the US for 20 years and a New York resident told the Global Times. \nTang also added that although this incident ended with the New York City Police Department deploying extra police patrols on local streets, in the comments section of the tweet, there was a 50-50 split between condemnation and fanaticism, with indifference seeming to slightly overwhelm concem. \nIn the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, attacks against Asians, especially those of Chinese descent, on social networking platforms have made Asian Americans feel isolated and grossly misunderstood. \n39-year-old Muong (pseudonym) from Vietnam, who has been living in the US since the age 13 and took on American citizenship at the age of 19, believes there was an obvious surge in discriminative posts on social media in the beginning when the former president Donald Trump dubbed COVID-19 as the \"China virus.\" \nShe thinks Trump's comments and negative nomenclature affected people's projection of China and Asia. \"That was very annoying and stupid,\" Muong told the Global Times on Tuesday. \nTang also noted that the growing discrimination against Asians in the US has been significantly linked to the fact that Trump and his subordinates have deliberately referred to the novel coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus\" in several important public appearances. \n\"Many white Americans seem to have found an outlet for their unbridled anger against Asians, and there are many extreme-minded opinion leaders who have gone to great lengths to reinforce this message, leading to countless people taking to Twitter to 'declare war' on the Asians,\" she said. \nA report released by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a civil rights group, examined Twitter activity surrounding Trump's declaration on October 2, 2020. Researchers found an 85 percent increase in anti-Asian rhetoric and conspiracy theories on the platform in the 12 hours following the announcement, many blaming China, the US media NBC reported. \nTang noted that whether on Facebook or Twitter, the only things that inspire compassion for Asians from the majority of Americans are extremely violent incidents, such as attacks that result in bloodshed or the loss of life of people of Chinese descent, with hard evidence on video or audio, but otherwise, verbal attacks that make the said group of people feel uncomfortable were largely unnoticed. \n\"But there are so many voices conveying racist messages. Twitter and Facebook occasionally blocked or flagged these messages, but for the most part turned a blind eye, and as to whether or not to ban and punish these foul-mouthed people, no one but Asians are concerned,\" Tang said. \nSocial media's response to identify remarks within the racist category follows inconsistent and unclear matrices. Though almost all platforms have rules against racist posts or the use of sensitive terms, the line was still not clear, or they sometimes flip-flopped about the red lines. While TikTok has banned \"Kung Flu\" in their platforms, posts containing the word can still be found on Facebook and Youtube. \nThe platforms sometimes also found it difficult or hesitated in balancing controlling hate speech and protecting freedom of expression, especially when facing pressure from political figures accusing the platforms of censorship. \nAccording to the Morning Consult poll, a 43 percent plurality say social media companies are doing a \"poor\" job of preventing the spread of hate speech and violent content targeting Asian people on their respective platforms \nMuong agrees that social media platforms did do a poor job. She doesn't find social media platforms punish the accounts that spread hateful information against Asians. \n\"During the presidential election, they did close Trump's social media account. I am not aware if they closed any of the Asian haters' accounts,\" she said. \n\"Because it is very politically related and I don't think the profit-driven tech companies have the drive or motivation to close the accounts,\" she stressed. \nHatred never gone\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
