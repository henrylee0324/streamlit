So they continue, showing no signs of\nabating.\nBefore the coronavirus pandemic, this was not a big problem. Hate crimes against Asians were relatively few\nand far between. But a huge upswing began just about the time ex-President Donald Trump dubbed the\ncoronavirus plague the \"Chinese virus,\".\nAround California, these crimes have far more than doubled over the last year, but no one can put a precise\nnumber on them. In San Francisco, they have at least tripled. In Los Angeles, there have been more than twice\nas many this year as a year ago. But official numbers are likely far lower than in real life, partly because police don't do much about the attacks.\nNot even 700-person rallies decrying the attacks, like one the other day in San Jose, can stop them.\nThe head of a Southern California group called Asian-Americans Advancing Justice told one reporter many such\ncrimes go unreported because of language problems, immigrants unable to communicate with police. Plus, she\nsaid, \"When victims...come forward, having the police say nothing can be done discourages other victims from\nrelying on police.\"\nSome immigrant advocates also say Korean-Americans and other Asian groups are perceiving new bias among\npolice officers, perhaps caused by the Trump rhetoric.\nBut the mere presence of cops on street patrol could have stopped one early March assault on an elderly Asian\nman who was seated in a Nob Hill laundromat in San Francisco when at attacker ambushed him. Police presence\nprobably would have spared the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai-American beaten to death in\nbroad daylight, also in San Francisco.\nNeither of their assailants has been identified, like most others conducting the current spate of attacks.\nThere are also less violent, but still threatening incidents. One Asian-American woman stopped at a red light the\nother day in Fresno and a man in the next car signaled she should roll down her window. When she did, he\nshouted, \"Get out of my country — that's an order.\" After pausing, he reportedly added, \"I'll kill you.\"\nAll this is a demonstration that even a \"model minority\" noted for high achievement and founding large andsuccessful businesses of many types can suddenly be targeted, especially when national leaders become loose-\nlipped about their own prejudices.It also shows that not only California, but the entire nation needs effective policing to protect minorities who\nhave no way to know when they might be victimized, even if their particular ethnic group enjoys generally high\npublic esteem.\nBecause bigots have always picked on those they see as weak, this is especially important for elderly and frail\nindividuals.\nYes, the pandemic appears to have originated in or near the Chinese city of Wuhan. But there is no evidence it\nwas deliberately perpetrated on the world. The claim that it was amounts to a blood libel against Chinese\nindividuals who would have been thousands of miles away even if deeds like this had been done.\nBecause most others have difficulty discerning Asians' native nationalities simply from their appearance, all\nAsian-Americans are now at serious risk, especially if they don't look strong, a la the Los Angeles Angels' 6-foot,\n4-inch, 210 pound Shohei Otani.\nPolice are their only assured protection from random violence and bigotry when they leave their homes. And the\nfewer cops on the street, the more danger for them. Which is just one reason it makes little sense to defund\npolice, as Americans are now discovering.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a state in the United States where city councils are responding to social issues and anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black Lives Matter is a movement advocating for social justice and has influenced city councils to divert police budgets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SACRAMENTO<|>GEO<|>Sacramento is a city in California experiencing issues related to anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN JOSE<|>GEO<|>San Jose is a city in California where anti-Asian violence has been reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles is a city in California that has seen a significant increase in anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN LEANDRO<|>GEO<|>San Leandro is a city in California affected by anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Orange County is a region in California where anti-Asian violence is occurring.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States whose rhetoric has been linked to an increase in anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old Thai-American victim of a violent attack in San Francisco.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESNO<|>GEO<|>Fresno is a city in California where incidents of anti-Asian sentiment have been reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN-AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asian-Americans Advancing Justice is a group advocating for the rights and protection of Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Black Lives Matter has influenced California city councils to change police funding in response to social justice issues<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SACRAMENTO<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Sacramento is a city within California experiencing social issues related to anti-Asian violence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN JOSE<|>CALIFORNIA<|>San Jose is a city within California that is facing challenges with anti-Asian violence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Los Angeles is a city within California that has reported a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN LEANDRO<|>CALIFORNIA<|>San Leandro is a city within California affected by anti-Asian violence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORANGE COUNTY<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Orange County is a region within California experiencing anti-Asian violence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric has contributed to a rise in anti-Asian sentiment in California<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was a victim of a violent attack in San Francisco, highlighting the issue of anti-Asian violence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRESNO<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Fresno is a city within California where anti-Asian sentiment has been reported<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN-AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Asian-Americans Advancing Justice is advocating for the rights and protection of Asian-Americans in California<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
