The fact that Covid-19 was first identified in China has led some people to blame Asian-Americans, police officials have said.\nLast year, the NYPD recorded 28 hate crimes against Asians, up from three in 2019. Asians were targeted in 28 hate crimes from Jan. 1 through March 25 of this year, compared with seven such crimes in the same period last year, according to the NYPD.\nWhile the number of hate crimes counted by the NYPD is relatively small compared with other crimes, officials believe hate crimes are underreported.\n\"Like much of America we've seen a disturbing spike in hate crimes targeting Asian-Americans in New York City,\" Mr. Shea said.\nNYPD officials said the types of hate crimes committed against Asians in the city have included assaults and harassment. The officials said motives for the crimes have varied, but suspects in several instances have been people experiencing homelessness or mental-health issues.\nOther U.S. cities, such as Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif., also have seen a rise in hate crimes targeting Asians, prompting people to form volunteer patrols in some communities. A series of shootings at spas in the Atlanta area on March 16 claimed the lives of eight people, six of whom were women of Asian descent.\nThe suspect in the attacks has been charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, officials said.\nWhile according to police the suspect said he targeted the businesses \"for providing an outlet for his addiction to sex,\" Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton Jr. said on March 18 that investigators were still considering all options, including the possibility the incident was a hate crime.\nMr. Shea said Thursday that the NYPD also would expand its tools to fight hate crimes with new programs, staffing adjustments and changes to existing protocols for investigations.\nTwo detectives will be added to the NYPD's Asian Hate Crime Task force, raising the group's number of detectives to 18, police officials said.\nThe Task Force was begun amid the pandemic and is staffed by detectives of Asian descent who speak a combined nine Asian languages. The group is tasked with guiding victims through the justice system, from reporting a crime to prosecution.\nThe task force's founding supervisor, NYPD Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, said Thursday that he is retiring. Mr. Loo is being succeeded on the Task Force by NYPD Inspector Tommy Ng.\nMr. Ng joined the NYPD in 1997 and was the first commanding officer in the city to conduct community meetings in Chinese at the Fifth Precinct in Manhattan's Chinatown neighborhood.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York Police Department (NYPD) is the principal law enforcement agency in New York City, responsible for maintaining public safety and combating crime, including hate crimes targeting Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DERMOT SHEA<|>PERSON<|>Dermot Shea is the NYPD Commissioner who announced the deployment of undercover officers to combat hate crimes against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is the largest city in the United States, where a rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans has been reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian Hate Crime Task Force is a specialized unit within the NYPD, formed to address and investigate hate crimes against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEWART LOO<|>PERSON<|>Stewart Loo is the founding supervisor of the NYPD's Asian Hate Crime Task Force, who announced his retirement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMMY NG<|>PERSON<|>Tommy Ng is the NYPD Inspector succeeding Stewart Loo as the supervisor of the Asian Hate Crime Task Force.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has been linked to an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans, as some individuals have blamed them for the virus's origin.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA AREA SHOOTINGS<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta area shootings on March 16 resulted in the deaths of eight people, six of whom were women of Asian descent, raising concerns about hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DERMOT SHEA<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>Dermot Shea is the Commissioner of the New York Police Department and is responsible for its operations and announcements regarding crime prevention.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>The NYPD operates within New York City, addressing crime and public safety issues, including hate crimes against Asian-Americans.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT<|>The Asian Hate Crime Task Force is a unit within the NYPD specifically focused on investigating hate crimes against Asian-Americans.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEWART LOO<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>Stewart Loo is the founding supervisor of the Asian Hate Crime Task Force, overseeing its establishment and operations.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOMMY NG<|>ASIAN HATE CRIME TASK FORCE<|>Tommy Ng succeeded Stewart Loo as the supervisor of the Asian Hate Crime Task Force, continuing its mission to combat hate crimes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans in New York City.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA AREA SHOOTINGS<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>The Atlanta area shootings have raised awareness and concern about hate crimes against Asian-Americans, similar to those reported in New York City.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
