(Xinhua/Wang Ying)SATURDAY FURYSaturday afternoon, hundreds of people of various races and backgrounds rallied and marched in Flushing, a prosperous Asian community in Queens borough of New York City, with several speakers sharing their personal stories about racism and the participants chanting slogans for much of the time. New Yorkers have held at least 10 major rallies since the Atlanta shootings.As neighbors, friends and students, Asian Americans deserved to be treated with respect and should have safety, said Jordan Wolf, who taught at Flushing International High School.The root causes of hate against Asian Americans were the prejudice and the desire to treat other people like objects or take \"people different from you as not your own flesh and blood,\" said Ray Low, a pastor working in Manhattan.\"White supremacy is a scourge on this earth and to all people. It needs to be dismantled in order for us to live healthier, happier, more protected lives,\" said Samantha Evangelis, a second-generation immigrant living in New York.People holding signs take part in a Stop Asian Hate rally in Chinatown of Chicago, the United States, on March 27, 2021. (Photo by Vincent Johnson/Xinhua)Also Saturday afternoon, more than 1,000 people of various races gathered at Chinatown Square in the South Side of Chicago to protest against increasing crimes targeting people of Asian descents and the recent savage killing in Atlanta.People holding banners reading \"Zero tolerance for racism,\" \"Stop Asian Hate,\" \"I stand with Asian Americans,\" flocked to Chinatown Square starting noon. Local officials and district police chief, including President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners Toni Preckwinkle and Illinois State Representative Theresa Mah, joined them.By organizing the event, \"we hope to be heard,\" and to unite local residents under a common goal of building a safer and better Chinese community in cooperation with the local government and the police, Grace Chan, executive director of the Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community, which co-hosted the protest with the Chinatown Security Foundation, told Xinhua in an interview.People take part in a rally against racism and violence on Asian Americans at city hall in San Francisco, the United States, March 27, 2021. (Xinhua/Wu Xiaoling)In San Francisco Saturday afternoon, several \"StopAsianHate\" rallies were held respectively, and protesters marched from the City Hall and Chinatown, converging at Union Square.San Francisco Mayor London Breed attended the gathering at Union Square, delivering a speech to call for solidarity to fight against racism.VOICES HEARDOn Friday, U.S. social media users showed their support for the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community by participating in a virtual day of action. The campaign, organized by the advocacy group Stand With Asians, aimed to lobby corporate and political leaders to address the discrimination, inequity and violence faced by Asian Americans.Organizers said that they selected March 26 for the day of action because the date marked the anniversary of the Naturalization Act of 1790, which restricted U.S. citizenship by naturalization to white immigrants, a barrier that was not removed for all Asians until 1952.\"Today, and everyday, we stand in solidarity, in support, and in shared resolve with the Asian American community. Hate will not divide our states and our communities, and we condemn all expressions of racism, xenophobia, scapegoating, and anti-Asian sentiment,\" tweeted Delaware Governor John Carney.People participate in a Stop Asian Hate rally and march in response to the rising violence against Asian American communities at Los Angeles City Hall, California, the United States March 27, 2021. (Xinhua)As part of the response on Friday, the Asian American Journalists Association said that Asian American journalists fought to cover the recent fatal shootings at the Atlanta-area spas, but some were met with resistance and rejected when asking for nuanced coverage in newsrooms where they were often underrepresented.\"The professional challenges for AAPIs are complicated and rooted in systemic problems. The range of concerns raised by our members are deeply concerning, and we urge newsrooms to listen to, learn from, and advocate for their employees,\" the organization said in a statement.U.S. House Representative Grace Meng of New York said that she remembered the slurs and name-calling she and her fellow Asian Americans occasionally endured on the playgrounds of New York.People hold signs at a Stop Asian Hate rally in Plano, Texas, the United States, on March 27, 2021.
