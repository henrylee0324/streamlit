A 21-year-old male suspect\nwas taken into custody hours after a manhunt, police said.\nOn social media, members of the Asian American community shared personal testimonials of the blatant racism\nand microaggressions they have faced in their lifetime, precautions they have taken in the wake of recent\nattacks, and words of grief following the killings.\nWhile the motive of the suspect — a white man — has not yet been determined, many have drawn a connection\nbetween the rise in crimes against Asian Americans throughout the pandemic and the shooting deaths of the\nwomen he allegedly killed.\nThe organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice noted while there is “much to learn tonight” about the\nshootings in Georgia, many of the “victims are Asian, calling into question if this is related to recent hate crimes\nand assaults against Asian Americans.”\n“We have heavy hearts tonight as we mourn eight people who have lost their lives in a senseless act of\nviolence,” the organization wrote on Twitter.\nAn analysis released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San\nBernardino, which looked at police department statistics across the United States, revealed that the nation saw\na considerable hike in anti-Asian hate crimes last year in numerous major cities.\nThe study examined hate crimes in 16 of America's major cities, and found that while such crimes decreased by\n7 percent in 2020, those committed against Asian Americans surged by nearly 150 percent. In Boston, hate\ncrimes rose from six reported in 2019 to 14 reported in 2020, according to the analysis, equivalent to a 133\npercent rise.\nIn New York Tuesday night, NYPD Assistant Chief Martine Materasso said the department deployed Critical\nResponse Command units to Asian communities.\n“While there is no known nexus to #NYC we will be deploying assets to our great Asian communities across the\ncity out of an abundance of caution,” Materasso wrote on Twitter.\nLate Tuesday night, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp weighed in on the tragedies, expressing sympathy for those\naffected.\n“Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence,” Kemp wrote on Twitter.\nGeorgia Senator Raphael Warnock said his heart “is broken tonight after the tragic violence in Atlanta that took\neight lives.”\n“Once again we see that hate is deadly,” Warnock wrote on Twitter. “Praying for the families of the victims and\nfor peace for the community.”\nSome were quick to note the role former president Donald Trump may have played in spurring anti-Asian\nsentiments. At the beginning of the pandemic — and as recently as Tuesday evening during a televised interview\non Fox News — Trump used racist language targeting Asian Americans and the Chinese community.\nHe has referred to the coronavirus as “the China virus” and “kung flu,” racist slurs that quickly became a rallying\ncry for his supporters.\nPresident Biden acknowledged the violence committed against Asian Americans less than a week ago, saying,\n“It's wrong. It's un-American. And it must stop.”\nYet many Asian Americans shared that racism, whether overt or in the form of microaggressions, has been\npresent throughout the course of their lives. And others online said America's history and policies have long\npointed to racial injustice toward the community.\nActivist Timothy Phan wrote on Twitter that “if your automatic response to anti-Asian violence in #atlanta today\nis blame Donald Trump, you haven't done enough to process the history of anti-Asian xenophobia in this\ncountry's wretched history towards working-class immigrants of color.”\nAlton Wang, a J.D. candidate at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law, said that growing up, his\n“ever cautious dad” always chided him to be observant and alert of his surroundings — a “critical reminder now.”\n“That the shooter targeted Asian women is not a coincidence,” Wang wrote on Twitter. “The misogynistic racism\ndirected at Asian women is evident not just on platforms like Twitter, but in history — the roots of our broken,\nracist immigration system began by banning entry of Chinese women under the Page Act.”\nImani Perry, the Hughes-Rogers Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, said she\nteaches a class on race in legal history.\nThroughout the course, Perry said, she always educates her students on Asian American history “because you\ncannot teach serious history of US law as an instrument of racial injustice without the history of Asian\nAmericans.”\n“And today, the patterns of racial violence that are predicated on a notion of Asian Americans as 'not\nbelonging' are directly tied to that history,” Perry wrote on Twitter. “I deeply hope that we can understand the\ncurrent horror of racist violence directed at Asian Americans as a product of a shameful history that must be\naddressed directly.”\nNguyễn Anh Thư, of OCA–Asian Pacific American Advocates, said her mother, aunts, and herself have “been in\na steady state of tension this entire pandemic.”\n“This is beyond terrifying. Now, not only are they risking infection when going to work at the nail salon, they\nrisk deadly targeted violence,” she wrote on Twitter. “I know those aestheticians — you know them too.”\nBut, she said, “I can't trust agencies that embody white supremacy to protect my family.”\nClaire Tran, who will be joining the Washington Post as a social media editor, shared that the events in Atlanta\n— for her and many of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is a U.S. state where a series of shootings occurred, resulting in eight fatalities, many of whom were women of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the capital city of Georgia where two massage parlors were targeted in the shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asian Americans Advancing Justice is an organization that advocates for the rights of Asian Americans and commented on the shootings in Georgia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, analyzes hate crime statistics and reported a surge in anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRIAN KEMP<|>PERSON<|>Brian Kemp is the Governor of Georgia who expressed sympathy for the victims of the shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAPHAEL WARNOCK<|>PERSON<|>Raphael Warnock is a Senator from Georgia who commented on the tragic violence in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former president whose rhetoric has been linked to rising anti-Asian sentiments during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the current President of the United States who condemned the violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIMOTHY PHAN<|>PERSON<|>Timothy Phan is an activist who commented on the historical context of anti-Asian violence in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALTON WANG<|>PERSON<|>Alton Wang is a J.D. candidate who shared personal experiences related to the targeted violence against Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMANI PERRY<|>PERSON<|>Imani Perry is a professor who teaches about race in legal history and emphasizes the importance of Asian American history in understanding racial injustice.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGUYEN ANH THU<|>PERSON<|>Nguyễn Anh Thư is an advocate from OCA–Asian Pacific American Advocates who expressed concerns about the safety of her family during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE<|>GEORGIA<|>Asian Americans Advancing Justice commented on the shootings in Georgia, highlighting the victims' backgrounds<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>GEORGIA<|>The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism reported on the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes in the U.S., including Georgia<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRIAN KEMP<|>GEORGIA<|>Brian Kemp, as the Governor of Georgia, expressed sympathy for the victims of the shootings in his state<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAPHAEL WARNOCK<|>GEORGIA<|>Raphael Warnock, as a Senator from Georgia, commented on the tragic violence that occurred in Atlanta<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric has been linked to rising anti-Asian sentiments, which Asian Americans Advancing Justice addressed in their comments<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE<|>Joe Biden acknowledged the violence against Asian Americans, which aligns with the concerns raised by Asian Americans Advancing Justice<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIMOTHY PHAN<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Timothy Phan criticized the automatic blame placed on Donald Trump for anti-Asian violence, indicating a deeper historical context<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALTON WANG<|>TIMOTHY PHAN<|>Alton Wang's comments about the targeted violence against Asian women resonate with Timothy Phan's historical perspective on anti-Asian xenophobia<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMANI PERRY<|>ALTON WANG<|>Imani Perry's teachings on Asian American history relate to Alton Wang's experiences and observations about racism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NGUYEN ANH THU<|>GEORGIA<|>Nguyễn Anh Thư expressed concerns about the safety of her family in Georgia amidst the rise in violence<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
