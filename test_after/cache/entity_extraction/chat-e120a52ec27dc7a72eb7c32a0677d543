We don't want you ... infecting us with your\ndiseases!!!!!!!!!!\"\nThe note was signed, \"your friendly neighbors.\"\n\"My blood was boiling,\" recalled Moua, a 28-year-old account manager at a staffing agency who is a native-born\nAmerican of Hmong descent.\nSome Asian-Americans in the Twin Cities and across the nation are facing hostility as the U.S. becomes the country with\nthe largest number of cases of COVID-19, caused by a virus that President Donald Trump controversially dubbed the\n\"Chinese flu.\"\nIn New York, an Asian-American woman was punched in the face by a woman who denounced her heritage and\ndemanded to know where her face mask was. In California, a 16-year-old Asian-American boy was attacked by\nclassmates who accused him of carrying the virus.\nIn Minnesota, people of East Asian descent more commonly report getting rude looks or comments from other patrons in\nstores, community leaders say.\nThe Minnesota Department of Human Rights says it has started to hear about bias incidents targeting Asian-Americans.\nAnd state agencies, such as the Department of Health, are reminding people not to make assumptions about who has\nthe disease based on their ethnic background.\nPublic health experts have discouraged attaching a nationality to the virus and raised concerns that Trump's word choice\ncould increase xenophobic attacks, though Trump has said that he's being accurate, not racist. The president clarified\nthis week that it was important to \"protect our Asian-American community\" and that the spread of COVID-19 is not their\nfault.\nAs an investigator in the Attorney General's Office, Thai Heu has been tracking bias complaints from the Asian-American\ncommunity and visited Moua's home Thursday to interview him. He also interviewed a Hmong apartment manager in\nWoodbury who found a handwritten note in a box where rent payments are dropped off that read, \"Go back to your\ncountry or I kill you, Chinese!\"\nHeu said he knows many Hmong people who have been getting ammunition and weapons to protect themselves and\ntheir families.\nThe tension hit home recently for Mysee Chang, a 28-year-old resident of St. Paul, when she got a phone call from her\nHmong step-grandmother who said through tears, \"I don't feel safe, what do I do?\"\nAs shoppers clamored to get groceries to ride out the pandemic, Chang said, a man confronted her step-grandmother for\ntaking one of the last packages of chicken. Chang said the man apparently thought her grandmother was Chinese and\nsaid, \"You are the reason why this is happening, so you don't deserve this meat.\"\nA cousin who lives in the Woodbury apartment complex where the death threat was sent said she fears someone will be\nwatching when she goes out.\nChang said she has been working to relay precautions about social distancing to Hmong elders and has encouraged\nrelatives to postpone two traditional funerals that would have brought out hundreds of people. But while she feels she\nknows how to handle the public health aspect of the pandemic, she's unsure how to protect her family against racism.\n\"I no longer feel safe,\" she said.\nState Rep. Jay Xiong, DFL-St. Paul, said in a Facebook post that he rolled down his car window in a store parking lot\nrecently and realized that a man was yelling racist comments at him.\n\"Among the obscenities he hurled included calling me a [racial slur] and telling me that a disease-ridden person like\nmyself should go back to my country,\" Xiong said.\n\"I am both saddened and outraged that as a Hmong-American born and raised in St. Paul, I had to hear such racist\nnonsense,\" he wrote. \"I have heard similar stories out in [the] community, and there have been worse manifestations of\nsuch incidents, which include violence.\"\nXiong did not respond to requests for an interview.\n\"It's these types of things that we're hearing about,\" said Taylor Putz, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of\nHuman Rights. Putz noted, however, that the agency's authority extends only to discrimination in housing, employment\nand education.\n\"So if your neighbor calls and yells at you and says, 'Go back to your country with your virus because you're Asian,'\nalthough that's not a friendly thing to do at all, that's not [what] falls under the Minnesota Human Rights Act,\" he said.\nIn Woodbury, Moua's landlord reported the racist note to the police.\n\"Ninety-nine percent of the community is great -- I haven't had an issue,\" Moua said. \"It's always just that one person\nthat ruins it.\"\nMembers of the Coalition of Asian American Leaders network have reported recent bias incidents related to the virus,\nsuch as cashiers refusing to serve them, according to executive director Bo Thao-Urabe. The coalition is holding a\nwebinar April 10 to talk about dealing with xenophobia and discrimination during the pandemic. Featured speakers\ninclude Asian-American historian Erika Lee and Minnesota Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero.\nThao-Urabe said she's heard complaints, mainly from people of East Asian descent -- like the Hmong -- who are not\neven Chinese-American. Minnesota's sizable Hmong population began arriving as refugees from Laos in the 1970s.\n\"If a person is choosing to be racist, they're not thinking about asking if you're Chinese or if you're a different ethnicity,\"\nshe said.\nZhuoling Ren, founder and president of the China Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said her patients have been\nunderstanding and that the virus has not\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
