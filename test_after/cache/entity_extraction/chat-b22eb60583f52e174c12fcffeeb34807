It currently stands at $285.4 million in global receipts. \n\"The resounding success of 'Godzilla vs. Kong' represents an incredibly important and positive milestone both financially and symbolically for the movie industry,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at Comscore. \"We are seeing that as consumer confidence grows, so too does the ability of movie theatres to generate stronger box office.\" \nElsewhere at the box office this weekend, Sony Screen Gems' \"The Unholy\" opened in 1,850 locations to $3.2 million and Atlas Distribution's \"The Girl Who Believes in Mirades\" premiered in 680 locations to $580,068. \nAlthough U.S. theatres are slowly returning after a year of harried reopenings and closings, major theatres including Regal and AMC and smaller chains have not yet reopened. \nLos Angeles Times \nMonet exhibit comes to Toronto \nToronto is getting another immersive exhibition dedicated to a famous painter. \n\"Beyond Monet: The Immersive Experience\" is expected to make its world premiere at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre this summer for a limited run. \n\"People of all ages can be part of every brush stroke as Monet's artwork comes to life in front of their very eyes,\" a news release says, with music, sound effects and scenography as part of the experience within a 50,000-square-foot space. French painter Claude Monet (1840 to 1926) was a founder of the Impressionist movement. \n\"Beyond Monet\" was created by Montreal's Normal Studio and is presented by Beyond Exhibitions Inc. \nVisitors will be physically distanced with timed-entry tickets to limit capacity. \nDebra Yeo \nNike sues maker of Lil Nas X shoes \nLooks like Lil Nas X's \"Satan Shoes\" collaboration has taken a step too far. \nThe Hollywood Reporter said fulfilment of orders of the controversial sneaker has stopped after a U.S. District Court in New York approved Nike's request for a temporary restraining order against Mschf, the Brooklyn-based collective that collaborated with the singer-rapper on the shoes. \nNike sued the collective Monday, alleging trademark infringement, false designation of origin and trademark dilution. The sneakers are based on Nike's Air Max 97, but with a pentagram pendant and a drop of human blood in every sole. \nLil Nas X, who was not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit, released the sneakers as part of a promotion for his new song \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name).\" \nLos Angeles Times \nBriefly \nArden Cho says she experienced a racist attack in which a man threatened to kill her. The \"Teen Wolf\" star was walking her dog Wednesday night when the man screamed \"I'm going to motherf---ing kill you c--- and your f---ing dog,\" she said in an emotional Instagram post. Cho, a second-generation Korean American who also stars on \"Chicago Med,\" encouraged other people to speak up against anti-Asian racism and violence, which has increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. \nSimon Bassett, the character played by Regé-Jean Page, the breakout star of the Netflix series \"Bridgerton,\" will not return for the show's second season, Netflix and Shondaland, Shonda Rhimes' production company, announced Friday. The news was delivered, appropriately enough, via a missive from Lady Whistledown, the show's mysterious narrator - and sometimes instigator - of scandal. \nDMX's longtime New York-based lawyer, Murray Richman, said the rapper was on life support Saturday evening at White Plains Hospital. \"He had a heart attack. He's quite ill,\" Richman said. Richman said he could not confirm reports that DMX, 50, overdosed on drugs and was not sure what caused the heart attack. Over the years, DMX has battled with substance abuse. The rapper cancelled a series of shows to check himself into a rehabilitation facility in 2019. On Instagram, his team said he apologized for the cancelled shows. \nStar wire services\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
