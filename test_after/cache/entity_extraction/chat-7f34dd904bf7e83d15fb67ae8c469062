Four days after the initial diagnosis, the patient became Vo's first to die of COVID-19.\nVo didn't know what to say to the family,but they were nice enough to call me and inform me, 'DoctorVo,you triedyour best.Don't worry. Don't be sad.' ... They even encouraged me to continue to help other people.\nAsian Frontline Medics Face Hate Amid COVID-19\nThey've had to work amid a wave of pandemic-inspired anti-Asian attacks\nI've been a nurse for more than 30 years, I've been through the death and the birth, but this is an unbelievable for me... I did not follow the numbers because it's so discouraging, said AnchaleeDulayathitikul, 55, an intermediate care nurse. She arrived in the U.S. in 2014, after deciding she wanted an American education for her children.\nShe had opted for a nursing career because her grandfather thought she had a caring nature. Dulayathitikul earned her degree in nursing and midwifery in 1988 from Chiang Mai University in Thailand. More than a quarter century later, she passed all the tests in the battery needed for nursing certification in Maryland on her first sitting.\nShe works at the University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Medical Center and after a year, she told VOA Thai, I see the flow and I seehow wecantake care of (COVID-19 patients) successfully.\nDulayathitikul plans visit her unwell mother in Thailand once the pandemic, and its travel restrictions retreat. She will return to Maryland for her children and her career because I love my career a lot.\nDaruneeRasameloungon, 41, a Bangkok native who arrived in the U.S. in 1991 with her family to join her father who had emigrated ahead of them. She wanted to be an engineer or an FBI agent until she helped care for a cousin after a bus hit him, breaking his arms and legs.\nWhen she decided to pursue nursing, her father told her he couldn't pay for college on what he earned delivering pizza. Working with her high school counselor, Rasameloungon parlayed high grades, volunteer work and school activities into scholarships to pay for all four years at George Mason University's nursing school in Fairfax, Virginia. She graduated in 2001 and is now a progressive care unit nurse technician at Fairfax Hospital, where she has worked since 2008.\nIt's always hard, this is very sad when you have to wrap someone in the bag, you know, ... theydied by themselves, she told VOA Thai. They have nobody withthem,and their family cannot be with them, (it) is really sad ...todie by yourself. Itis really overwhelming. My God, you feel sorry for them. And it's just, like a reality hit: This . . . can happen to anybody.\nAlthough Rasameloungon intends to continue nursing in the U.S. in part to remain close to her son, she wants to take a long break in Thailand when the pandemic subsides because the COVID (made) me realize that I want to spend more time with my family.\nBorn in Menifee, California, LimyiHeng, 38, is the child of Cambodian refugees. He spent three years in the Air Force, most of the time in Southern California. But I did a lot of tours all around the United States, which gave me a deep appreciation for the diversity of America.\nHis Air Force mentor guided himinto a career as a nurse practitioner, and he earned his master's degree in nursing from Columbia University, where he developed a network that informed him early about the spread of COVID-19 in New York City and elsewhere. He works at Redlands Community Hospital and San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital.\nThe surge of COVID-19 cases began in October and continued through December. There wasn't really a worst moment. I think it was this really, the long hours, the long hours, Heng told VOA Cambodian. For him, the upside at work is being part of a team that includes hospital housekeepers, the logistics people who deliver protective gear and community leaders who provide the right messaging, the right information to drown out the misinformation.\nFor Conners, similar teamwork 2,600 is what leads to his proudest moments of the pandemic, when patients leave the ICU.This kind of a big accomplishment (is) from the teamwork that we have done.\nCambodian Service Chetra Chap; Indonesian Service Naras Prameswari and Dian Widyastuti; Mandarin Service Calla Yu; Thai Service Pinitkarn Tulachom;Tibetan Service; Trinlae Choedron and Ngawang Tenzin; Vietnamese Service An Hai; and Graphics, Mark Sandeen, contributed to this report. -VOA\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
