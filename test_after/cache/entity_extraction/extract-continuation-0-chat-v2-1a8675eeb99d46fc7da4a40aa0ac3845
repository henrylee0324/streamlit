Asian-Canadian women were targeted in about 60 percent of all incidents.\nAs Asian Canadians, our lives have been taken over by a constant sense of paralysing fear, said Avvy Go, clinic director of the Chinese & Southeast Asian Legal Clinic in Toronto, during a news briefing to unveil the report's findings.\nAsian-Canadian women like myself face an even greater risk of attack and regardless of whether we're a newcomer or fifth-generation Canadian, our sense of security has been shattered, she said.\nSlash by slash, wound by wound, each one of these incidents takes away from all Asian Canadians our sense of safety, robs us of our basic dignity, and ultimately undermines our sense of belonging in a country that we have every right to call home, she added.\nAsian Canadians had warned in early February 2020, when Canada had recorded only three cases of the coronavirus, that xenophobia was mounting, bringing back painful memories of what happened during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the early 2000s.\nTuesday's report comes one week after a gunman opened fire at three separate spas near the United States city of Atlanta, killing eight people. Six of the victims were Asian women.\nAsian community leaders have pointed to statements by right-wing leaders blaming China for the COVID-19 pandemic, such as former US President Donald Trump's use of the terms Chinese virus and kung flu, for the recent uptick in hate incidents.\nThey have also said decades of anti-Asian racism, misogyny and stereotypes against Asian women played a role in the violence.\nAnti-Asian hate crimes reported to police in 16 of the largest US cities increased by 145 percent in 2020, according to preliminary data released on Sunday by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.\nAnother report by the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center documented 3,795 hate incidents aimed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders between March 19, 2020 and February 28 of this year. Asian Americans have been shoved to the ground, assaulted, verbally harassed, shunned, and had their businesses vandalised in cities across the country, local media have reported.\nAmericans of all types experience this perception of being 'forever foreigners' in a wide range of ways, Pawan Dhingra, professor of sociology and American studies at Amherst College, said in a recent article in The Conversation.\nRegardless of whether some or all - or none - of these latest assaults on Asian Americans are proved to be hate crimes or not, race plays a historic role, Dhingra added.\nBut the US is not the only country to see a surge in anti-Asian hate during the pandemic - and the Atlanta attack has put a spotlight on rising anti-Asian hate incidents around the world over the past year.\nMore than 220 hate crimes against East Asians in the United Kingdom were reported to police between June and September 2020, a 96 percent jump compared to the same period in 2019, according to London metropolitan police data. In a November survey, Australian National University found that 84.5 percent of Asian Australians had experienced at least one instance of discrimination between January and October 2020.\nRacism and physical attacks on Asians and people of Asian descent have spread with the COVID-19 pandemic, and government leaders need to act decisively to address the trend, John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in May.\nMarie-Claude Landry, chief commissioner at the Canadian Human Rights Commission, an independent human rights watchdog, said on Tuesday that the report on anti-Asian hate incidents in Canada is a chilling reminder that racism, hatred and intolerance have no borders.\nOver the past year we have seen that disturbing rates in anti-Asian hate and COVID-driven racism. My hope is that today's report and the powerful data it presents can be used as a tool to confirm and confront this growing problem in Canada. It is at a crisis point, she said.\nMeanwhile, Asian-Canadian groups are calling for concrete action from all levels of government to address the problem.\nTuesday's report calls for more funding and other resources to allow community groups to provide anti-racism education, as well as bolster culturally-sensitive support services for victims of hate incidents.\nThe report also says particular focus must be paid to Asian Canadians who have been deemed essential workers during the pandemic, which puts them at increased risk of attacks - and ensuring that they have adequate workplace protections in place.\nOur sisters in Atlanta... were violently killed because of our failure to combat racism and misogyny, said Amy Go, president of Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice, an advocacy group, during the briefing.\nAsian-Canadian women should not be held hostage by fear and potential threats to our lives because of our failure. We need action now, Amy said. - FNA\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CANADA<|>GEO<|>Canada is a country where anti-Asian racism has reached a crisis point, as reported by community advocates and human rights experts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRITISH COLUMBIA<|>GEO<|>British Columbia is a province in Canada where 44% of reported anti-Asian hate incidents occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONTARIO<|>GEO<|>Ontario is the most populous province in Canada, where 40% of reported anti-Asian hate incidents occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVVY GO<|>PERSON<|>Avvy Go is the clinic director of the Chinese & Southeast Asian Legal Clinic in Toronto, who spoke about the impact of anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY GO<|>PERSON<|>Amy Go is the president of the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice, advocating for action against anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Human Rights Watch is an organization that advocates for human rights and has commented on the rise of anti-Asian hate during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Canadian Human Rights Commission is an independent watchdog that addresses issues of racism and intolerance in Canada.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE REPORTING CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center documents hate incidents aimed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE & EXTREMISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, studies hate crimes and reported a significant increase in anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in the United States where a gunman opened fire at spas, killing eight people, six of whom were Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to a rise in anti-Asian racism and hate incidents globally.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARS<|>EVENT<|>The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the early 2000s is referenced as a historical context for anti-Asian sentiments.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AVVY GO<|>CANADA<|>Avvy Go discussed the crisis of anti-Asian racism in Canada during a news briefing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY GO<|>CANADA<|>Amy Go called for action against anti-Asian racism in Canada<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH<|>CANADA<|>Human Rights Watch commented on the rise of anti-Asian hate in Canada during the pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION<|>CANADA<|>The Canadian Human Rights Commission addressed the issue of anti-Asian hate incidents in Canada<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE REPORTING CENTER<|>CANADA<|>The Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center documented hate incidents that also reflect trends in Canada<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE & EXTREMISM<|>CANADA<|>The Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism reported on the increase of anti-Asian hate crimes, which includes data relevant to Canada<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The Atlanta shooting incident is linked to the rise in anti-Asian hate during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SARS<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The SARS outbreak is referenced as a historical event that contributed to anti-Asian sentiments, similar to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
