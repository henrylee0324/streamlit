Video of the incident showed a crowd of people gathered around the\nwoman as she held an ice pack to a gash on her face and yelled in Chinese at the suspected attacker, who was\nhandcuffed to a stretcher.\n“You bum, why did you bully me?” the woman yelled in Chinese.\n“This bum, he bullied me,” she continued while facing the crowd. “He bullied me, this bum.\"\nThe attacker, who was said to be 39 years old, was arrested after he assaulted an 83-year-old Asian male and\nfled on foot, the San Francisco Police Department told the Washington Examiner in an email. He struck the 79-\nyear-old woman while fleeing a security guard who witnessed the first attack and was later detained, SFPD\nadded.\nBoth of the Asian victims were transported to a local hospital after the elderly woman told bystanders the man\npunched her without provocation as she leaned against a light pole. The suspect, however, was \"transported to a\nlocal hospital for an unrelated, prior medical condition,\" police said.\n\"Both assaults are believed to have been unprovoked,\" the department wrote. \"Investigators are working to\ndetermine if bias was a motivating factor in the incident. This investigation is active and ongoing.\"\nTweet\nWHITE HOUSE SAYS TRUMP'S COVID LANGUAGE ELEVATED THREAT TO ASIAN AMERICANS\nThe incident followed the apprehension of Robert Aaron Long, 21, who police said shot and killed eight people in\nthree Georgia Asian-owned spas on Tuesday.\nLong's arrest reignited scrutiny from the U.S. public relating to Asian hate crimes, which have risen since the\nonset of the coronavirus pandemic, because six of the eight victims who died appeared to be of Asian descent.\nLaw enforcement has not indicated that Tuesday's shooting was a hate crime, instead suggesting Long was\nsuffering from sex addiction and targeted the businesses to \"eliminate\" temptation.\nPresident Biden also declined to name a motive for the shooting, saying he is making \"no connection at this\nmoment to the motivation of the killer.\"\nOn Wednesday, San Francisco Mayor London Breed directed police in her city to “increase patrols in areas with a\nhigh number of Asian residents, visitors, and businesses immediately.”\n“No one should have to live in fear that their race or ethnicity could make them a victim,\" she added.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nBreed's law enforcement directive was mirrored by New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago, all of which\nbolstered police presence in Asian neighborhoods on Wednesday.\nAt least two Asian men, 94-year-old Vichar Ratanapakdee and 75-year-old Pak Ho, have died in California from\nassaults in recent weeks, and on Monday, 59-year-old Danny Yu Chang was severely beaten in San Francisco,\naccording to KPIX.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
