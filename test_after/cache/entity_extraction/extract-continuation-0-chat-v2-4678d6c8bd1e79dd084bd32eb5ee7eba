At least four victims were of Korean origin. While I was born in this country and I'm proud to be an American I am half Korean and half Japanese.\nIt is unclear whether the shooting victims were targeted because of their race. Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Wednesday that the suspect Robert Aaron Long 21 of Woodstock Georgia claimed that his actions weren't racially motivated and that he had a sexual addiction. \nI find it unsettling nevertheless because it comes at a time when anti-Asian sentiment and violence are on the rise in our country. Some blame people who look like me of being responsible for the so-called China virus more accurately known as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. \nIn the early months of the pandemic last year one woman on Facebook commenting on an article I wrote as business editor of The Daytona Beach News-Journal told me that I was a nothing who should go back to China. \nAnd I am not the only one. \nI recently interviewed a Daytona Beach Florida area family that runs a Korean restaurant. They told me they were being similarly harassed on nearly a daily basis both by people showing up in person to place orders and then refusing to pay for them as well as those calling them on the phone during their busy dinner rush.\n'I'm afraid'\nSaeHee Martin who owns the Chop Chop Korean Restaurant in South Daytona told me on Wednesday that she was frightened to learn about the Atlanta-area spa shootings: \"I'm afraid. I don't know what some crazy people are going to do.\" \nIt doesn't help that the shooter told police that he intended to drive to Florida to kill more people at spas. \nWhen I read the national news reports about anti-Asian hate crimes most seem to be happening in large cities that have a bigger percentage of Asian Americans. In King County Washington for example where I was born and raised those of Asian heritage account for nearly 20% of the population according to the latest Census Bureau statistics.\nHere in Volusia County where Daytona Beach is located Asians account for 2% of the population. \nThe Atlanta-area attacks show that anti-Asian hate crimes if in fact that's what motivated the shooter can also happen in communities where there are fewer Asians. \nIn Cherokee County Georgia where the first of the three spa shootings occurred Asians account for 2.1% of the population. \nEven some people I consider friends persist in referring to COVID-19 as the China virus. When I confront them about it I am told that's where it started. True but to blame all Asians or even all Chinese for the pandemic is flat out wrong. It suggests that we are all alike as if we were the Borg from \"Star Trek.\" \nGrowing up in a mostly white neighborhood in Seattle I was constantly told Asians are good in math (not true for me) and not so good in English or when it came to matters involving creativity and innovation. \nI am not a stereotype\nFor the record I double majored in English Lit and Journalism with a minor in art. I also played for many years in rock bands and won a local songwriter contest in the Daytona Beach area a few years ago. Conversely I am not skilled in kung fu or any of the martial arts and I am not particularly adept at using chopsticks although I try. \nAlike we Asian Americans are not. \nAnd as far as what country I pledge my allegiance to I am as proud as any of you to be an American. \nI have an uncle who fought in World War II in not against the United States Army as a member of the highly decorated 442nd infantry unit made up of Japanese Americans. He fought the Germans while one of his brothers was interned in a relocation camp for those of Japanese descent in California. \nMy wife and I have three sons all of whom have served in the U.S. military including one still in the Air Force. \nStop viewing us as \"others.\" We are Americans and we are human beings who don't deserve to be vilified or as in the apparent case of the Atlanta spa shooter objectified. \nMuch less targeted. \nClayton Park is business editor of The Daytona Beach News-Journal.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a major city in Georgia, where the shootings occurred, impacting the local community and beyond.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEROKEE COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Cherokee County is a county in Georgia where the first of the three spa shootings took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>PERSON<|>Robert Aaron Long is the 21-year-old suspect accused of carrying out the Atlanta-area shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANK REYNOLDS<|>PERSON<|>Frank Reynolds is the Cherokee County Sheriff who commented on the shootings and the suspect's motivations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAEHEE MARTIN<|>PERSON<|>SaeHee Martin is the owner of Chop Chop Korean Restaurant in South Daytona, expressing fear after the shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOP CHOP KOREAN RESTAURANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chop Chop Korean Restaurant is a restaurant in South Daytona owned by SaeHee Martin, which has faced harassment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAYTONA BEACH<|>GEO<|>Daytona Beach is a city in Florida where the author resides and where the Chop Chop Korean Restaurant is located.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING COUNTY<|>GEO<|>King County is a county in Washington where the author was born and raised, noted for its significant Asian American population.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLUSIA COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Volusia County is the county in Florida where Daytona Beach is located, with a smaller percentage of Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>442ND INFANTRY UNIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The 442nd Infantry Unit is a highly decorated unit made up of Japanese Americans that fought in World War II.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is the novel coronavirus pandemic that has led to increased anti-Asian sentiment and violence.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>FRANK REYNOLDS<|>Frank Reynolds commented on Robert Aaron Long's motivations regarding the shootings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAEHEE MARTIN<|>CHOP CHOP KOREAN RESTAURANT<|>SaeHee Martin owns Chop Chop Korean Restaurant, which has faced harassment following the shootings<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>CHEROKEE COUNTY<|>The shootings occurred in Atlanta, specifically in Cherokee County<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING COUNTY<|>ATLANTA<|>The author compares the anti-Asian sentiment in King County, where they were raised, to the events in Atlanta<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOLUSIA COUNTY<|>DAYTONA BEACH<|>Daytona Beach is located in Volusia County, where the author resides<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHEROKEE COUNTY<|>ATLANTA<|>Cherokee County is part of the Atlanta metropolitan area where the shootings took place<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>442ND INFANTRY UNIT<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>The author references the 442nd Infantry Unit in contrast to the actions of Robert Aaron Long<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>ANTI-ASIAN SENTIMENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to rising anti-Asian sentiment and violence<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
