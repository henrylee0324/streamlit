She doesn't find social media platforms punish the accounts that spread hateful information against Asians. \n\"During the presidential election, they did close Trump's social media account. I am not aware if they closed any of the Asian haters' accounts,\" she said. \n\"Because it is very politically related and I don't think the profit-driven tech companies have the drive or motivation to close the accounts,\" she stressed. \nHatred never gone \nMore than a year after the novel coronavirus, Asian Americans still struggled with hatred flooding various social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. \nNam pointed to some American politicians directly mentioning racial issues in public, and both traditional and social media consistently delivered their messages. \nFormer president Donald Trump used racist rhetoric, claiming [the] coronavirus is originated from Wuhan of China, and calling coronavirus [the] Wuhan or Chinese virus. Senator Blackburn of Tennessee State also tweeted [about] the Sinophobia issues by using some uncomfortable texts, Nam said. \nIn October 2020, a US marine, Jarrett Morford, used racial slurs against Chinese people and threatened to shoot them in a viral video tweet, and said \"China is going to pay for what they have done to this country and the world.\" The video is still trackable on Twitter now. \nIn another video recorded in July 2020, a tech industry CEO was caught on camera yelling racist slurs against and taunting an Asian American family at a birthday celebration in a restaurant. After public anger surged after the video gained over 1 million views on Instagram, he was forced to apologize and resign from his post. \nSpurred on by some US politicians, onslaught, hate crimes, and anti-Chinese discourse have become more common across social media. \nThe Global Times found some hateful remarks against Asians, or comments that contain undertones of prejudice or stereotypes on Twitter. They attack the Chinese government and people under the guise of \"protecting the human rights\" of other ethnicities. \nThe ADL released a survey last month that showed \"severe\" harassment such as \"stalking, physical threats, swatting, doxing or sustained harassment\" has been on the rise for Asian Americans. About 17 percent of Asian Americans said in January they experienced severe online harassment compared with 11 percent during the same period in 2020, the largest uptick compared with other groups. About half said they were harassed because of their race, US media CNET reported. \nThere have been ongoing debates regarding the idea that accounts spreading discrimination and hate against Asians should be banned on social media, Nam said. \"I feel definitely uncomfortable with the discrimination toward Asian people, but I have no clue how the social media policy can be reformed.\" \nNam believes that the US and its people are also affected by the widespread of anti-Asian disinformation on social media, because the trend hurts the country's own image in the international community. \n\"When social media contributes to developing racial discrimination in this specific time of a global health crisis, a lot of individuals may have cultivated the sense of anti- American sentiments in the contemporary global society.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ONG<|>PERSON<|>A person who critiques social media platforms for their handling of hateful information against Asians and discusses the political implications of their actions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAM<|>PERSON<|>A person who highlights the ongoing struggles of Asian Americans with hatred on social media and discusses the impact of US politicians on racial issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Former president of the United States known for using racist rhetoric regarding the coronavirus and its origins.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENATOR BLACKBURN<|>PERSON<|>A politician from Tennessee who has tweeted about Sinophobia issues, contributing to the discourse on racial issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JARRETT MORFORD<|>PERSON<|>A US marine who used racial slurs against Chinese people in a viral video, threatening violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL TIMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A media outlet that reported on hateful remarks against Asians on social media platforms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Anti-Defamation League, which released a survey showing an increase in severe online harassment against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A social media platform where hateful information against Asians has been prevalent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWITTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A social media platform that has been used to spread hateful remarks against Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTAGRAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A social media platform where a video of a tech CEO yelling racist slurs gained significant attention.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>The global pandemic that has been associated with increased racial discrimination against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ONG<|>NAM<|>Both Ong and Nam discuss the impact of social media on the spread of hatred against Asians and the political implications involved.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAM<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Nam references Trump's use of racist rhetoric regarding the coronavirus, linking it to the broader issue of anti-Asian sentiment.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAM<|>SENATOR BLACKBURN<|>Nam mentions Senator Blackburn's tweets about Sinophobia, indicating a connection to the racial issues discussed.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JARRETT MORFORD<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>Morford's actions of using racial slurs can be seen as a reflection of the rhetoric used by Trump, contributing to the same discourse.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL TIMES<|>NAM<|>The Global Times reported on the hateful remarks against Asians that Nam discusses, indicating a connection in their focus on the issue.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADL<|>NAM<|>The ADL's survey on harassment aligns with Nam's observations about the increase in online harassment against Asian Americans.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>ONG<|>Ong criticizes Facebook for not punishing accounts spreading hate, linking her views directly to the platform's actions.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWITTER<|>NAM<|>Nam points out the prevalence of hateful remarks against Asians on Twitter, establishing a direct relationship between the platform and the issue.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTAGRAM<|>NAM<|>Nam references a viral video on Instagram that highlights the issue of racism against Asians, connecting the platform to the discussion.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>NAM<|>Nam discusses how the pandemic has exacerbated anti-Asian sentiments, linking the event to the ongoing racial issues.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
