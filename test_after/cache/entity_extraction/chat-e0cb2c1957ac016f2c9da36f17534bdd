The attack stirred fear among Asian-American communities, which have seen increasing racist abuse since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn a statement dated Thursday, the Fulton County medical examiner's office released the names of the four women killed at the Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa in the city's Piedmont Heights neighborhood. Atlanta authorities released the names of four of the victims killed at Young's Asian Massage spa in Cherokee County earlier in the week.\nThe names of the eight people who died, as released by authorities, are Daoyou Feng, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Hyun J. Grant, Soon C. Park, Suncha Kim, and Yong A. Yue.\nHere's what we know so far about them.\nDaoyou Feng, 44\nFeng was a recently hired employee at Young's Asian Massage. An editor at the World Journal, a Chinese-language news site with offices in Atlanta, told the Washington Post that its reporters had not been able to ascertain anything yet about Feng — not even the proper Chinese characters for her name. The editor said it is still unclear whether she had ties to China, Taiwan, or another country.\nPaul Andre Michels, 54, of Tucker, Ga.\nMichels was a businessman and a veteran of the US Army infantry, where he served in the late 1980s, according to his brother. His brother said Michels was doing work for the spa and “might have been talking with the spa's owner about how the business operates” because he was thinking of opening a spa himself. Michels was one of nine siblings. He had been married for more than 20 years and was a Catholic, and was a strong political conservative. He grew up in southwest Detroit and moved to Georgia 25 years ago for work, his brother told the New York Times. Michels was one of the four victims shot at Young's Asian Massage.\nXiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw, Ga.\nTan was the owner of Young's Asian Massage. She would have turned 50 on Thursday. Tan, or Emily as she was known by friends, was dedicated to her job and her daughter, a recent University of Georgia graduate, a friend and customer told the Washington Post. Tan's family is from China, and she sometimes hosted Lunar New Year and Fourth of July parties with food and fireworks at her spa.\n“She was a very good friend, a kind, sweet person,” Greg Hynson told the paper.\nTan's 29-year-old daughter, Jami Webb, told USA Today Tan worked “every day, 12 hours a day, so that me and our family would have a better life.”\n“She did everything for me and for the family,” Webb said. “She provided everything.”\nMichael Webb met Tan while traveling for work in China in the early 2000s, according to USA Today, and they got married in 2004. He legally adopted Jami in 2006 before the family moved from Florida to Georgia, where Tan opened her first business, a nail salon.\nShe and Michael remained friends after they split up in 2012. Michael, a contractor, helped Tan remodel Young's Asian Massage, her second business, last year while it was closed due to COVID-19.\n“She'd always say, 'we family,'” Michael told USA Today. “Even when we got divorced, she'd say that: 'We family.' Because that's how she was.”\nJami and Michael spent Tan's 50th birthday planning her funeral.\nDelaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth, Ga.\nYaun, 33, was visiting Young's Asian Massage spa for the first time with her husband on the night of the shooting. They booked a couples massage and were in separate rooms when the gunman entered and started shooting, according to a relative. Yaun's husband survived, and was locked in a nearby room as gunshots rang out. Yaun was one of four siblings who grew up in the area, and had worked as a server at a Waffle House restaurant. She raised a 13-year-old son as a single mother and had an 8-month-old daughter over the summer with her husband. She was close with her family and her mother lived with her as well.\nHyun Jung Grant, 51\nGrant's son, Randy Park, told The Daily Beast in an interview that Grant “was a single mother of two kids who dedicated her whole life to raising them.”\nHe said he got a call Tuesday evening from the daughter of a survivor who had been next to Grant when the shooting happened.\nPark spoke about the need to take care of his little brother in the wake of his mom's death.\n“You see this stuff in TV shows and movies,” Park said. “It's surreal. But I have a younger brother that I have to take care of now, so as much as I want to be sad and grieve — and I am super sad — I have no choice but to move on. To figure out the whole living situation for probably the next year with my brother.”\nPark said Grant wasn't just his mother but also his friend who he could tell anything to.\nGrant loved to go “dancing and partying,” Park said. They would go out for sushi every night before she left for work.\nIn a GoFundMe page started by Park, he said he and his brother don't have other family members in the country.\n“The rest of my family is in South Korea and are unable to come,” he wrote. “She was one of my best friends and the strongest influence on who we are today.
