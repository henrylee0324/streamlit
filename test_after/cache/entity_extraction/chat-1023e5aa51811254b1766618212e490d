W. Shen, a petite Chinese American woman in her 70s, was on her daily walk in Medford when out of nowhere she was shoved to the ground by a stranger who muttered, \"Chink bitch,\" before sprinting off. \nThe incident took place in broad daylight near a busy playground, but no one offered to help her as she sat on the curb, clutching a tissue to her bleeding head, Shen said. Doctors at the emergency room later told her she likely suffered a concussion. \nRecalling the attack, Shen said she felt like the 65-year-old Filipino woman in New York City whose brutal beating just one day before hers was caught on video as security guards in a nearby building watched and locked the doors. \n\"People usually jump to help someone if they have fallen down,\" said Shen. \"It's as if we are not seen as really belonging to American society, so it feels OK to treat us differently.\" \nShen had a similar experience a year ago in March, at the beginning of the pandemic. She was crossing at an intersection when two white men in a SUV drove right up to her, spitting and screaming: \"Virus, bitch!\" \nThat time, Shen managed to angrily yell back a profanity. \nAs infuriating as the incident was, Shen said what made her even more mad was this: The racist assault took place in front of a bus stop in Medford where a dozen people were waiting. \n\"Nobody did anything,\" Shen recalled. (To protect Shen's identity, the Globe is using her Chinese name.) \nShen's experiences were never captured in police logs because she, like many Asian Americans, are reluctant to report a hate crime. For some, it is a language barrier, while others fear retaliation, or, as in the case of Shen, they simply don't trust law enforcement. \nFor these reasons, the incidents that are reported plainly represent a fraction of the actual number. An organization called Stop AAPI Hate has tried to quantify the real number by collecting reports from the Asian American community, and identified 3,795 incidents across the country over roughly the first year of the pandemic. \nBut here in Massachusetts, police departments in Lowell and Quincy, cities with sizable Asian American populations, say they do not have a single report of a hate crime against Asian Americans over the past year. Boston and other major cities, however, have seen a sharp rise in anti-Asian hate crime since 2019, even as the overall numbers of hate crimes have declined. \nBoston recorded 14 anti-Asian incidents primarily verbal assaults in 2020, up from eight in 2019. Already in 2021, the city has eight reported cases, according to the Boston Police Department. That compares to 16 reports of hate crimes against Black people and one against a Hispanic person this year. \nAnti-Asian hate has been surging as some people, looking for a scapegoat or blinded by bigotry, blame COVID-19 on China. Elderly Asian Americans, in particular, feel under attack after a spate of incidents in New York and Califomia were caught on video and went viral. One 84-year-old Thai immigrant died in January after being barreled to the ground outside his San Francisco home. \nLocal Asian American groups say they are unaware of similar assaults against seniors. But the March 16 mass shooting in the Atlanta area that killed eight - including six Asian American women is heightening fears of potential violence spreading here. \n- \nAll of which raises the question: What kind of society are we when senior citizens are picked off for blood sport? For many Asian Americans, myself included, this crosses a line. We are a culture that fiercely values those of the older generation who made sacrifices to allow their children to have a better life in America. To attack them is to attack our very essence. To have to tell our parents and grandparents to watch their backs is heartbreaking. I am certain if white seniors had been the victims, this country would have declared a national emergency by now. \nHow J.H. Tang, 72, lives her life is the new normal for many older Asian Americans. The South End resident avoids going out alone, and, when she steps outside, she takes a good look around. \n\"I never really felt this kind of fear,\" Tang said in Cantonese, speaking through a translator. \"I feel like the Chinese are especially being targeted. We are treated like enemies, like we all have the virus.\" \nHer son recently bought her pepper spray, but the grandmother of five wasn't sure what to do with it. \n\"I am afraid of using it,\" Tang said. \"What if they have a weapon? I don't want to escalate the situation.\" \nVivian Tseng, a 69-year-old retired corporate lawyer in Concord, had a completely different response after the Atlanta murders: She decided to learn how to shoot a gun. Like many Asian Americans, Tseng has been feeling invisible and helpless after a year of growing anti-Asian sentiment. \n\"It's driven by rage and a sense of aloneness,\" Tseng said. \"If I don't do something for myself, nobody is going to save me.\" \nLong Nguyen, father of state Representative Tram Nguyen, was an undercover police officer in Vietnam. But now, at age 67 and living in Methuen, he is scared to leave his house. In frail health, he knows he cannot defend himself. \n\"If people beat me, I can die right away,\" said Nguyen. \nHe tells his wife to come straight home from work and not run unnecessary errands. He also advises her to wear a mask and a hat. \"Don't let people recognize you as Vietnamese,\" he said. \nWhen Nguyen learned about the beating of an 83-year-old Vietnamese immigrant in San Francisco that took place\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
