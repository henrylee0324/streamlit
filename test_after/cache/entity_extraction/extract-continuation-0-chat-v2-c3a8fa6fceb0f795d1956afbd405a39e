He's been relieved so far to see that it's not been a local problem, but Atlanta's violence has him bracing in a new way.\nHe hopes that people outside of the Asian community can understand how unsettling these incidents have been for so many.\n\"If your neighbor fears for their safety, that is not a good community,\" Cho said.\nThe solution to that, Chen believes, is the community rallying behind its Asian neighbors. A \"chorus of non-Asian voices\" calling out bad behavior or supporting someone who's been a victim could create the kind of atmosphere that stifles such racism.\nSeshadri also believes that grassroots change rather than additional policing is the way forward. Education about the history of anti-Asian hate and discrimination can create a foundation, but action in the form of community support and investment will be the key, he said. The need for better housing and health care for the most vulnerable populations of Asian Americans and immigrant communities are essential issues that make fewer headlines than hate crimes, he said.\n\"We're Asian from sunup to sundown, and there are so many other pieces, besides hate crimes, that need to be dealt with,\" Seshadri said. \"But more than anything else we cannot let this be just a flash in the pan, otherwise more things like what happened in Atlanta, are going to keep happening again.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHO<|>PERSON<|>Cho is an individual who has been addressing incidents of anti-Asian bias and violence, advocating for community support and understanding.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEN<|>PERSON<|>Chen believes in community rallying behind Asian neighbors to combat anti-Asian racism and support victims.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SESHADRI<|>PERSON<|>Seshadri advocates for grassroots change and education about anti-Asian hate, emphasizing the need for community support and investment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city experiencing incidents of violence that have raised concerns within the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asian Americans are a community facing issues of bias, violence, and the need for better housing and health care.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHO<|>ATLANTA<|>Cho is concerned about the violence occurring in Atlanta and its impact on the Asian community<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHEN<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Chen advocates for the Asian American community, emphasizing the importance of support from non-Asian individuals<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SESHADRI<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Seshadri highlights the essential issues faced by Asian Americans beyond hate crimes, advocating for community investment<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SESHADRI<|>ATLANTA<|>Seshadri's comments reflect the broader issues of violence and discrimination affecting communities in Atlanta<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHO<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Cho encourages the community to report incidents affecting Asian Americans and to foster understanding<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
