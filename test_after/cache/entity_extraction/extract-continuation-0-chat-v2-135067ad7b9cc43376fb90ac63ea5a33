The suspect claimed he was frustrated over a sexual addiction, authorities said.\nThe shooting was a horror, but it did not shock many Asian American residents of Sonoma County interviewed Thursday. They have watched with anxious attention as a rise in crimes targeting Asian Americans, especially elders, have been reported across the Bay Area. They have felt the jabs from former President Donald Trump, who publicly described the coronavirus in racist terms — like the “Kung flu.“\nThat was already enough to move Barbosa, 29, a Filipina-American, to help organize a demonstration denouncing anti-Asian violence in February at Old Courthouse Square in downtown Santa Rosa.\nSo when news came out of Georgia that a 21-year-old white man opened fire at not one but three massage spas, there was no question in her mind that the violence was rooted in a toxic mix of racism and misogyny long aimed at Asian women.\n“My mother did warn me on the side of caution, ’Just please be careful,’” Barbosa said. “My ethnicity might represent something to another person’s eye, so I have to be more careful. I’m livid about that, truthfully.”\nJust last week, Santa Rosa Junior College trustees passed a resolution to demonstrate solidarity with Asian American Pacific Islander communities, a statement meant to counter recent violence and a sense that “the recent epidemic of COVID-19 has been falsely blamed on AAPI individuals.”\nSRJC president Frank Chong draws a direct line from that hateful rhetoric to the violence in Georgia.\n“Messages put out by our former president have hurt, and they have been a call to action for hate groups,” Chong said in an interview.\nViolence hit home in November for Chong and his family when his older brother was attacked in Oakland by four youths who took his phone and tried to steal his car, according to Chong. His brother is 73, has Parkinson’s disease and cancer, and no longer feels safe leaving his house.\nThe assault felt like a flashback to the mid-1980s when Chong helped organize community meetings in Oakland to help stem violence targeted at refugees from Asia who had come to the Bay Area. Chong said he is deeply concerned to hear the murders in Atlanta aren’t being treated as hate crimes mired in America’s long history of discrimination against Asian people.\n“We feel under siege right now. It’s shaken us to our core,” Chong said. “For the first time I feel wary about going out. Will I be insulted and marginalized?”\nThe shooter has been charged with eight counts of murder but no hate crimes. A spokesman for the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office drew ire after describing the day of the shooting as the result of “a really bad day” for the suspect. The spokesman had also previously posted images of T-shirts on social media echoing Trump’s anti-Asian rhetoric, calling the coronavirus an “imported virus from Chy-na,” according to the New York Times.\nPetaluma resident Kimi Stout, 35, quit her server job at the Girl & the Fig restaurant in Sonoma last month after she said she was told she couldn’t wear a mask with the words “Black Lives Matter” on it.\nStout said she felt it was essential to make a stand at a time when the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor had surfaced the deep grief of Black America. Tuesday’s violence in Atlanta felt deeply personal and “devastating,” said Stout, who is Chinese-Filipina American.\n“It’s almost as devastating to hear people say, ’We asked him if it was racially motivated and he said no,’ ” Stout said. “To take his word for it? For an officer of the law to excuse him as having a bad day? It doesn’t surprise me that something like this happened.”\nBodega Bay resident Jon Yatabe, 83, said he fears the violence shows that the country has not progressed far enough away from the kind of racism that led to the internment of the Japanese during World War II.\nYatabe was about 5 years old in 1942 when his family, who had a flower business in Redwood City, was imprisoned, and forced to move into the horse stables at Tanforan Racetrack in San Bruno. They were later shipped to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah while his father joined the 442nd Infantry Regiment, sent to the front lines of the European theater.\nYatabe said the last year has revived that sense of fear and insecurity that pervaded the fabric of life when he was a child. He became worried for his son, an attorney in Colorado near reports of anti-Asian violence.\n“I hear about violence like that, and I just think back on all violence against all minorities, not just Asians, violence against blacks, against Latinos,” Yatabe said. “It brings back a fear that the country hasn’t really progressed from where we once were.”\nSanta Rosa mother Chantavy Tornado helped Escalante organize February’s anti-Asian violence demonstration in Santa Rosa.\nTuesday, Tornado said she was talking on the phone with Rohnert Park City Vice Mayor Jackie Elward, who was recently called racial slurs by an anonymous caller who told her to “go back to Africa,” when she started receiving messages about the mass shooting in Atlanta.\nOne week earlier, Tornado, who is Khmer and the daughter of survivors of Cambodia’s killing fields, was walking with her 7-year-old son on West Third Street when someone driving past cursed at them and yelled a racial slur used against Chinese people.\nA lifetime of experiences, including the deep betrayal of a white man who abused T\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FLAMEZ GRILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flamez Grill is a restaurant located in Petaluma where Elizabeth Barbosa and her mother had dinner.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELIZABETH BARBOSA<|>PERSON<|>Elizabeth Barbosa is a 29-year-old Filipina-American who is concerned about safety due to rising anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city where a mass shooting occurred at three massage businesses, resulting in eight deaths.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANTA ROSA<|>GEO<|>Santa Rosa is a city in California where community members organized a demonstration against anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANTA ROSA JUNIOR COLLEGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Santa Rosa Junior College is an educational institution that passed a resolution to show solidarity with AAPI communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANK CHONG<|>PERSON<|>Frank Chong is the president of Santa Rosa Junior College who commented on the connection between hateful rhetoric and violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIMI STOUT<|>PERSON<|>Kimi Stout is a 35-year-old Petaluma resident who quit her job due to restrictions on wearing a \"Black Lives Matter\" mask.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON YATABE<|>PERSON<|>Jon Yatabe is an 83-year-old resident of Bodega Bay who reflects on past racism and fears for the future.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANTAVY TORNADO<|>PERSON<|>Chantavy Tornado is a Santa Rosa mother who helped organize a demonstration against anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHNERT PARK<|>GEO<|>Rohnert Park is a city where Vice Mayor Jackie Elward was subjected to racial slurs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACKIE ELWARD<|>PERSON<|>Jackie Elward is the Vice Mayor of Rohnert Park who received racial slurs from an anonymous caller.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>PERSON<|>George Floyd was a victim of police violence, whose death sparked widespread protests and discussions about racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREONNA TAYLOR<|>PERSON<|>Breonna Taylor was a victim of police violence, whose death also contributed to the Black Lives Matter movement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a pandemic that has been falsely blamed on AAPI individuals, contributing to anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELIZABETH BARBOSA<|>SANTA ROSA<|>Elizabeth Barbosa is involved in community efforts in Santa Rosa to address anti-Asian violence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK CHONG<|>SANTA ROSA JUNIOR COLLEGE<|>Frank Chong is the president of Santa Rosa Junior College, which passed a resolution supporting AAPI communities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIMI STOUT<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>Kimi Stout's activism is influenced by the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHANTAVY TORNADO<|>SANTA ROSA<|>Chantavy Tornado helped organize a demonstration in Santa Rosa against anti-Asian violence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JACKIE ELWARD<|>ROHNERT PARK<|>Jackie Elward is the Vice Mayor of Rohnert Park, where she faced racial slurs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON YATABE<|>COVID-19<|>Jon Yatabe reflects on the impact of COVID-19 and racism on the Asian community<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELIZABETH BARBOSA<|>COVID-19<|>Elizabeth Barbosa's concerns about safety are linked to the rise in anti-Asian violence during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK CHONG<|>COVID-19<|>Frank Chong connects the hateful rhetoric during COVID-19 to the violence against Asian Americans<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
