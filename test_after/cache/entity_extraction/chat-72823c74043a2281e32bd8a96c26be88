It's very sad to see that happening. I know that [OC Health Officer Dr. Clayton Chau] has taken the brunt of it, (Board) Chairman [Andrew] Do as well.\" \nDo told AsAmNews back in July that he's faced racism during his entire six years on the board, but it has increased of late. \n\"I think the the language coming from the last administration stoked that fire, legitimized the fringe elements to come out, and and if anything, feel more legitimate,\" said Do who is a Republican. \"They feel like, hey, maybe these racist thoughts that I have are not so out of the ordinary, if people at the very top talk the way I do.\" \nThe Times reports Black people make up less than 2% of Orange County's population, but were the most targeted. Asian Americans were the most frequently targeted. \n\"It really goes without saying that there is a lot of work to be done in our county and across the country,\" said Nhi Nguyen, the hate crime prevention coordinator for the Orange County Human Relations Commission.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
