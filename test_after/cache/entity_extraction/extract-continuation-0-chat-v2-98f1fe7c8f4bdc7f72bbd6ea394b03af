He went on to kill another four people at two other spas.\nInstead Jami Webb 29 and her father Michael Webb 64 spent Tan’s birthday planning her funeral at a Catholic church.\n“She did everything for me and for the family. She provided everything. She worked every day 12 hours a day so that me and our family would have a better life” Jami Webb said of her mother.\nLike Tan most of the victims of the shooting attacks were of Asian descent drawing new attention to an ongoing wave of hate crimes against Asian Americans across the country fueled by racism and xenophobia amid the COVID-19 outbreak and anti-China rhetoric expressed by many conservative leaders including former President Donald Trump.\nAs dusk fell Thursday night father daughter and her fiancé stood outside Young's Asian Massage in Acworth watching a small candlelight vigil honoring the dead.\nNo one there knew who they were and neither Webb sought any attention or recognition.\nSome called her by her Chinese name Xiaojie or Jay for short. Others knew her by her American name Emily.\nIn China it is customary to put the family name before the given name. Tan's name in Chinese transliterated to Tan Xiao Jie which means pure or honest. However because Western countries use the surname last her legal name in the United States is Xiaojie Tan.\n\"She was full of smiles and laughter. She was just a pleasure to be around” said Michael Webb an American businessman who first met Tan while traveling for work in China in the early 2000s.\nHe angrily rejected speculation Tan's spa was providing sex services.\n\"You're coming here to get a massage. All these girls that have worked for her over the years are working for her on their own free will\" he said. \"They’re here for a better life. They’re diligent and work hard and all the money they make is going toward a better life for their family.”\nHynson said he last saw Tan over the weekend when he stopped by the spa to chat.\n“I can’t put any reasoning behind why anyone would want to do something horrible to such nice people\" he said. \"I can’t wrap my head around it. I just can’t believe she’s gone.”\nAtlanta spa shootings: Illicit reviews raise red flags that shooter targeted vulnerable women\nSaying goodbye to a mother and best friend\nJami Webb said her mother was obsessed with the idea of traveling and devoured travel stories from her customers adding new destinations to her running list whenever they came back from a trip: Alaska. Europe. Sweden.\nWhenever a customer walked in Tan always had the same question: “where have you traveled?”\nIf it was a new location or country she would add it to her retirement wish list.\nJami Webb said she was proud of her mother and the business she had built. “She loved to make friends with all her customers\" she said.\nEarlier that day Jami Webb went to her mothers' house and found drawers full of new clothes.\n“They still had all the tags on\" Jami Webb said the petals blowing from flowering Bradford pear trees sticking to her teary eyes. \"She didn’t even have a chance to wear them.”\nMeanwhile in China family members gathered to celebrate what should have been Tan's 50th birthday. \nJami said her aunt her mother's sister Tan Mei had heart problems and needed to be put on oxygen when she found out about the killings.\n\"My sister was a very kind and caring person. She was always thinking about her family she cared very much for her friends\" Tan Mei told USA TODAY Friday sobbing over the phone from Nanning China. \nShe said Tan would call every day to speak to her family in China while on her way to work. She said could not fathom why someone would do such a senseless thing to her sister. The family couldn't bring themselves to tell Tan's mother that her daughter was dead. Instead the family cut a cake and called Jami Webb to ask about the guest of honor. \"She kept asking to talk to my mom. We told my grandma that my mom lost her phone and couldn't answer\" Jami Webb said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>PERSON<|>Xiaojie Tan was a business owner in the United States, known for her dedication to her family and her work, who was tragically killed in a shooting incident on her 50th birthday.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMI WEBB<|>PERSON<|>Jami Webb is the daughter of Xiaojie Tan, who was deeply affected by her mother's death and described her as a best friend and a dedicated family member.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICHAEL WEBB<|>PERSON<|>Michael Webb is Jami Webb's father, who expressed his grief over the loss of Xiaojie Tan and defended her business against false accusations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN MASSAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Young's Asian Massage is the business owned by Xiaojie Tan, where she was killed during a shooting incident.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the city where the shooting incident occurred, leading to the deaths of Xiaojie Tan and several others.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is the country where Xiaojie Tan's family resides and where her birthday was being celebrated while the tragedy unfolded in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANDLELIGHT VIGIL<|>EVENT<|>A candlelight vigil was held in honor of the victims of the shooting, including Xiaojie Tan, attended by family and friends.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>JAMI WEBB<|>Xiaojie Tan is the mother of Jami Webb, who described her as a best friend and a dedicated family member<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN MASSAGE<|>Xiaojie Tan was the owner of Young's Asian Massage, where she was tragically killed<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMI WEBB<|>MICHAEL WEBB<|>Jami Webb is the daughter of Michael Webb, and they both mourn the loss of Xiaojie Tan<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL WEBB<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN MASSAGE<|>Michael Webb defended the reputation of Young's Asian Massage, where his daughter was killed<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>ATLANTA<|>Xiaojie Tan was killed in a shooting incident that took place in Atlanta<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMI WEBB<|>CHINA<|>Jami Webb's family in China was celebrating her mother's birthday while mourning her death<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANDLELIGHT VIGIL<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN MASSAGE<|>The candlelight vigil was held outside Young's Asian Massage to honor the victims of the shooting<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>CHINA<|>Xiaojie Tan's family in China was affected by her death, as they were celebrating her birthday<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
