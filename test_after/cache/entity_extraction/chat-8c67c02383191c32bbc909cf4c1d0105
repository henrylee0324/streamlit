However, for many living\nin this country, the detrimental effects of\nthis virus may still be ongoing.\nLong before the pandemic, the Asian\npopulation in the United States had\nbeen viewed and treated as the physical\nembodiment of foreignness and disease, and\nthis stigma does not disappear because you\nare a medical worker wearing a white coat.\nAs the stress levels of society elevated with\nthe outbreak of a China-originated virus, the\nincrease in negative bias against the Asian\npopulation was perhaps not surprising.\nWhen I first moved to the United States\nto advance my career, it was right at the peak\nof the pandemic. News of racist assaults\nand ignorant attacks against Asians were\nbroadcast, and I can recall some headlines\nsaying ‘the assaults are spreading faster than\nthe coronavirus’. Although I live in one of\nthe most Asian-friendly states, in California,\nit was not easy to reassure myself and others\nabout my personal safety.\nWhile many can practice social isolation\nby working from home, most healthcare\nworkers are still meeting people of all\nethnic backgrounds and personal values.\nBorn and raised in a country with limited\nunderstanding about racial discrimination,\nI was prepared for possible hostility from\npeople of different skin colors. “To some,everyone with yellow skin either has COVID-\n19, or should be partially responsible for theimpact of COVID-19 in this country,” said\none of my Asian American friends. Were\nAsian healthcare workers treated aggressively\nby racist patients? Yes. Were they teased\ndisrespectfully on subjects about COVID-19?Of course. However, because of our jobs as\nhealthcare workers, we are used to ignoring\nsuch comments and suppressing our feelings\nwhen we encounter discrimination.\nI later realized that racism does not\ncome only from patients. Occasionally,\ndiscrimination against Asians, including\nmicroaggressions, can be observed within the\nmedical community. These microaggressions\nmay be an anonymous comment in an\nonline physician forum, a careless statement\nrecorded in an academic interview, an\nignorant joke told by some hospital workers\npassing by, or even an unconscious act of a\ncolleague. Physical attacks are not common\nin our work environments, but emotional and\nverbal aggressions can be seen in all forms\nand from all sources. Are these comments\nrepeated when people leave work and interact\nwith others in non-medical professions? We\ncannot know. Nevertheless, with the public\ninfluence of healthcare workers, due to their\nprofessional roles, even the least intended\ndiscriminative language may worsen the\noverall effect on society. Sometimes I would\ntell myself, “You may need to fight not\nonly the coronavirus, but also the racism\nin your working environment.” In the time\nof COVID-19, this fear of Asian healthcare\nworkers can be easily learned.\nIt is undeniable that Asian healthcare\nworkers have suffered from an aggravated\nnegative bias because of the COVID-19\npandemic. However, I have also learned\nto appreciate the opposite side of this; the\npursuit of diversity and equality is also a\nshared goal for many in this country. Owing\nto my cultural background, in the past I\nwas unaware that not being discriminated\nagainst on the basis of your skin color is\nessential for good mental health. Now I am\ngrateful that I work in a department that has\nlong focused on diversity and equality issues.\nI have also witnessed many non-Asian\nmedical workers using their voices to help\neliminate anti-Asian sentiments. Seeing the\nefforts of colleagues and strangers, I feel\nencouraged to speak up for other Asianhealthcare workers who may or may not\nbe lucky enough to feel safe, secure and\nrespected during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith the rapid distribution of vaccines\nin the United States, it is estimated that\nnormality may resume imminently. Beyond\nthe control of COVID-19, it is unclear what\nother aspects of normality should be expected.\nThe balance between public health and\ninfection? The resumption of social activities?\nOr the recovery of a thriving economy?\nIn addition to the number of infections\nand hospitalizations, the complications of\naggravated racism in certain populations\nmust be considered. Recovery from the social\nand psychological aspects of the COVID-19\npandemic will take longer than recovery from\nthe disease. This will require medical workers\nto attend to the racism-related experiences\nand mental health needs of not only their\npatients but also their co-workers.\nCOVID-19 swept through and shook\nthe United States on multiple levels.\nThe pandemic revealed not only the\nweakness of the human immune system\nand the US healthcare system but also\nthe underestimated extent of racial\ndiscrimination in society and within the\nmedical community. COVID-19 has taught a\nlesson that we are grateful for, but also fearful\nof. For many Asian healthcare workers, the\nnegative experience we have gone through\nmay not be cured or healed easily. The road\nto recovery is long, and for everyone working\nin the medical field, this is one important\ngoal we should fight together for.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
