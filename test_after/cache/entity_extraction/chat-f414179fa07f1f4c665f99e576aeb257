We give you this glorious title, but it keeps us away, it makes us feel very foreign.\" \n\"We're thought of as self-supporting and people who make a lot of money, and that makes us targets,\" said Wen Gu, a librarian from Cherry Hill. \n\"Many Americans don't want to take the time to really leam about us, so they lump us all together,\" said Gao, who is on the faculty of Rutgers University's biomedical and health services department. \"They think we are all the same, we all eat weird food and speak a weird language, that we are not Americans.\" \n\"People don't notice us because we keep our heads down and we work hard,\" said Doris Zheng, a 21-year-old Rutgers-Camden student. Her family emigrated from a small city in Southeast China more than 20 years ago; her father is a chef and her mother is a home health aide. \nZheng, vice president of the university's Student Government Association, said she's supportive of Black and brown people's struggles with systemic racism in American. \"But Asian Americans are often hidden, in the dark, and there's this idea that we're smart and work hard and we don't need any help. \n\"There's this perception of us as prim and proper and perfect. We seem to be doing fine, but really that's because we are working so damn hard.\" \nThe model minority idea, she noted, is not only damaging to Asians it also minimizes the very real problems faced by Black and brown Americans, making others think they should overcome obstacles as well as Asians do, without understanding the differences in their histories, and the kinds of racism they encounter: \nIs Atlanta a tipping point? \nKim pointed to \"this moment of mourning\" for the victims of the Atlanta shootings and initial news of the shootings, which first characterized the shooter's sex addiction as a motive, drawing a strong backlash as an event that brought the problem of anti-Asian hate to light. \n— \nIn a February address to the nation to acknowledge the loss of 500,000 Americans to COVID-19, President Joe Biden urged an end to attacks on Asian Americans, Kim noted. The President and Vice President Kamala Harris met with Asian American leaders in Atlanta on March 19. \n\"People have told me they finally feel heard and seen,\" said Kim. \"The question now is, is it going to be sustained, even after this tragedy falls out of the spotlight? Is this something durable that can lead to change? Many of us have been calling for that for at least a year.\" \n\"What bothers me about Atlanta is blaming a hate crime on a sex addiction, which this is clearly not,\" said Gao. \"This was obviously targeting Asian women.\" \nJinwei Cao recalled an incident in June, when apartment residents in Newark, Delaware, found fliers that said \"Kill Chinese virus\" at their doors. \nThe incident rattled students at the University of Delaware, where Cao teaches. While she was satisfied with the police and university responses to the fliers, she said \"it was really unacceptable.\" \n\"The Atlanta shootings, I heard from so many friends and students who felt like this is a breaking point,\" said Gao. \n\"It's threatening our very existence in this country.\" \nStepping up and weighing next steps \nEdward Wang said he's been in conference calls with other Asian American groups nationwide. \nThere is talk of a national march, like the Black Lives Matter marches that took place in the wake of the George Floyd killing in May. \nHe's hoping more attention - from politicians, policymakers, media and will lead to more knowledge of the struggles of Asian Americans, as well as a greater educators appreciation of their many different cultures, histories and contributions.\nAsian Americans, like so many other Americans, have stepped up to help in myriad ways during the pandemic. \n\"There are so many Asian Americans on the front lines,\" said Kim. \"Like the very large community of Filipino American nurses. Doctors. Small business owners.\" \nThe Asian American Alliance of South Jersey has organized food giveaways and collected donations for personal protective equipment to hospitals and first responders, its members said. They've delivered meals to local police departments and helped furloughed workers. \nXiaoping Ma, a physician who lives in Cherry Hill, heard alarming news from her native Wuhan, China, as the virus began to spread there. She recalls being among the first to always wear a face mask, warning others to do the same, and hearing the fear and desperation from friends, family and medical school classmates there. \nShe helped organize donation drives through the Chinese American Physicians Association, connected with colleagues in Wuhan as they learned more about how to contain the virus, sharing information and insight all while dealing with her own fear for family members and fellow medical professionals here and in Wuhan. \n― \nMa, who has been in the United States since 1989 and has been a citizen since the 1990s, said she felt guilty that Wuhan was the place where the virus originated - but angry at the way it was characterized here. \n\"When the previous president called it 'the China virus,' the 'Wuhan virus,' it made me so angry, so afraid. How can an American president be so uneducated and say those things? But I tried to stay anchored on my work.\" \n\"We want people to know we are part of the community,\" said Gao. \n\"I see a lot of hope; a lot of people have reached out\" to show support, said Sharon Xiaoyun Hou. She's received support from the University of Pennsylvania, where she works. \"People checked in on me to see if I was\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
