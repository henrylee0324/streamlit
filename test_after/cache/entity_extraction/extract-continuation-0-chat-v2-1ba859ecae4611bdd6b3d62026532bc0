An international team of researchers from the United States, China, Italy, Germany, Cyprus and Iran, led by assistant professor Gianluca Stringhini, sifted large-scale data sets from Twitter and the alt-right fringe network 4chan's Politically Incorrect board, called /pol/, from Nov 1, 2019 through March 22 last year. \nAccording to an article on the university website: \"They reported an explosion of Sinophobia - anti-Chinese slurs, threats and conspiracy theories as the pandemic spread from China to other countries. \n\"Researchers tracked a shift on Twitter to posts blaming China for the pandemic, while on /pol/, known for polarising hate speech and where people can post anonymously, the shift was toward the use of more and new Sinophobic slurs.\" \nThe report added: \"In April 2020, Stringhini and the other researchers issued their findings in a preliminary e-preprint as 'a call to action', warning that the online anti- Asian rhetoric evolving around the pandemic could possibly lead to hate attacks in the real world and most certainly harm international relations\". \nThey were right, and the Asian-American community is today living with the reality of attacks. \nThis is a chilling reminder that a climate of hate speech online creates an environment that validates sentiments of hate that can eventually escalate to acts of violence. \nMany Singaporeans have noticed a rise in race-fuelled xenophobic comment against Indian nationals online. While Singaporeans tend to draw a line between Singapore Indians and India Indians, as though negativity against non-citizens is acceptable, prejudicial and scapegoating views of any community are just wrong. It requires effort to police ourselves from racist or xenophobic behaviour. \nWe must remember that there are real-life consequences to racist and xenophobic comment. \nTRIBAL INSTINCTS AND GENERATIONAL SHIFTS \nThe third C that explains the heightened race awareness springs from a contest or even clash of viewpoints on race. \nOn one side are those who say the long-established way of managing race relations has delivered racial harmony for decades and should continue. This includes using strong laws and social norms to maintain peace, and emphasising harmony while keeping disagreements and heated discussions behind closed doors. \nBut younger Singaporeans want more candid dialogue and more recognition of latent racism. Perhaps influenced by ideas originating from the West about social justice and critical race theory (the idea that racism is not just about personal prejudice but is embedded and perpetuated by systems and policies), they want to probe race issues even if this provokes discomfort among older Singaporeans. An increasing number also point out how the Government's own pronouncements and policies accentuate racial differences, such as the statement that Singapore is not ready for a non-Chinese prime minister, or the way self-help groups are organised by race. \nAlluding to the generational divide, Leader of the Opposition and Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh wrote on his Facebook page: \"Tectonic shifts are taking place with regard to societal norms in Singapore. And in my estimation, this is being felt most strongly between younger and older Singaporeans. There will continue to be episodes of divergent cultural and generational norms.\" \nOpenness to hearing the lived experiences of our minority communities is the beginning of genuine understanding and integration. \nWhile most people do not see themselves as racist, racism is part of the human experience. \nEvolutionary psychology has taught us that humans have a tendency to view people through a tribal lens. The human brain is said to be capable of forming close ties with only about 150 people - recognising and tracking greater numbers impose too great a cognitive load. As a short cut, when interacting with large groups, say in a city, we look out for people who look like us, who are likely to be our kin, to support us. The hunter-gatherer societies from which we are descended hard-wired humans to prefer those who look like us and to view others with suspicion - so the theories go. \nSuch theories explain the prevalence of racism across cultures. But even if correct, they do not excuse bigoted behaviour from modern humans with free will and intelligence, who should know better than to treat others of different skin colour as inferior creatures. \nSingaporeans especially live in a society whose cultural DNA is precisely to overcome instinctual habits of racial affiliation. It is not for nothing that we pledge ourselves, as one united people regardless of race, language or religion. \nIn Singapore, many of us who love our multiracial country, cultures and cuisine, pride ourselves on not being racist. But in our eagerness to assert our multicultural credentials, we may fall into the danger of denial of racism as felt by others. \nWhen we say, for example, that the recent incident is due to an individual's personal or mental health issue, we are guilty of deflecting from the mainstream. We try to minimise the impact of this incident by emphasising its singularity, when in fact it might be the opposite. As Mr Parkash and many other minority commenters have noted, encounters with such racist attitudes are not uncommon. \nI have come to realise over the past year, talking to various people about race and religion, how much being a member of the majority Chinese community can blind me to the daily slights and insults felt by a non-Chinese person. Such obliviousness is not racist, but can\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Boston University is an educational institution where researchers studied hate speech and its implications during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIANLUCA STRINGHINI<|>PERSON<|>Gianluca Stringhini is an assistant professor leading a research team at Boston University focusing on hate speech and social media.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>GEO<|>Singapore is a country experiencing rising racial tensions and online hate speech, particularly against Indian nationals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is the country from which a significant number of arrivals have been associated with imported COVID-19 cases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased hate speech and xenophobia, particularly against Asian communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>4CHAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>4chan is an online platform known for polarizing hate speech, where users can post anonymously.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORKERS' PARTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Workers' Party is a political party in Singapore, led by Pritam Singh, which addresses societal norms and race relations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRITAM SINGH<|>PERSON<|>Pritam Singh is the Leader of the Opposition in Singapore and the chief of the Workers' Party, discussing societal norms and race issues.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIANLUCA STRINGHINI<|>BOSTON UNIVERSITY<|>Gianluca Stringhini leads research at Boston University on hate speech and social media.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>INDIA<|>Singapore has seen a rise in hate speech against Indian nationals, particularly during the pandemic.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>SINGAPORE<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated racial tensions and hate speech in Singapore.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>4CHAN<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>4chan has been a platform where hate speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic has proliferated.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRITAM SINGH<|>WORKERS' PARTY<|>Pritam Singh is the leader of the Workers' Party, which addresses issues of race and societal norms in Singapore.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased scrutiny of race relations in Singapore.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
