A video shows the female suspect standing behind the woman. At the right moment, she shoves the Asian woman into a moving vehicle. \nThe victim's only physical injury was a bruised knee, but she told ABC 7 the incident left her traumatized. A few days after she began questioning what had happened to her. \n\"I started having self-doubts,\" she told ABC 7. \"I didn't go to work for a couple days. I started thinking too much, like over thinking, replaying the scenario. And I thought to myself, did I see her somewhere before, down the street, did I bump into her? Did I cut her off at the stop light and I just didn't know? All that was getting in my head.\" \nThe victim isn't sure why she was assaulted, but she does wonder if being an Asian American in Chinatown may have had an influence. \nAttacks on Asian Americans in New York City have persisted throughout the pandemic. In June, a man punched a 55-year-old Asian woman unprovoked on the sidewalk, NBC News reports.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
