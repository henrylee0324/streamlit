She doesn't expect to maintain the 4.0 GPA she had in high school.\n\"I'm this recluse living in my apartment by herself,\" Zopelis said.\nAU reopened some residence halls this month, but many students had tried to replicate communal living in nearby apartment buildings, houses and even hotels - forming friendships in the process.\nZopelis, who decided over the summer to live on her own, didn't realize she would be missing so much.\n\"It's been kind of tough,\" she said. \"I feel like I'm missing out on a lot, socially.\"\nThe isolation Zopelis and other students are experiencing feels unnatural, said Michael R. Lovell, president of Marquette University in Milwaukee.\n\"College is the most social time of your life,\" Lovell said. \"When you are isolated in a pandemic, it's very, very difficult for students to navigate a time when they do feel pressure and stress.\"\nCounselors at AU have offered services to students including anonymous mental health screenings, virtual workshops and group therapy sessions. But, wary about pursuing counseling, Zopelis is trying to manage the feelings on her own. She adopted a siamese cat named Toby, which she said has helped.\n\"I don't know if I'm going to have a positive experience or not,\" Zopelis said about counseling. \"It's hard to open up about personal issues, especially with someone you don't know.\"\nAn outlet is gone \nBrownell, 19, didn't seek mental health services, either. Dartmouth's counseling center offered resources during the sophomore's 10-day stint in isolation housing, but she said she felt uneasy about discussing her mental health with the school.\nInstead, she relied on phone calls with her girlfriend, friends and family to cope with the mental strain that came with being kept inside for days on end. Brownell doesn't know how she contracted the virus, but there was an outbreak on campus in late February and early March, and she was among those sickened. Then, she was rushed away to isolation, bringing only a backpack and laptop, along with some clothes, toiletries and an essential oils diffuser.\nShe sustained her connection to the outside world through online classes and daily conversations with a campus nurse. Otherwise, there was little to do, so Brownell buried herself in school work.\n\"I felt guilty when I wasn't doing schoolwork in isolation,\" she said, adding that she felt more pressure than normal to excel academically. \"It made me feel inadequate as a student.\"\nBrownell is used to Ivy League expectations but, as an extrovert, relieves that stress by spending time with other people. Suddenly, that outlet was missing. Unable to go outdoors, she saw other people only when she stepped outside her room to retrieve meals from a common area inside the isolation dorm.\nBrownell, who plans to major in government and art history, said she became lost in her thoughts. She was worried about the toll the virus would take on her health and nervous about falling behind in school.\nWhile in isolation, she was battling symptoms - bad headaches and fatigue - as well as looming deadlines and loneliness. The entire ordeal has had lasting effects.\n\"My anxiety about schoolwork is definitely still raised,\" she said.\nThe challenges came amid a particularly challenging year on the Hanover, N.H., campus of about 6,600 students. In November, freshman Beau DuBray died by suicide, the campus newspaper, the Dartmouth, reported. Another first-year student, Connor Tiffany, died \"unexpectedly\" on March 14, school officials said.\n\"It's been rough on everyone,\" Brownell said.\n'It's demoralizing' \nFor Patrick Peralta, a government and politics major at the University of Maryland at College Park, the last 12 months have produced a different type of anxiety - one that can be harder to describe.\nPeralta, who is part of U-Md.'s Asian American Student Union, has monitored the unprovoked attacks against Asians and Asian Americans: A man's face was slashed on a subway train, a woman was mugged and injured near her home, an 84-year-old man was pushed violently and later died.\nThe U-Md. student organization has been vocal on social media about the rise in anti-Asian violence, condemning the attacks and vandalization of Asian-owned businesses. But, the students warned, \"words aren't nearly enough.\"\nThen, a gunman opened fire on three Atlanta-area spas, leaving eight people - six of whom were Asian women - dead.\n\"We're anxious and we're terrified of what's going to happen to us and our families,\" Peralta said. \"We live in this constant state of precarity, and this perpetual state of fear because we don't know what's going to happen to us.\"\nSagar Matharu, another AASU member, said racism and the anxiety that comes with it have been part of his life for as long as he can remember. At his high school in Frederick, Md., Matharu said someone he once called a friend said he was \"dirty\" and accused him of having a disease.\n\"That's something that really crushed my mental health for a very long time,\" said Matharu, who is Indian American. The experience made him feel lonely and betrayed. \"That loneliness translated into anxiety, depression, a whole myriad of mental health consequences.\"\nThe recent spa attacks unearthed the feelings Matharu had in high school. But his community at U-Md. keeps them from becoming overwhelming.\nSeparated by the pandemic, grieving has been relegated to Zoom.\nStudents also are supporting each other through traumatic events\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
