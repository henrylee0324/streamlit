Judy Chu D-Calif., the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said the \"crimes are beyond terrifying but it just brings home to so many Asian Americans that they are fearful of their lives and circumstances\" as they faced both the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise in hate incidents. She said her group of lawmakers met with the Department of Justice to discuss a nationwide rise in hate incidents and \"we are right now determining actions against AAPI hate.\"\nShe called for the passage of legislation to improve hate crime reporting and also for the establishment of a national day to speak out against anti-Asian American hate on March 26.\nAnd Sen. Richard Blumenthal D-Conn. said the killings could spur legislation against hate crimes and for gun control. He is seeking Republican co-sponsors for legislation to create Justice Department grants aimed at improving reporting of hate crimes. \"This latest series of murders in Atlanta reflects a rising surge of hate crimes, particularly now directly against Asian Americans,\" Blumenthal said. \"Americans should be absolutely revolted and outraged but more importantly, do something.\"\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. said in a statement \"answers are urgently needed to determine whether this deadly attack was a hate crime and what can be done to prevent such an act from ever again happening.\" Pelosi added: \"Our entire nation must come together to speak out to Stop Asian Hate.\"\nVice President Kamala Harris, the first Asian American in the role, told reporters Wednesday that the killing \"speaks to a larger issue which is the issue of violence in our country and what we must do to never tolerate it.\"\nStop AAPI Hate, an advocacy group tracking hate incidents, said it had received nearly 3,800 reports of hate incidents across the country since March 2020, compared with roughly 100 incidents annually in previous years. Advocates have sounded the alarm on recent violent attacks against Asian Americans, including the killing of 84-year-old Thai American Vicha Ratanapakdee, and a recent increase in violence against older people across the country.\nCongress was set to debate the issue this week. A House panel will hold a hearing Thursday addressing the rise in anti-Asian American hate and discrimination, its first on the issue since 1987, with testimony from lawmakers and advocates including Chu. An anti-hate crime bill proposed by Chu and other lawmakers is likely to come up during the hearing as lawmakers consider their response to the rise in hate.\nThe shootings could breathe new life into efforts to pass legislation addressing the hate incidents. Asian American lawmakers introduced legislation addressing the issue in the last Congress, but other than the House's passage of a nonbinding resolution condemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic, no legislation was signed into law.\n\"We stand in full and complete solidarity with our Asian American brothers and sisters throughout the country and we will not rest until we stop Asian hate in America,\" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., a member of House Democratic leadership.\nDemocrats have blamed much of the increase in hate incidents on former President Donald Trump, citing his use of derisive terms for the coronavirus. Trump \"clearly stoked the flames of xenophobia against AAPIs with his rhetoric,\" Chu said, and ignored warnings from advocates and lawmakers. The result was the shooting, the latest in a string of racially motivated incidents against Asians nationwide, Chu said.\n\"It's clear the individuals were targeted because they are amongst the vulnerable in our country – immigrant Asian women,\" Chu told reporters.\nLocal police said Wednesday that it was too soon to tell whether the killings at the massage parlors were racially motivated, saying they could have been linked to sex addiction.\nYale University Sociology Department chair Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies, said it was hard to disentangle race from the killings. The shooter had targeted Asian American women and, given how \"Asian American women have been viewed as exotic and feminine objects in U.S. mass media and suspected of prostitution from the earliest U.S. immigration restrictions,\" the suspect could easily have viewed Asian American women in the same manner, she said.\n\"If you talk to the average Asian American woman, most of us have been subject to varying degrees of sexual harassment that targets our gender and racial identities,\" Kao said. \"They do not exist separately in the lives of individuals.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city where a tragic shooting occurred, resulting in the deaths of at least eight people, predominantly Asian American.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUDY CHU<|>PERSON<|>Judy Chu is a U.S. Representative from California and the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, advocating for legislation against AAPI hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHARD BLUMENTHAL<|>PERSON<|>Richard Blumenthal is a U.S. Senator from Connecticut who is seeking legislation to combat hate crimes and improve reporting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NANCY PELOSI<|>PERSON<|>Nancy Pelosi is the House Speaker who called for urgent answers regarding the shooting and the need to prevent such acts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>PERSON<|>Kamala Harris is the Vice President of the United States and the first Asian American in the role, addressing the issue of violence in the country.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an advocacy group that tracks hate incidents against Asian Americans and reported a significant increase in such incidents since March 2020.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old Thai American who was killed in a violent attack, highlighting the rise in violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAKEEM JEFFRIES<|>PERSON<|>Hakeem Jeffries is a U.S. Representative from New York and a member of House Democratic leadership, expressing solidarity with Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States, criticized for his rhetoric that allegedly fueled xenophobia against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yale University is an educational institution where Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies, is affiliated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRACE KAO<|>PERSON<|>Grace Kao is the chair of the Sociology Department at Yale University and an expert on Asian American studies, discussing the implications of the shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AAPI HATE<|>EVENT<|>A national day proposed to speak out against anti-Asian American hate, suggested by lawmakers in response to rising hate incidents.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUDY CHU<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Judy Chu is advocating for actions against AAPI hate, aligning with the mission of Stop AAPI Hate<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICHARD BLUMENTHAL<|>AAPI HATE<|>Richard Blumenthal is seeking legislation to combat hate crimes, which is a central concern of the AAPI Hate movement<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANCY PELOSI<|>AAPI HATE<|>Nancy Pelosi is calling for urgent action to address hate crimes, which is a key focus of the AAPI Hate initiative<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>AAPI HATE<|>Kamala Harris is addressing the broader issue of violence in the country, which includes the context of AAPI hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>The killing of Vicha Ratanapakdee is an example of the hate incidents that Stop AAPI Hate tracks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAKEEM JEFFRIES<|>AAPI HATE<|>Hakeem Jeffries expresses solidarity with the Asian American community, which is affected by AAPI hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>JUDY CHU<|>Judy Chu blames Donald Trump's rhetoric for increasing hate incidents against Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRACE KAO<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>Grace Kao discusses the implications of the killings, including the case of Vicha Ratanapakdee<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUDY CHU<|>RICHARD BLUMENTHAL<|>Both Judy Chu and Richard Blumenthal are advocating for legislation to combat hate crimes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANCY PELOSI<|>RICHARD BLUMENTHAL<|>Nancy Pelosi and Richard Blumenthal are both involved in legislative efforts to address hate crimes<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
