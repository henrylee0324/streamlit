It was also an Asian American scientist who\ndiscovered the cure for the Ebola virus and is busy at work on potential cure for COVID-19.\nAsian Americans are typically soft-spoken and humble to a fault. The many thousands of Asian\nmedical professionals will never flaunt their own personal sacrifices as front-liners and willing\nwarriors in the war against the deadly Coronavirus. Asian business and technical professionals\nsuch as\nengineers, scientists, architects, accountants, educators and others are low-keyed as they lead the\ntechnology revolution in the country.\nThey should all be applauded and thanked, instead of being shunned and\nmistreated by clueless and ungrateful segments of our society. And it is wrong to curb the\nimmigration into this country of these skilled and talented professionals. America must continue to\nbe open to Asian immigration, especially the highly-skilled professionals. America and all of us will\nbe better for it.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
