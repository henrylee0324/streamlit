It can be an agonizing calibration just to take a walk: Will wearing a mask act as a shield or attract unwanted attention? Is daytime safer than night? Are largely Asian neighborhoods safer or more likely to be attacked?Many residents have also called on the police to increase patrols and some communities have started their own neighborhood watches.Some Asian Americans said they were heartened by a new federal law that seeks to strengthen the law enforcement response to a nearly 150 percent increase in anti-Asian attacks, many of them aimed against women and older people.Still, many remain fearful. \"When society is more open that means more threats\" said Jeff Le, a political partner at the Truman National Security Project, a think tank.Mr. Le has returned to much of his prepandemic life but said he is still anxious about getting back on a plane since the day in March 2020 when a woman at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport spit on him and said \"Go back to where you came from.\"\"It was a feeling of helplessness like I'd never felt before\" Mr. Le said. \"That's something I can't shake. It made me feel like I was a cancer or something radioactive.\"Even as Americans poured back onto planes over Memorial Day, the thought of flying again made Mr. Le queasy. He has visited 85 countries and used to travel constantly for work but has been grounded since last year. \"I'm a little more nervous about it than I'd thought\" he said.Cathie Lieu Yasuda said she felt safe walking through her hometown Folsom, Calif., but said it was still too risky to take her ninth-grade daughter and fifth-grade son to a Giants baseball game. Whenever she and her children go out, they follow a new rule of social distancing: Not six feet to stop the spread but arm's length to keep from getting shoved or punched.\"The sidewalk is big enough\" Ms. Lieu Yasuda said. \"We're not afraid. We're not cowering. We're being safe.\"After getting vaccinated, Augustine Tsui is again commuting from New Jersey to his law-firm job in Midtown Manhattan but he said he does not know when his life or commute will ever feel normal. After years of taking the bus and train, he now drives to work and pays as much as $65 in parking, the price of easing his family's worries. His wife Casey Sun stays at home making organic soaps and cosmetics for her online business and said she rarely leaves the house.Mr. Tsui's office is not far from where an attacker bit off part of an Asian man's finger in mid-May. Mr. Tsui wears a mask to conceal his face as he hustles inside.\"Instead of getting anti-Asian comments it's not entirely clear who I am\" he said. \"I can just go about my day.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
