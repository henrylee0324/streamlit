people in shootings at Atlanta massage parlours may have\nbeen impelled by \"sex addiction\", officials said on Wednesday although six of the victims were of Asian descent.\nA 21-year-old White man, Robert Aaron Long, is in custody and he has admitted to carrying out the Tuesday\nevening shooting at three locations, officials said.\nThe killings of people of Asian descent came as the country was being swept by a wave of violence against\nthem.\nBut Sheriff's Office Captain Jay Baker said at a news conference on Wednesday that two of the victims were\nWhite and that Long \"does claim that it was not racially motivated\".\nSheriff Frank Reynolds said Long \"made indicators that he has some issues, potentially sexual addiction, and\nmay have frequented some of these places in the past\".\nBaker added that Long told them he considered the spas \"as an outlet for him\" to do \"something he shouldn't be\ndoing\" and that he wanted \"to take out that temptation\".\nSeven of those killed were women and the South Korean Foreign Ministry said that four of them were of Korean\ndescent.\nAt least one person was also injured in the attack.\nAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said: \"Whether it's senseless violence that we've seen play out in our\nstreets, or more targeted violence like we saw yesterday, a crime against any community is a crime against us\nall.\"\nFears persisted in the Asian community that they were targeted because of the spate of violence against them.\nVice President Kamala Harris said: \"Knowing the increasing level of hate crime against our Asian American\nbrothers and sisters, we also want to speak out in solidarity with them and acknowledge that none of us should\never be silent in the face of any form of hate.\"\nAn organisation, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US, has said that 3,800 cases of violence and\nharassment have taken place in the past year.\nDemocrats and Asian activists have blamed former President Donald Trump for the violence because of repeated\nassertions calling Covid-19 the \"Kungflu\" and an \"Asian virus\", leading some people to blame Asians in the US\nfor the pandemic.\nOfficials said that after images of Long were circulated, his family identified him and alerted them enabling them\nto track him using his mobile phone.\nHe was captured without incident about 240 km away. Officials said that he was on his way Floriday and may\nhave been planning to attack a \"porn\" business.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
