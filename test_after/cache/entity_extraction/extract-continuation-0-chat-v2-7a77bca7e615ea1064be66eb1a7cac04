(Photo by Dan Tian/Xinhua)\"It was just something we grew up with,\" Meng, who is now in her 40s, was quoted by USA TODAY as saying. \"We were taught to mind our own business, not to rock the boat. But what's changed for my generation -- even before the tragedy in Atlanta -- is that people like me were starting to see people who look like their fathers and mothers and grandfathers getting beaten up. That really struck a nerve.\"Frank Wu, president of Queens College, City University of New York, compared the moment to the mood following the 1982 killing in Detroit of Vincent Chin, a Chinese American mistaken for Japanese by two struggling auto workers who beat him to death with a baseball bat. The two were eventually fined 3,000 U.S. dollars and sentenced to probation.\"Out of this tragedy,\" he was quoted by local media as saying, \"there is something I always hoped for but hadn't seen until now: real bridge-building intentions. We just need to follow through.\"Photo taken on Jan. 20, 2021 shows the White House in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)ACTIONS MULLEDAnti-Asian sentiment has grown significantly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many in the community citing the disparaging rhetoric of the Trump administration as a factor.San Francisco-based Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks discrimination and xenophobia against AAPIs, tallied nearly 3,800 such incidents from March 2020 through February 2021.More recently, results of an annual survey conducted by the Anti-Defamation League showed that Asian Americans had suffered the largest spike in severe incidents of hate and harassment online. These figures and estimates give a clear explanation why the current \"StopAsianHate\" marches and demonstrations has been so strong and wide-ranging.\"It's really important and meaningful that we have had such widespread support from all over the country,\" said Grace Meng. \"As an Asian American born and raised here, I have never felt that in my entire life. We need to make the most of this moment.\"Among the long-term solutions, Meng said what she'd like to see is for Americans to better understand each others' histories and contributions, with public education being one way to do that.People walk across a street backdropped by the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States, on March 10, 2021. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)U.S. House Representative Judy Chu of California was among those pushing two hate-related bills for Congressional approval, the No Hate Act and the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, both aiming to improve tracking of hate crimes.\"These are things that should have been improved a long time ago,\" said Chu, noting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation relied on individual states to submit their hate-crime data, \"which means that many don't report anything. Eighteen states don't have a mandate, and three states don't even have a hate crime statute. We need to have change there on a national basis.\"Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth threatened on Tuesday to vote against white nominees to U.S. President Joe Biden's administration until more Asian Americans were appointed to high-ranking roles, then withdrew that threat after she received assurances that the White House would do better. Besides Vice President Kamala Harris of Indian descent, there are no Cabinet secretaries of AAPI descent in Biden's administration despite the president's pledge to reflect the nation's diversity.In related developments, Biden and Harris had met with Georgia state legislators and AAPI advocates to listen to their perspectives on the rise in hate incidents targeting Asian Americans.Earlier, the president urged Congress to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, saying the bill \"would expedite the federal government's response to the rise of hate crimes exacerbated during the pandemic.\" In addition, after the Atlanta killings, Biden's administration is also under pressure to take action on gun control via executive orders.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GRACE MENG<|>PERSON<|>Grace Meng is a U.S. House Representative from New York who has spoken out against anti-Asian hate and advocated for better understanding of Asian American history and contributions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANK WU<|>PERSON<|>Frank Wu is the president of Queens College, City University of New York, who commented on the rise of anti-Asian sentiment and the need for bridge-building.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization based in San Francisco that tracks discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. CAPITOL<|>GEO<|>The U.S. Capitol is the meeting place of the United States Congress, located in Washington, D.C.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act is a legislative proposal aimed at improving the tracking of hate crimes against Asian Americans, introduced in response to rising incidents during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NO HATE ACT<|>EVENT<|>The No Hate Act is a legislative proposal aimed at enhancing the reporting and tracking of hate crimes in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMMY DUCKWORTH<|>PERSON<|>Tammy Duckworth is an Illinois Senator who advocated for the appointment of more Asian Americans to high-ranking roles in the Biden administration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the U.S. President who has urged Congress to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and has met with AAPI advocates.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>PERSON<|>Kamala Harris is the Vice President of the United States, of Indian descent, and is part of the Biden administration.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRACE MENG<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Grace Meng has spoken in support of Stop AAPI Hate and its mission to track discrimination against AAPIs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK WU<|>GRACE MENG<|>Frank Wu commented on the sentiments expressed by Grace Meng regarding anti-Asian hate<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAMMY DUCKWORTH<|>JOE BIDEN<|>Tammy Duckworth expressed concerns to Joe Biden about the representation of Asian Americans in his administration<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>Joe Biden urged Congress to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to address rising hate crimes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>NO HATE ACT<|>Joe Biden supports the No Hate Act as part of efforts to combat hate crimes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRACE MENG<|>NO HATE ACT<|>Grace Meng is advocating for the No Hate Act to improve tracking of hate crimes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>JOE BIDEN<|>Kamala Harris is part of the Biden administration, which is addressing issues of hate crimes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK WU<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>Frank Wu's comments relate to the context of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and its implications<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
