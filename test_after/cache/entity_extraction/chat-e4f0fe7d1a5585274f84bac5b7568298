About a third received more than five hours a day, about a third were offered three to four hours per day, and about a third got two hours or less.\nThose figures surprised Peggy Carr, associate commissioner at the National Center for Education Statistics. \n\"I knew it was going to be low but not quite that low,\" she said.\nScant live instruction was most common in the Midwest and in towns, and less common in the Northeast and in cities.\nBut Carr said she was encouraged by the number of schools that were open for at least some in-person learning in January. A number of districts have reopened since then, so the current total is likely to be higher. The Education Department plans to report results from the same set of schools once a month. \nThroughout the pandemic, educators have talked about a need to prioritize certain students for in-person instruction. The survey found for fourth grade, 44 percent of schools prioritized students with disabilities, with about 1 in 4 prioritizing English language learners, students with lower grades, students without Internet access at home and students experiencing homelessness. Those percentages were higher across the board for eighth grade.\nNonetheless, the survey found that children with disabilities and those learning English attended in-person school at similar rates to other students.\nThe survey was conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the federal Institute for Education Sciences. It included 3,500 schools serving fourth-graders and 3,500 schools serving eighth-graders.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
