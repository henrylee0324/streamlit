A quarter of\nthe incidents took place on public streets, while a third of the incidents occurred at businesses.\n\"I think the (COVID-19) pandemic and, the discrimination that we've seen, has been pouring gasoline on the fire over the\nlast year,\" Kim said. \"It's disturbing and I truly also believe that these numbers do not reflect the totality of what is going\non.\"\nCOVID-19's impact\nAsian history experts say the issue of harassment is nothing new for the Asian community, as a majority have dealt with\ndiscrimination for decades. But there have been several high-profile incidents, such as the recent shootings in Atlanta-area\nspas on March 16, in which six of the eight victims were Asian women, that have played a large part in highlighting the\nissue.\nLast March, a New York City man attacked a 65-year-old Asian American woman in broad daylight and hurled anti-Asian\ninsults at her as she walked down a midtown Manhattan street, according to New York City police.\nThe woman was later hospitalized with serious injuries after the attacker punched, kicked and stomped on her as staff and\nbystanders did not intervene the incident. NYPD called the incident \"a hate crime assault,\" which later prompted a large\noutcry amongst the Asian community for justice and change.\nEarlier this month, Jonathan Russo, 27, was charged with multiple counts of assault and harassment, both as a hate crime,\nin connection with pushing a 64-year-old Asian American woman on a sidewalk and knocking her down in New York,\nassaulting a 32-year-old Asian American woman by grabbing her hair, and shoving a 77-year-old Asian American man to the\nground.\nRichard Chen, 40, a web producer and a board member for the Asian American Action Fund, said anti-Asian discrimination is\nnothing new across the tristate area, saying that even though he would often see people staring at him when the pandemic\nfirst started, he believes many others have had it far worse in years past.\n\"Discrimination toward (Asians) has always been there, especially in New York,\" said Chen, a resident from Branchburg in\nSomerset County. \"Sure, we usually get those typical stares because of where the virus started, but those who have been\nharassed or assaulted because of it is completely unacceptable and is likely going to continue to be honest.\"\nJennifer Ho, a professor of Asian American studies at University Colorado of Boulder and the director of Humanities and Arts,\nsaid this topic is the story of the moment, and that the pandemic has only given people another reason to attack this\ncommunity.\nHo emphasized the recent violent attacks at Asian American seniors and women throughout the first few months of this year,\nspecifically videos that have surfaced across the mainstream media, has likely led to the increase of reports recorded by the\nStop AAPI Hate nonprofit organization.\n\"I want to say that with the violence we're seeing now and with all the racism and the videos that came out last year against\nAfrican Americans, the reports are increasing because of the national attention it is receiving,\" Ho said. \"Prior to this year,\nwhen was the last time you honestly saw this much attention on racism against Asian Americans?\"\nAdditionally, the report released by the AAPI anti-hate organization also showed that Asian women made up 68% of the total\nincidents, compared with men, who made up 29% of all incidents recorded.\nIn the Stop AAPI Hate report, victims of anti-Asian harassment sent in their stories to the organization, which included one\nFilipino American woman reporting that while in a Washington, D.C., metro station with her boyfriend, an unknown man\nshouted at her \"Chinese b----,\" then proceeded to cough at the couple and physically threaten them.\nIt didn't begin with the pandemic\nIn 1871 in Los Angeles, around 500 white and Hispanic people murdered 19 Chinese residents in the so-called Chinese\nmassacre — a buildup of a growing anti-Asian culture that played a part in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned\nthe immigration of Chinese laborers. It was the nation's first set of immigration laws to ban individuals based on race.\nJapan's bombing on Pearl Harbor in 1941 resulted in the internment of most Japanese Americans across the West Coast to\nbarracks and camps in remote areas during World War II, with the federal government deeming them a possibly disloyal\nsecurity risk. Over 127,000 Japanese Americans were placed in camps in the United States during the war and over 1,800\ndied in the camps.\nJason Oliver-Chang, a professor at the University of Connecticut whose research focuses on Asian American studies and\nAmerican immigration history, said Asian Americans were used as a racial wedge after World War II and the Vietnam War.\n\"Japanese Americans were used as a racial wedge in the '40s and '50s, as with an American allied victory in World War II,\nthere was then a need to claim victory at home as well,\" Oliver-Chang said. \"People at this time were arguing to fight\nfascism abroad and fascism at home and in some respects, people looked to the recovery of Japanese Americans from the\nincarceration experience during World War II, as evidence of the United States overcoming the color line.\"\nOliver-Chang said even\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
