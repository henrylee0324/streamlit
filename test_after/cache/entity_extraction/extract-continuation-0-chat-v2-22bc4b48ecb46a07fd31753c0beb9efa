It took an elderly man in San Francisco to die to get attention. It took six Asian women to die in Atlanta to get people to care.\"Eight people were killed in Tuesday's rampage, six of them Asian women. Though police say the suspect said he did not target them because of their race, the crime touched a nerve in a community already reeling from a yearlong rise in anti-Asian incidents that has spiked in recent months.The crowd in Atlanta gathered near the State Capitol, many holding signs reading \"Stop Asian Hate\" as Ham, among the event's organizers, led them in a chant of \"Stand up fight back!\"Gaby Lynch, 32, carried a piece of cardboard that read \"Does this sign make me look submissive?\"The daughter of a Filipino man and a Korean-Japanese-Irish mother, Lynch said the event was her first rally, and she was heartened to see the community support.\"It feels like home – like we are surrounded by family members,\" said Lynch, who works in wholesaling in Atlanta. \"We need people to know that we are not just silent and quiet.\"Newly elected Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., offered his support to the crowd and promised to use his position to fight discrimination, racism, and gun violence.The tragedy has prompted an outpouring of support as communities nationwide from Phoenix to Philadelphia gathered to mourn the dead. A coalition called the Asian American Leaders Table had compiled a list of such events around the country, some of them planned over the weekend or later this month.Video shows suspect at spaSurveillance video released Friday shows the suspect in the killings leaving the spa where the first shootings are believed to have taken place.The video obtained by the Associated Press shows 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long leaving Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Georgia, 30 minutes north of Atlanta, and getting into his vehicle.Four people were shot to death there and another person wounded. Four others were killed at two other spas in the Atlanta area.Other video footage obtained by the Washington Post indicates Long spent an hour outside Young's before entering the spa. An hour and 12 minutes later, he is seen leaving the location and getting into his car before police arrive, the newspaper said.More details about the suspect have been emerging. Records released to USA TODAY on Friday indicated that Long had been kicked out of his parents' home the day before the shooting and was \"emotional.\"Long also had recently been furloughed from his job at a trade show business because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the report said.Police have said Long had indicated he committed the shootings because of a sex addiction.Spas had been targets of stingsPolice records showed officers had targeted two of the spas numerous times over the past decade in prostitution stings, appearing to contradict Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms' statement last week that aside from a minor potential theft, the businesses had not been a police concern.Federal investigators have not found evidence that clears the high bar for federal hate crime charges against Long, the AP reported, citing two law enforcement officials.Nevertheless, experts have said the killings are inextricably connected to racism and hate. The shootings come during a spike in incidents of hate, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans amid the COVID-19 pandemic fueled by politicians' racist rhetoric, said Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks such incidents. AAPI stands for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.Those killed Tuesday were Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; Yong Ae Yue, 63; Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Daoyou Feng, 44; and Xiaojie Tan, 49, who owned Young's.Outrage across the countryThe events Tuesday began late that afternoon when authorities say Long opened fire at Young's before driving 30 miles into Atlanta and killing four more people at two businesses, Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa. Police believe he was headed to Florida where he meant to target additional spas when he was arrested about 150 miles south of Atlanta.Reverberations from the incident are being felt throughout the country, especially among Asian Americans who feel a sense of vulnerability and are fearful of heading out amid the spike in anti-Asian incidents. In a report released last week before the Atlanta killings, Stop AAPI Hate said it recorded nearly 3,800 anti-Asian incidents – including harassment, discrimination, and acts of violence – from mid-March last year to late February 2021.Kay Kim, a longtime resident of Savannah who attends a local Asian church, said her whole congregation is scared. In conversation, she oscillates between anxiety about the violence and faith that the world is still beautiful.\"It's senseless,\" Kim said. \"It doesn't have to be this way. It's a beautiful America, a blessed country. We shouldn't ruin it with these kinds of acts.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in Georgia where a rally was held in support of the Asian American community following recent violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is the U.S. state where the killings occurred and where the rally took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>PERSON<|>Hyun Jung Grant was a victim of the shootings in Georgia, and a GoFundMe account was set up for her sons.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILL LEX HAM<|>PERSON<|>Will Lex Ham is a New York City-based actor and one of the organizers of the rally in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GABY LYNCH<|>PERSON<|>Gaby Lynch is a participant in the rally who expressed her feelings of community support.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAPHAEL WARNOCK<|>PERSON<|>Raphael Warnock is a newly elected senator from Georgia who supported the rally and promised to fight discrimination and racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN MASSAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Young's Asian Massage is the spa where the first shootings occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLD SPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gold Spa is one of the locations in Atlanta where additional shootings took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AROMATHERAPY SPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Aromatherapy Spa is another location in Atlanta where shootings occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a group that tracks incidents of hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIX ASIAN WOMEN<|>EVENT<|>The six Asian women who were killed in the shootings in Atlanta, which sparked outrage and protests.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EIGHT PEOPLE<|>EVENT<|>The total number of victims killed in the shootings, which included six Asian women.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILL LEX HAM<|>ATLANTA<|>Will Lex Ham spoke at the rally in Atlanta to support the Asian American community<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>GOLD SPA<|>Hyun Jung Grant was one of the victims of the shootings that occurred at Gold Spa<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>YOUNG'S ASIAN MASSAGE<|>Hyun Jung Grant was a victim of the shootings that took place at Young's Asian Massage<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYUN JUNG GRANT<|>AROMATHERAPY SPA<|>Hyun Jung Grant was a victim of the shootings that occurred at Aromatherapy Spa<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAPHAEL WARNOCK<|>ATLANTA<|>Raphael Warnock attended the rally in Atlanta to show support for the victims and the community<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GABY LYNCH<|>ATLANTA<|>Gaby Lynch participated in the rally in Atlanta, expressing her feelings of community support<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>SIX ASIAN WOMEN<|>Stop AAPI Hate tracks incidents of violence against Asian Americans, including the killings of the six Asian women<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>EIGHT PEOPLE<|>Stop AAPI Hate tracks incidents of violence against Asian Americans, including the total of eight victims<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILL LEX HAM<|>SIX ASIAN WOMEN<|>Will Lex Ham spoke about the violence against the six Asian women who were killed<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILL LEX HAM<|>EIGHT PEOPLE<|>Will Lex Ham addressed the crowd regarding the eight victims of the shootings<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
