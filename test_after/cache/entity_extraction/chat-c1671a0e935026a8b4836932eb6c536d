Obstacles to filing reports include fear of retaliation and victims not believing that will make a difference, she said.\nNationally, more than 3,800 incidents of racism and xenophobia against Asians and Pacific Islanders were recorded between March 2020 and February by Stop AAPI Hate, a San Francisco-based reporting center.\nThe majority of discrimination reported involved verbal harassment and shunning, according to a Stop AAPI Hate report, which found that discrimination mostly occurred at businesses, followed by public streets.\nFurther, the report indicates, women reported hate incidents 2.3 times more than men.\n'The solidarity shown\nhas been beautiful'\nDespite the terror and grief, Yusef said that, in Des Moines, the \"solidarity shown has been beautiful\" in response to the Atlanta killings and increased concerns about racism and xenophobia against Asians and Pacific Islanders.\nApart from the community reaching out and checking in on her, Yusef said her organization, Monsoon Asians and Pacific Islanders, has received many donations, which she plans to send directly to the victims' families and coworkers.\nOrganizations such as the NAACP of Des Moines have released statements in solidarity, as well.\nAdditionally, Huynh has said she's seen a lot of solidarity both in business partnerships and in rallying the community to support Asian and Pacific Islander businesses in Iowa.\nLucky Lotus, which serves Laotian, Vietnamese and Chinese specialties in Des Moines' Woodland Heights neighborhood, announced Thursday morning that the restaurant plans to donate 25% of its proceeds through the end of the week to the Iowa Asian Alliance.\n\"We lead with love and kindness, but we cannot stay silent. Uniting Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander communities to foster growth and development will lead to a more vibrant and prosperous community, which we believe will in turn help prevent violent acts of hate from corrupting the most vulnerable in our neighborhoods,\" the restaurant wrote in a statement.\nAnd on Saturday, the community will come together for a vigil from noon to 4 p.m. at the Pappajohn Sculpture Park to remember the lives of the eight killed in Atlanta, as well as to pay respect to other Asians and Pacific Islanders who have experienced racism and xenophobia.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
