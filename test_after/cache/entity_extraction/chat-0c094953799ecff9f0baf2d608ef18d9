It is unacceptable, it is hateful, and it has to stop.\"\nWhether the killer's motive was racism or xenophobia, misogyny or religious guilt about his sexuality, Asian advocacy groups stressed that no one should ignore the broader context of a recent surge of hate crimes and harassment targeting Asian Americans.\n\"That the Asian women murdered yesterday were working highly vulnerable and low-wage jobs during an ongoing pandemic speaks directly to the compounding impacts of misogyny, structural violence and white supremacy,\" Phi Nguyen, litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, said in a statement.\nCherokee County Sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker said at a news conference that the spas appeared to be \"a temptation\" for Long that \"he wanted to eliminate.\"\n\"These locations, he sees them as an outlet for him -- something that he shouldn't be doing, an issue with porn -- and that he was attempting to take out that temptation,\" Baker said.\nAuthorities told reporters that Long, who is from Woodstock, Ga., had been heading south with plans to carry out similar attacks in Florida.\n\"He was pretty much fed up and at the end of his rope,\" Baker said in comments that struck many as oddly sympathetic to a suspected killer. \"Yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did.\"\nAfter the news conference, Baker drew ire as critics noted that he appeared to endorse anti-China statements last year as he shared an image of T-shirts that echoed then-President Trump's rhetoric, referring to COVID-19 as an \"imported virus from Chy-na.\"\n\"Love my shirt,\" Baker wrote in a Facebook post. \"Get yours while they last.'\"\nOn Wednesday, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office released the names of three women and one man killed in the first shooting: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Yan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44.\nThe Atlanta Police Department said the victims in the two incidents that occurred within the city had yet to be positively identified, and next of kin notification had not been confirmed by the Fulton County medical examiner.\nSouth Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday that its diplomats in Atlanta have confirmed with police that four of the dead were women of Korean descent.\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that President Biden had been briefed on the \"horrific shootings\" and that administration officials had been in contact with the Atlanta mayor's office and the FBI.\nOn Wednesday morning, Long was transported to the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center.\nA 2017 graduate of Sequoyah High School in Canton, Ga., Long was described by one of his fellow students, Nicolas Straughan, as quiet, solitary and religious.\n\"He didn't say too much,\" Straughan recalled.\nRaised as a devout Southern Baptist, Long attended services at Crabapple First Baptist Church. According to minutes taken during a Jan. 21, 2018, meeting, he was among 11 people who served on the church's Student Ministry Team.\nThe mission of that group, the document said, was to \"see students receive Jesus Christ as Lord, and walk in Him, being rooted in the faith.\"\nOn Wednesday morning, the church's website and Facebook page were no longer publicly accessible. Its pastor did not respond to requests for comment.\nOn Instagram, Long described his interests as \"pizza, guns, drums, music, family, and God,\" the Daily Beast reported.\nThe attacks began about 5 p.m. Tuesday, when five people were shot at Young's Asian Massage in a strip mall in Acworth, about 25 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta, authorities said. Four people died and one person was injured.\nNo one was apprehended at the scene, but surveillance videos captured a suspect and a 2007 black Hyundai Tucson.\nLess than 50 minutes later, Atlanta police officers responded to a report of a robbery about 25 miles south at Gold Spa in northeast Atlanta, where they found three women who had been fatally shot. As the officers responded to the scene, they received a report of shots fired at Aromatherapy Spa across the street. Inside that business, they found the body of another woman who had been shot.\nAt 8 p.m., Reynolds alerted the highway patrol and the Crisp County Sheriff's Office, about 150 miles south, that the suspect was headed south on Interstate 75.\nThe Hyundai was spotted about 8:30, and a state trooper performed a maneuver that caused the vehicle to spin out of control, Crisp County Sheriff Billy Hancock said. Long was taken into custody and transported to the Crisp County jail.\nWith fear spreading across spas in the city, Atlanta police upped patrols Tuesday night in the area where the killings took place and dispatched officers to check on similar businesses nearby.\nOn Wednesday, a throng of media gathered outside Gold Spa and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
