But in the wake of the recent Asian- hate crimes, I can't stop thinking about the children of the victims -- many of whom are multiracial, born in America and rarely considered in conversations about racism. \nThe challenges we face are growing, not going away. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center study, nearly half of all multiracial Americans were under 18 years old. A whole generation of children are experiencing racism this nation does not see, and even their parents cannot relate to. \nBut I can. A few weeks ago, I was excitedly, nervously talking with my friends about the fact that in just a year we'll have our driver's licenses. Then a boy on the other side of the cafeteria shouted at me: \"How are you going to see the road through those eyes?\" I told him it wasn't funny. I told him it was racist. But after that moment, I felt utterly alone. That's the experience of being a multiracial kid in America. \nWhen I came home that day, my Jewish mom tried to comfort and relate to me, saying she had been bullied for being chubby as a teenager. I love my mom, but at that moment, I wished my Chinese dad was there. Even though he died when I was only 7, I thought that by seeing his face I would like the slenderness of my eyes, the flatness of my nose and the softness of my jawline. My looks are deceiving, just as the experience of being a multiracial kid in America is deceptively lonely. Looking back, I realize that even if my parents had both been there, they could not have changed the inadequacy I felt because neither of them is multiracial. \nMy favorite author, Peter Ho Davies, writes that a Chinese-American biracial individual's experience is not that of the two identities on either side of the hyphen; instead, it is the hyphen itself. \"In their various ways, they feel themselves to be insufficiently Chinese or insufficiently American. That's a tragedy if you think the choice is either/or. But I'd argue that there's a third alternative, that's equally authentic.\" \nMy third alternative has Chinese food on Rosh Hashana and matzo-ball-wonton soup at Thanksgiving. And even still, I feel eternal guilt that I didn't go to Chinese school but was committed to hearing Torah stories at Sunday school. That I crave to learn about my Chinese ancestry but feel content with the knowledge I have of my Jewish side. That I felt closer to my bubbe than my nai nai. \nMultiracial people have long faced discrimination in this country. From the time of slavery, through Jim Crow and even today, light-skinned Black people have experienced a tension between a pressure to \"pass\" as white (intentionally or not) and to embrace their Black identity -- an accusation Vice President Kamala Harris experienced on both sides of the partisan aisle this past election. A recent study even showed that monoracial people believe mixed people to be more \"cognitively demanding\" than fellow monoracial people. Studies also show that mixed-race people have higher rates of mental health issues and substance abuse. Many endure the hatred of white America while simultaneously grappling with the \"-American\" part of their identity. \nHollywood tries to represent us. One may recall the female lead of the sitcom \"Grown-ish\" and the male lead of the film \"Crazy Rich Asians\" are like me, mixed race. Yet, Hollywood knowingly or unknowingly whitewashes the figures I used to look at and naively see myself in. Importantly, it does so at the expense of honoring the biracial identity and the identity of other minorities. Society looks at me and sees Chinese. Society tells me to check one box. Asian. Two if I'm lucky. Caucasian and Asian. \nSociety must recognize that multiracial people cannot be shoehorned into a single box, nor can they be expected to check all the boxes. It must stop taking one look at me, note my Chinese features, disregard my Jewish insides and decide to hate me. Identity runs much deeper than what's visible on the surface. We must call greater attention to our nation's third alternative, our hyphen. Our identity is complex. It's not binary. It's multilayered. And, it's perfectly imperfectly mixed.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California where two Asian women were beaten and robbed, highlighting issues of anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in Georgia where a shooting incident occurred at a spa, resulting in 8 deaths and raising concerns about anti-Asian bias.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEW RESEARCH CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan American think tank that conducts research and provides data on various social issues, including demographics of multiracial Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETER HO DAVIES<|>PERSON<|>Peter Ho Davies is an author known for his writings on the biracial experience, particularly the complexities of identity for Chinese-American individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>PERSON<|>Kamala Harris is the Vice President of the United States who has faced accusations regarding her racial identity during her political career.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROWN-ISH<|>EVENT<|>Grown-ish is a sitcom that features a biracial female lead, representing the experiences of mixed-race individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAZY RICH ASIANS<|>EVENT<|>Crazy Rich Asians is a film that includes a biracial male lead, contributing to the representation of mixed-race identities in Hollywood.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTIRACIAL AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Multiracial Americans are individuals with mixed racial backgrounds who face unique challenges and discrimination in society.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIM CROW<|>EVENT<|>Jim Crow refers to the state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States, impacting the experiences of multiracial individuals.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>ATLANTA<|>Both cities are locations where significant anti-Asian violence has occurred, highlighting a broader issue of discrimination against Asian communities in America.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEW RESEARCH CENTER<|>MULTIRACIAL AMERICANS<|>The Pew Research Center conducts studies that provide insights into the demographics and experiences of multiracial Americans.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETER HO DAVIES<|>MULTIRACIAL AMERICANS<|>Peter Ho Davies writes about the biracial experience, which resonates with the challenges faced by multiracial Americans.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAMALA HARRIS<|>MULTIRACIAL AMERICANS<|>Kamala Harris's experiences with her racial identity reflect the complexities faced by multiracial individuals in America.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROWN-ISH<|>MULTIRACIAL AMERICANS<|>The sitcom Grown-ish features a biracial character, contributing to the representation of multiracial experiences in media.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAZY RICH ASIANS<|>MULTIRACIAL AMERICANS<|>The film Crazy Rich Asians includes a biracial character, highlighting the representation of mixed-race identities in Hollywood.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JIM CROW<|>MULTIRACIAL AMERICANS<|>The historical context of Jim Crow laws has shaped the experiences of multiracial Americans, particularly in terms of identity and discrimination.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
