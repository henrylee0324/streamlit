So they continue showing no signs of abating.Before the coronavirus pandemic this was not a big problem. Hate crimes against Asians were relatively few and far between. But a huge upswing began just about the time ex-President Donald Trump dubbed the coronavirus plague the “Chinese virus.”Atlanta shootings: Racism clearly drove Atlanta shootings. It also fuels sexual exploitation of Asian women.Around California these crimes have far more than doubled over the last year but no one can put a precise number on them. In San Francisco they have at least tripled. In Los Angeles there have been more than twice as many this year as a year ago. But official numbers are likely far lower than in real life partly because police don’t do much about the attacks.Not even 700-person rallies decrying the attacks like one the other day in San Jose can stop them.The head of a Southern California group called Asian-Americans Advancing Justice told one reporter many such crimes go unreported because of language problems immigrants unable to communicate with police. Plus she said “When victims … come forward having the police say nothing can be done discourages other victims from relying on police.”Some immigrant advocates also say Korean-Americans and other Asian groups are perceiving new bias among police officers perhaps caused by the Trump rhetoric.Keith Ellison and Jonathan Greenblatt: Stand together to fight anti-Asian hate. We all have a stake in a more inclusive America.But the mere presence of cops on street patrol could have stopped one early March assault on an elderly Asian man who was seated in a Nob Hill laundromat in San Francisco when at attacker ambushed him. Police presence probably would have spared the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee an 84-year-old Thai-American beaten to death in broad daylight also in San Francisco.Neither of their assailants has been identified like most others conducting the current spate of attacks.There are also less violent but still threatening incidents. One Asian-American woman stopped at a red light the other day in Fresno and a man in the next car signaled she should roll down her window. When she did he shouted “Get out of my country — that’s an order.” After pausing he reportedly added “I’ll kill you.”All this is a demonstration that even a “model minority” noted for high achievement and founding large and successful businesses of many types can suddenly be targeted especially when national leaders become loose-lipped about their own prejudices.It also shows that not only California but the entire nation needs effective policing to protect minorities who have no way to know when they might be victimized even if their particular ethnic group enjoys generally high public esteem.Because bigots have always picked on those they see as weak this is especially important for elderly and frail individuals.Yes the pandemic appears to have originated in or near the Chinese city of Wuhan. But there is no evidence it was deliberately perpetrated on the world. The claim that it was amounts to a blood libel against Chinese individuals who would have been thousands of miles away even if deeds like this had been done.Because most others have difficulty discerning Asians’ native nationalities simply from their appearance all Asian-Americans are now at serious risk especially if they don’t look strong a la the Los Angeles Angels’ 6-foot 4-inch 210 pound Shohei Otani.Police are their only assured protection from random violence and bigotry when they leave their homes. And the fewer cops on the street the more danger for them. Which is just one reason it makes little sense to defund police as Americans are now discovering.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a state in the United States where city councils are responding to social issues and anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black Lives Matter is a movement advocating for social justice and has influenced city councils to divert police budgets to social action causes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SACRAMENTO<|>GEO<|>Sacramento is a city in California that is experiencing anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN JOSE<|>GEO<|>San Jose is a city in California where rallies against anti-Asian violence have taken place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles is a city in California that has seen a significant increase in anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN LEANDRO<|>GEO<|>San Leandro is a city in California affected by anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Orange County is a region in California where anti-Asian violence is occurring.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city where shootings driven by racism have occurred, highlighting the issue of anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>PERSON<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was an 84-year-old Thai-American who was beaten to death in San Francisco, symbolizing the violence against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEITH ELLISON<|>PERSON<|>Keith Ellison is a public figure advocating against anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JONATHAN GREENBLATT<|>PERSON<|>Jonathan Greenblatt is a public figure advocating against anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WUHAN<|>GEO<|>Wuhan is a city in China where the coronavirus pandemic is believed to have originated.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Black Lives Matter has influenced California city councils to redirect police funding towards social action causes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SACRAMENTO<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Sacramento is a city within California experiencing issues related to anti-Asian violence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN JOSE<|>CALIFORNIA<|>San Jose is a city within California where rallies against anti-Asian violence have occurred<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Los Angeles is a city within California that has seen a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN LEANDRO<|>CALIFORNIA<|>San Leandro is a city within California affected by anti-Asian violence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORANGE COUNTY<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Orange County is a region within California experiencing anti-Asian violence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Atlanta's shootings highlight the broader issue of anti-Asian violence affecting communities, including those in California<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICHA RATANAPAKDEE<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Vicha Ratanapakdee was a victim of anti-Asian violence in San Francisco<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEITH ELLISON<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>Keith Ellison supports the efforts of Black Lives Matter in fighting against hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JONATHAN GREENBLATT<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>Jonathan Greenblatt supports the efforts of Black Lives Matter in fighting against hate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WUHAN<|>ANTI-ASIAN VIOLENCE<|>The pandemic's origin in Wuhan has been misused to fuel anti-Asian sentiment and violence<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
