Today, they both realize the American ideals they once believed in are more dreams than realities. The America they fantasized about, the one they saw in Hollywood movies, doesn't exist.\nThis is an America where, in Cincinnati, owners of a Chinese restaurant say their homes and cars have been egged. Where the restaurant receives calls daily telling them to \"go back to China.\" Where staff must be walked to their cars at night.\nBecause the coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China, more than a third of Americans said they witnessed someone blame Asian people for the pandemic last year.\nTao hasn't been directly confronted with a racist phrase describing the virus, but she's heard of others who have – including kids at school. She does fear one question, though: Where are you from? Because when the answer is Cincinnati, it's usually followed by another question:\nWhere are you really from?\nTo her kids, who are 19 and 14, Cincinnati is the only home they've ever known. Tao doesn't talk to them about the violent attacks against Asian Americans that seem to be happening more frequently across the country than ever before. Stories about a 64-year-old grandmother robbed of cash she withdrew from an ATM to buy Lunar New Year gifts. Stories about a 52-year-old woman being shot in the head with a flare gun. Stories about an 84-year-old man smashed against the pavement during his morning walk.\nTao doesn't talk about how the number of hate crimes reported in America's biggest cities went down last year, according to a study at California State University, but the number of hate crimes reported against Asians rose 149%.\nShe doesn't talk about a national intelligence report that concludes there will be a heightened threat of \"domestic violent extremism\" this year.\nShe doesn't talk about how a group tracking discrimination said it received more than 3,000 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian harassment since the pandemic began – compared to roughly 100 incidents in each previous year.\nTao knows this comes from her own insecurity, because she wants her children to believe they can do anything. Because that's how she was raised. She doesn't want them to feel like victims.\nEven if, sometimes, they are.\nIn Cincinnati, data collected by the police department shows there were fewer crimes against Asian people last year than in at least a decade. But the truth is more complicated than that. And experts say those numbers can be wildly underreported.\nThese days, Tao's own parents worry about her safety. And friends across the world ask why her family moved to America. Tao tries to brush off those fears, especially to her parents. She doesn't want to scare them. But the fear is there, inside her head.\nAnd it comes out in tears when she talks about her sons. Because she worries about their safety, too.\nWhen Tao thinks about the future of our country, this can-do person who prides herself on positivity finds herself wondering something she has never wondered before. Is America really a place of liberty and justice for all?\n\"I have doubt,\" she said.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
