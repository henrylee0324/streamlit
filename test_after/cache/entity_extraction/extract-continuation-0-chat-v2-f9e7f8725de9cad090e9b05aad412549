A law enforcement official said that in the killer's words, his actions were \"not racially motivated\" but caused by his \"sexual addiction.\"\nThat framing, Moy said, was dangerous.\n\"So are you going to investigate whether it's racially motivated or do you already know it's not racially motivated and you're just going to stop there?\" she said in a phone call, voicing concern that investigators seemingly absolved the shooter of bigotry and accused his victims of having ties to sex work without any evidence.\n\"It's demeaning,\" said Moy, the founder and president of the Asian American Alliance, a nonprofit community outreach group based in Virginia Beach. \"For the Asian community to hear that, you know, it's not comforting.\"\nRacism against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders is complex and has remained historically invisible, according to guidance from the Asian American Journalists Association. It includes a long history of hypersexualization of Asian women rooted in Westernized and colonial perceptions of Asia.\nAttacks against people of Asian descent have spiked after the Trump administration repeatedly emphasized China's connection to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nA report released Tuesday - the same day of the attacks - revealed nearly 3,800 hate incidents reported against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders nationwide over the last year, according to the California-based nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate. Women of Asian descent have reported 2.3 times more incidents of violence than men of Asian descent.\nStop AAPI Hate was created to prevent discrimination during the coronavirus pandemic. The group collects data on hate and harassment incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States.\n\"Everybody is emphasizing the shooting, but there are tons and tons of everyday incidents where people are facing harassment and so forth,\" said Professor Deenesh Sohoni, director of the Asian Pacific Islander American studies program at the College of William & Mary.\n\"That everyday thing also needs to be given weight. This is something that is happening regularly during this time period.\"\nProfessor Qiu Jin, the director of Old Dominion University's Institute of Asian Studies, said even before the pandemic, she had been used to slurs, funny looks and laughter from strangers. Now, she fears for her safety every time she leaves home.\n\"My husband kept telling me, 'No, don't go out by yourself. Do not go out by yourself or even drive by yourself,' \" Jin said. \"More people need to be aware that this kind of discrimination against Asian Americans exists in the United States.\"\nJin said she hopes people in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community will grow louder about the racism they endure so people will better understand \"the pain and the suffering of this group.\" She stressed that journalists and politicians have a duty to faithfully tell their stories and avoid inflammatory rhetoric, such as former President Donald Trump's characterization of COVID-19 as \"the China virus.\"\n\"We need to keep raising awareness while at the same time condemning the violence which continues to be directed toward AAPI bodies and bodies of color,\" Luisa Igloria, an ODU professor who specializes in Filipino American literature, wrote in an email.\n\"I'm angry that the Atlanta incident (and others like it in the past) continues to be portrayed in the media as merely a result of the shooter's 'having a bad day;' and as a result of his having some kind of 'sex addiction' (this latter - is practically the same thing as blaming the victims).\"\nAcross Virginia, public officials of Asian descent have denounced the attacks.\n\"My Grandfather often endured discrimination and hate because he was Filipino, even though he served this country in the military. He told me about a time when it was common to see signs that said 'No Dogs or Filipinos,' and I always thought that I would never see this kind of hate in my life,\" Virginia Beach Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler, a Democrat, said in a prepared statement. \"No one should live in fear for who they are, or where they come from.\"\nFormer Williamsburg city council member Benny Zhang - the city's first Asian American elected to office - shared his condolences and condemned xenophobia targeting Asian Americans.\n\"The alarming trends of the rising violence against the Asian Pacific American community has propagated fear and heightened awareness in all corners of our country,\" Zhang wrote in an email. \"We all have a responsibility to make sure our neighbors are safe and to stand together against all forms of injustice.\"\nFormer Newport News council member Rob Coleman echoed those concerns and said he is \"deeply saddened and angered\" by the attacks.\n\"The shootings in Atlanta are a shocking act of gun violence but also appear to be an act of hate,\" Democratic Congressman Bobby Scott tweeted on Wednesday.\n\"While my heart goes out to the victims' loved ones, I join in the chorus of voices standing with the AAPI community. We must condemn hate and bigotry in all forms. #StopAsianHate\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PETULA MOY<|>PERSON<|>Petula Moy is the founder and president of the Asian American Alliance, a nonprofit community outreach group based in Virginia Beach, expressing concern over the framing of the Atlanta shootings and its implications for the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN ALLIANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Asian American Alliance is a nonprofit community outreach group based in Virginia Beach, focused on addressing issues faced by the Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the city where eight people, six of them Asian women, were shot dead in a series of targeted attacks on spas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a California-based nonprofit organization created to prevent discrimination during the coronavirus pandemic, collecting data on hate and harassment incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEENESH SOHONI<|>PERSON<|>Deenesh Sohoni is a professor and director of the Asian Pacific Islander American studies program at the College of William & Mary, advocating for awareness of everyday discrimination faced by the AAPI community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QIU JIN<|>PERSON<|>Qiu Jin is the director of Old Dominion University's Institute of Asian Studies, sharing her experiences of discrimination and advocating for awareness of racism against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUISA IGLORIA<|>PERSON<|>Luisa Igloria is an ODU professor specializing in Filipino American literature, expressing anger over the media portrayal of the Atlanta incident and advocating for awareness and condemnation of violence against AAPI individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KELLY CONVIRS-FOWLER<|>PERSON<|>Kelly Convirs-Fowler is a Virginia Beach delegate of Asian descent who denounced the attacks and shared her grandfather's experiences with discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENNY ZHANG<|>PERSON<|>Benny Zhang is a former Williamsburg city council member and the city's first Asian American elected to office, condemning xenophobia targeting Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROB COLEMAN<|>PERSON<|>Rob Coleman is a former Newport News council member who expressed sadness and anger over the attacks in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOBBY SCOTT<|>PERSON<|>Bobby Scott is a Democratic Congressman who tweeted in support of the AAPI community following the Atlanta shootings, condemning hate and bigotry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is the state where the Atlanta shootings occurred, resulting in the deaths of eight individuals, predominantly Asian women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to a rise in discrimination and violence against Asian Americans, as emphasized by various officials and organizations.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETULA MOY<|>ASIAN AMERICAN ALLIANCE<|>Petula Moy is the founder and president of the Asian American Alliance, which addresses issues faced by the Asian American community<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The Atlanta shootings occurred in the context of rising violence against Asian Americans, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Stop AAPI Hate was created in response to the discrimination faced by Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEENESH SOHONI<|>ASIAN AMERICAN ALLIANCE<|>Deenesh Sohoni advocates for awareness of discrimination faced by the AAPI community, aligning with the mission of the Asian American Alliance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QIU JIN<|>ASIAN AMERICAN ALLIANCE<|>Qiu Jin's experiences with discrimination resonate with the concerns addressed by the Asian American Alliance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUISA IGLORIA<|>ASIAN AMERICAN ALLIANCE<|>Luisa Igloria's advocacy for awareness of violence against AAPI individuals aligns with the mission of the Asian American Alliance<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KELLY CONVIRS-FOWLER<|>ATLANTA<|>Kelly Convirs-Fowler denounced the attacks in Atlanta, reflecting the concerns of the Asian American community<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENNY ZHANG<|>ATLANTA<|>Benny Zhang condemned the xenophobia targeting Asian Americans in the context of the Atlanta shootings<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROB COLEMAN<|>ATLANTA<|>Rob Coleman expressed sadness and anger over the Atlanta shootings, highlighting the impact on the AAPI community<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOBBY SCOTT<|>ATLANTA<|>Bobby Scott tweeted in support of the AAPI community following the Atlanta shootings, condemning hate<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
