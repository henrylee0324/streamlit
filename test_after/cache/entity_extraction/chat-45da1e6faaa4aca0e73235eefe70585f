The latest anti-Asian numbers, as of this April 11, saw 54 anti-Asian hate crimes reported to the NYDP, compared with 12 by that date in 2020 - an increase of 350%. \nLast month, Brandon Elliot, 38, was hit with an assault as a hate crime charge after he was caught on video stomping on Vilma Kari, 65, on a Hell's Kitchen sidewalk. \"F-k you,\" he allegedly told the Filipino woman. \"You don't belong here.\" Video released by police ends with a doorman who witnessed the horrific incident closing his building door and the attacker walking away. \nAcross America's 16 largest cities, reported cases of anti-Asian hate and discrimination surged 145%, while overall hate crimes fell 6%, the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism reported. \nFormer President Donald Trump added fuel to the fire by calling COVID-19 the \"Chinese Virus\" and \"Kung Flu.\" \nIn a dozen recent interviews with prominent members of the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community in fields of film, TV, theater, fashion and music, heartache over the rising tide was undeniable, as was recognition the U.S. has a long history of minimizing anti-Asian discrimination. \nComedian Margaret Cho said last month's slaughter of eight people, including six Asian women, at three Asian spas in metro Atlanta was a \"devastating\" inflection point. \nHere, Cho and the other famous figures share their personal experiences with discrimination and their reactions to the recent spate of bigoted terror. \nDavid Henry Hwang \nPlaywright \n\"A few years ago, I was stabbed in the neck by an unknown assailant around 9 p.m. on my block in Brooklyn. The attacker severed my vertebral artery and I lost one-third of my blood. I managed to walk a few blocks to Brooklyn Hospital, where doctors there saved my life. The NYPD did not label my attack a hate crime, but New York state Assembly member Ron Kim (D-Queens) called a press conference to denounce anti-Asian hate and violence. \n\"The current wave of AAPI attacks is nothing new. Because Asians have always been stereotyped as perpetual foreigners, our well-being has always been a function of America's relationship with Asian nations. The big lie of American racism is that if you do everything right and play by the rules, you will be accepted in this country. But the U.S. throughout its history has consistently betrayed this 'model minority' myth, used by the right wing to drive a wedge between AAPIs and our natural Black, Indigenous and people of color allies. We are painfully reminded once again that white supremacy can never be defeated by accommodation, only through organized opposition and progressive activism.\" \nMargaret Cho \nActress and comedian \n\"For me as an Asian-American artist, comedian, actor, it's really more about noninclusion. It's really about being very invisible within Hollywood, within the media, and it's hard to kind of understand how to even talk about invisibility because it's, like, invisible. It's very weird when you're just excluded from the conversation and you're trying to be in an industry that doesn't see you. It's the most insidious kind of racism because it's this feeling of nonexistence. It combines erasure with \na kind of gaslighting that we don't matter or we don't make any impression. And the truth is, we've made a huge contribution to American life. We've been here since 1849, yet still somehow we are seen as 'other,' or not part of America, so this has to change. \n\"I was a resident of Atlanta for seven years. I know exactly all of those spas and the neighborhoods and the communities. They're very familiar to me. The fact that law enforcement was really bending over backwards to try to humanize the murderer was really disturbing. And not categorizing this as a hate crime is part of the problem. \n\"You don't ask somebody who's committed a hate crime whether or not it's a hate crime. It's not something that's up to their opinion.... It is a hate crime when you're targeting Asian women who you say make you feel a certain way so you're \n--- \ngoing to kill them. Why would he specifically seek out Asian spas, Asian-owned spas, Asian-run spas in three different locations in order to kill Asian women if race isn't a factor? That to me is clearly a hate crime against Asians and Asian women in particular. It has nothing to do with sex addiction. Lots of people are saying these are sex workers. I was a sex worker. I know what sex work is. This to me seems more likeskin care and aestheticians. The women were mostly 50, 60, 70. This was not a typical idea of what people think of as sex workers or Asian sex workers. The framing of this as a crime by a sex addict who wanted to kill sex workers, it's not exactly that. There's a lot of projection happening onto this crime that has to do with the inherent racism that exists in society around Asian \nwomen. \n\"I'm grateful to the hashtags #StopAAPIHate and #StopAsianHate. All of these movements are really important, and they really connect us in way that\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
