A time when America glories in the beauty of the 3,000 cherry trees gifted to us in 1912 by the mayor of Tokyo to celebrate friendship between America and the Japanese people. Last week was also the one-month anniversary of the killing of six Asian women in Atlanta and a vigil was held on the Florida State University Campus. NBC reports there have been 3,800 reported attacks this year on people of Asian descent, up nearly 1,000 from the year before. On Thursday, the U.S. Senate passed an Anti-Asian Hate bill in a 94-1 vote, after hearing testimony from Asian-Americans, including Senator Amy Duckworth, about their own experiences of discriminatory behaviors. The bi-partisan legislation now heads to the Democratic-led House. The recent violence has left Tallahassee Asia Americans unsettled but hopeful. We talked to four about their experiences. \nArtist Yoshiko Murdick worries \nYoshiko Murdick is a sought-after Tallahassee watercolor painter. She is now 70 years old and has lived in the United States since her 20s when, as an exchange student, she fell in love with her English professor. \"Convenient subject,\" she deadpans with gentle humor. \nMurdick is self-deprecating at times, funny, and like many ethnically diverse people who know they are easily identifiable by their physical features and sometimes behaviors, she finds herself with a constant, low-grade anxiety. \n\"I know I act 'funny',\" she says, describing her tendency to still make an honorary bow in greeting or gratitude. \"Old habit.\" But what Murdick says she didn't know was the \"hatred that exists here.\" \nLately, when she walks her cuddly dog, she says she doesn't make eye contact with other walkers any longer. \"I try to avoid looking at other people... maybe they are looking at me.\" \nShe, in fact, has been worried enough to buy a stun gun. \"A friend of mine in New Jersey was also worried. She quit her job in Manhattan. She did not want to ride the subways or go into the city where the old woman was beaten and nobody helped.\" \nMurdick says that she is concerned about those she loves. \"As a first-generation American, we hear, \"Go home!\" But the second-generation people can only answer, \"Where?\" Home is here.\" \nAlthough she believes the politics of the previous four years and identifying the COVID virus as a product of Asia set the stage, Murdick also feels it exposed a lot of attitudes she never had suspected. \nAurora Hansen plans mini Asia fest \nAurora Hansen, of Filipino descent, is a woman whose influence and involvement in the Tallahassee community stretches far and wide. Artistic Director of Tallahassee Community College's Dance Company; Community Liaison for the Asian Student Union at FSU, Past Chair of the Asian Coalition of Tallahassee, are among her many contributions to the city. \nCurrently, she is involved in planning for an Experience Asia Mini Festival, the precursor to the annual large Experience Asia festival held in the fall. \"The Mini Festival, set for May 22, in a downtown park, is much like the big one, with Asian music, performers, and food,\" she says. \"Details will be released soon.\" \nAnd how does Hansen feel about the current racial climate in the country? Does she wonder if now is a good time to put on an Asian festival? \n\"Yes, there are quiet anxieties,\" she says. \"Even here in Tallahassee, I, myself have experienced a 'situation.'\" Hansen says that recently, in Midtown, she was accosted by someone who pushed her and said, \"Get out of my America.\" \nHansen was not cowed, she says, and stood up for herself. But she notes there is often more subtle discrimination, beyond bullying and name-calling. \nShe notes that Asian associations around the country have been meeting to offer one another support and reminders of safe behaviors such as \"having a buddy go with you into parking garages, and being aware of places you may be vulnerable.\" \nPortia Campos is 'horrified and angry' \nHansen is working with Portia Campos, an Assistant Teaching Professor as FSU. Her husband is President of the Big Bend Filipino Association of Tallahassee and she is equally involved in advocacy groups which offer up insights and the ability to experience Asian culture. \n\"I am horrified and angry at the targeting,\" she says, noting that she worries about elderly parents in Jacksonville and an autistic brother. \"I stay home more now and don't go certain places alone.\" \nBut Campos is nevertheless feeling excited about the planned Asian festivals. \"I believe the local authorities are aware, and though I am a little nervous, we have been putting on these festivals for 18 or 19 years, and I feel good about the Tallahassee community.\" \nFSU student Tanvi Marulendra calls for empathy \nTanvi Marulendra, who is of Indian descent, will graduate this year from FSU. She is the Director of the Asian American Student Union. \nWhile she notes there has been no violence on campus, she says racial slurs, and insensitive comments have always been present, and not just this year. \n\"It is our families that we worry about at the moment,\" she says. \"So many Asian people work in the nail salon and hair industry, and the Atlanta violence felt much closer.\" \nMarulendra says the Asian American Student Union has met with the administration advocating for greater diversity in teaching faculty and staff, and for cultural sensitivity training. \"They have been pretty attentive in the past few weeks,\" she says. \nThe group held a campus vigil\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHERRY BLOSSOM TIME<|>EVENT<|>Cherry blossom time in the nation's capital is a celebration of the beauty of cherry trees gifted by Tokyo in 1912, symbolizing friendship between America and Japan.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOKYO<|>GEO<|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, which gifted cherry trees to the United States in 1912 to celebrate friendship.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in the United States where six Asian women were killed, prompting a vigil and discussions about anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Florida State University (FSU) is an educational institution where a vigil was held in memory of the victims of violence against Asian individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. SENATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The U.S. Senate is the legislative body that passed an Anti-Asian Hate bill in response to rising violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY DUCKWORTH<|>PERSON<|>Senator Amy Duckworth is an Asian-American senator who provided testimony about discriminatory behaviors faced by Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TALLAHASSEE<|>GEO<|>Tallahassee is the capital of Florida and a community where Asian Americans are experiencing heightened anxiety due to recent violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOSHIKO MURDICK<|>PERSON<|>Yoshiko Murdick is a 70-year-old Tallahassee watercolor painter who has lived in the U.S. since her 20s and expresses concerns about discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURORA HANSEN<|>PERSON<|>Aurora Hansen is a Filipino-American artistic director and community liaison involved in planning an Experience Asia Mini Festival in Tallahassee.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORTIA CAMPOS<|>PERSON<|>Portia Campos is an Assistant Teaching Professor at FSU and is involved in advocacy groups for Asian culture and community support.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TANVI MARULENDRA<|>PERSON<|>Tanvi Marulendra is an Indian-American student at FSU and the Director of the Asian American Student Union, advocating for diversity and cultural sensitivity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPERIENCE ASIA MINI FESTIVAL<|>EVENT<|>The Experience Asia Mini Festival is a community event planned in Tallahassee featuring Asian music, performers, and food, set for May 22.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOKYO<|>CHERRY BLOSSOM TIME<|>Tokyo gifted cherry trees to the U.S. in 1912, marking the beginning of cherry blossom celebrations in the nation's capital<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>U.S. SENATE<|>The U.S. Senate's passing of the Anti-Asian Hate bill was a response to the violence that occurred in Atlanta<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY DUCKWORTH<|>U.S. SENATE<|>Senator Amy Duckworth provided testimony to the U.S. Senate regarding the experiences of Asian-Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ATLANTA<|>FSU held a vigil in response to the violence against Asian individuals that occurred in Atlanta<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TALLAHASSEE<|>YOSHIKO MURDICK<|>Yoshiko Murdick is a resident of Tallahassee who expresses concerns about discrimination and violence against Asian Americans<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AURORA HANSEN<|>TALLAHASSEE<|>Aurora Hansen is actively involved in the Tallahassee community and is planning an event to celebrate Asian culture<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PORTIA CAMPOS<|>AURORA HANSEN<|>Portia Campos is collaborating with Aurora Hansen on community advocacy and cultural events in Tallahassee<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TANVI MARULENDRA<|>FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY<|>Tanvi Marulendra is the Director of the Asian American Student Union at FSU, advocating for diversity and cultural sensitivity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AURORA HANSEN<|>EXPERIENCE ASIA MINI FESTIVAL<|>Aurora Hansen is planning the Experience Asia Mini Festival, which celebrates Asian culture in Tallahassee<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOSHIKO MURDICK<|>TALLAHASSEE<|>Yoshiko Murdick is a member of the Tallahassee community who is concerned about the safety of Asian Americans<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
