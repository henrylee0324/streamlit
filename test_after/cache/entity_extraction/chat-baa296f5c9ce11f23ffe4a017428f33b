It's not your punchline,\" said Johnson who is Asian American and white. \"A lot of these jokes, I don't get what's funny about it.\" \nAbout 21% of Dublin school students are Asian American or Pacific Islander, according Ohio Department of Education data. \nHearing xenophobic comments takes a toll on the 15-year-old. \n\"It's so frustrating just because you know you are hearing this and it's not true but at the same time, you know there's nothing you can do about it,\" Johnson said. \nAnother way schools can help Asian American and other minority students is by hiring employees whose job is to focus on inclusion and equality for all students in every school building, said Gloria Chan, a 17-year-old senior at Thomas Worthington High School. \nNearly 5% of Worthington school students are Asian American or Pacific Islander like Chan, according to the latest state education data. \n\"I think it really starts with the teachers, because if the students are allowed to get by with that in the classroom, then they are going to do it outside of the classroom and at home, and it's just going to get worse,\" Chan said.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
