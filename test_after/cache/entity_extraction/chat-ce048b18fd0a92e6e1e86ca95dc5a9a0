Twice, she's been groped by men while she was a teenage girl, once at the CTA's Roosevelt Red Line stop and another time near her high school, Payton College Prep.\n\"I am an Asian woman, and I have to be aware of who I'm around,\" Zhang said. \"Whenever I go into these public spaces, I feel uncomfortable.\" \nDebunking the 'model minority' myth\nOver recent decades, Asian Americans have become associated with a new stereotype: the successful immigrant. As a group, they have the highest median income and education levels among racial groups, according to the Pew Research Center. But the label \"Asian American\" is exceedingly diverse -- an umbrella term for more than two dozen nationalities -- and also encompasses the U.S. racial group with the highest income inequality.\nThe triumph of some Asian Americans should not be attributed to an innate work ethic, scholars Min Zhou and Jennifer Lee argue in their 2017 paper \"Understanding the Asian American Achievement Paradox.\" They say that since the 1965 immigration act allowed more Asians to come to the U.S., a \"hyper-selectivity\" took root as immigrants from countries such as China were more likely to have bachelor's degrees compared with the rest of their originating country's population.\nLan Ho, a 30-year-old Vietnamese American woman who lives in the West Loop, said the elevation of prosperous Asian Americans, also known as the \"model minority\" myth, has masked the larger community's struggles and led to pushback last week to the notion that the Georgia shootings should be considered a hate crime. Authorities have said they are still investigating the cause.\n\"America tells us that we're not allowed to call it racism because we are essentially deemed the main beneficiaries of the American Dream,\" said Ho, co-founder of the Vietnamese coffee startup Fat Miilk. \"'You guys are out here being doctors and engineers and taking all of these really prestigious roles.' ... We say no to that.\"\nThe day after the shooting spree, Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said early indicators showed the attacks \"may not be\" racially motivated. Capt. Jay Baker elaborated that Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man who was charged with murder in the eight deaths, told police he was provoked by a \"sex addiction.\" Baker was later removed as the spokesman for the case after he also said Long had \"a really bad day\" and after an old Facebook post of Baker's surfaced with him promoting racist language tying China to the coronavirus.\nGrace Pai, organizing director of the Chicago chapter of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said the idea that the attacks were not racially motivated is \"ridiculous.\"\n\"Anybody can look at what he did: He targeted three Asian businesses and killed mostly Asian American women,\" Pai said about the alleged gunman. \"How is that not racially motivated?\"\nPai said the news of the Georgia shootings felt like a familiar nightmare come true. Fearing a wave of violence, Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Chicago had begun bystander intervention trainings last October, educating about 1,000 people as of last week on how to step in when they see anti-Asian harassment or discrimination.\nPai's organization also supports a proposal before the Illinois General Assembly that would require public schools to teach Asian American history. The legislation cleared a House committee the day after the mass shooting and now heads to the full chamber for further consideration. \"It's important to recognize Asian Americans in all their dimensions and afford us our full humanity rather than thinking of us only in terms of those success stories or the invisible, cheap labor that is also another prevalent view of our community,\" said state Rep. Theresa Mah, a Chicago Democrat co-sponsoring the proposal and whose 2nd House District includes Chicago's Chinatown.\nThis past Saturday, Chen, the Mandarin teacher from Bridgeport, stepped onto a bench at the foot of the Illinois Centennial Monument in Logan Square and peered out into the sea of hundreds of faces during a \"Stop Asian Hate\" rally. One of them was her 8-year-old son's.\nHer stories of racism and misogyny, bottled up for years, flowed from her as she gripped the megaphone. But so did something else: pride in an identity under attack.\n\"I am proud to be an Asian woman,\" Chen said in an interview later that day. \"The reason I was there today is not only to speak up for myself as an Asian woman ... it's for my own children in the future. I don't want them to live in fear.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
