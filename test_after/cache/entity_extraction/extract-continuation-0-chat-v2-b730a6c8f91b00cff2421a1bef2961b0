Their refusal to stand for justice has a price they are paying today. \nQ: Do you think the Biden administration can address the challenges threatening the U.S.? \nA: No, Biden is incapable of leading the United States. His honeymoon with the press and the left will end before Labor Day this year. Biden is a singular example of how the hatred of Blacks can help a mediocre non-original thinker American politician have a career in high office. He is white, male, mediocre, corrupt, and from one of the old slave-owning families. There is nothing distinguished about Biden's corrupt and bigoted career other than his ability to help keep the Anglo-American version of Apartheid alive by carrying the torch of racial hatred for his deceased Dixiecrat friends by exceeding their oppression of Blacks with his genocidal mass incarceration bill. He is a tool of the banking sector and if these forces wish to loot and destroy the lives of the American people for profit he will dutifully comply. \nBiden lacks the charisma or character to amount to anything without his handlers and managers scripting everything he says or does. Biden's presidency is a crime against all persons suffering from dementia to place them in such a demanding position when they are not certain of whether they are still alive. Biden who struggles to handle a press conference or climb the stairs is not up to the job. Biased media-stoked Trump hatred has made much of the world's public opinion akin to an LSD-addled cargo cult to such a degree someone so deeply flawed as is Biden with his foul temper, innate incompetence, pathological hatred of Blacks, and rapidly declining mental state can effectively perform the difficult job on earth- the presidency of the United States. Biden's Vice-Presidential choice is evidence that he has lost touch with reality and is on a sojourn to Cloud Kookoo Land. \nQ: What are the roots of deep division in American society, especially under Trump's presidency? \nA: The deepest rift in America is the issue of anti-DAFTAA (Descendants of Aboriginal and Forcibly Trafficked African Americans aka Blacks) hatred and systemic oppression. The very concept of White people and Black people is at the foundation of society. Whites are the perennial winners and Blacks are the genetic perennial losers. The whole society is structured around how the Whites maintain order, wealth, and one-sided justice for themselves and deny the same to the Blacks. Most of what people know about America is based on a selective history, and many lies and myths are foundational to the national identity. The first European settlements in North America (on land presently part of the United States) were not started by the English. \nThe Spanish had outposts in what is today Florida and South Carolina many decades before the establishment of Jamestown Virginia in 1607. In fact, a Spanish settlement on the PeeDee River in South Carolina was overrun by the Africans and Indians in 1525-nearly 100 years prior to the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1620. Secondly, the racist notion that the so-called American Indians were light-skinned Mongoloid-looking people is fiction that White Supremacists promote to hide the fact that many of the Aboriginal people of the Americas were like the indigenous people all over the world were dark in color-not white. In fact, Cristobal Colon (Christopher Columbus) called the people he first encountered in the Americas Indians because they were very dark in color. \nMany of the people the Europeans encountered in North America misnamed Indians later were misnamed Negroes and later Black after 1912. Any effort to understand America without understanding that 100 years before the Declaration of Independence Bacon's Rebellion (1676-1677) united Whites, Negroes (in the American colonial period the word Negro was inclusive of Africans and Indians), and their mixed children rose in revolt against the ruling English elites in Virginia. Angry rebels set much of Colonial Virginia alight, but Bacon became ill and died during the conflict which was suppressed shortly thereafter. \nThe ruling English elites, in an effort to destroy the solidarity and unity between the Africans, Aboriginals, and Europeans, created a color-based Apartheid-like caste system that made all persons classified as White superior free people and rendered Blacks subhuman slaves based on their color and blood. The system of Vita Durante (for life) slavery effectively made all whites and those who could become honorary whites (this is inclusive of Asians, Arabs, Turks, and mixed-race persons of the fair complexion) natural enemies of enslaved Blacks and they were rewarded for helping exploit, surveil, police, punish, kill, and enforcing the unjust order. Since the signing of the Declaration of Independence, racial hatred and racial oppression have always been central to the Anglo-American dominated republic. One of the main causes of the American Revolution was to prevent King George III's government's abolition of slavery and villeinage in the United Kingdom and due to the Crown's making Parliamentary laws binding on its North American colonists. \nTherefore, America was established in part to preserve the enslavement of Black people which was the primary wealth of wealthy Americans. Furthermore, the greatest threat to the American patriots winning their War for Independence against the British (1775-1783) was the threat of enslaved Blacks fighting for the English King. Royal Governor Lord Dunmore offered Blacks enslaved freedom if they fought to the Crown, and the American Patriots made no similar offer. As a result for every Black who joined the American revolutionists, another 5 fought for the British Army. Likewise, the British helped over 50,000 Blacks flee the United States to various parts of the British Empire, wherein they deprived the richest rebel patriots of their chattel property. Few people are aware that the War of 1812 was fought in part by the richest Americans trying to compel the British to return stolen slaves.
