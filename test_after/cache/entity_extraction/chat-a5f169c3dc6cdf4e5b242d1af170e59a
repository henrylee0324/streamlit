As first-generation immigrants, their English is not perfect. They work in a fast-food restaurant in suburban Atlanta where Sharker said a customer once threatened her father in a disagreement over the bill and customers have refused to be served by her mother because she wears a hijab.\nBut as much as she and other Asian Americans are more cautious now, they are also more energized, she said.\n“This,” she said, “has been an awakening for a lot of folks to say ‘Enough is enough.’”A woman leaves flowers at a memorial outside of Gold Spa in Atlanta following the mass shooting there, March 17, 2021.
