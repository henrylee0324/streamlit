Of the 19 incidents in 2019, 10 involved race, although races are not broken down. Seven incidents involved sexual orientation and two involved religion.\nFBI hate crime data is not available for 2020, but the ADL lists 19 incidents last year in Maine that did not rise to the level of a crime, up from 16 in 2019. The vast majority of those were related to white-supremacist propaganda.\nfears of being ignored\nChann, president of the Cambodian Community Association of Maine and an educator at the Holocaust and Human Rights Center of Maine, said he has heard of other racist actions against Asian Americans in southern Maine, including graffiti painted on the walls of an Asian market and comments made to a local woman while she was leading a church service. He believes some people are hesitant to report harassment or other crimes to police because Asian Americans have not felt heard or that their concerns are addressed.\n\"I think that's part of the trepidation that many people in the Asian American community feel when something happens. Will police listen? Will officials do anything about this? For a large part of our history in America, the answer has been no,\" he said. \"That's the reason many Asian Americans feel like they can't speak up, because they're just going to be ignored.\"\nThuy Sullivan, a UAC board member, said she and others in the Vietnamese community have felt uncomfortable and felt real fear, especially since the beginning of the pandemic. As national leaders used language like \"China virus\" during the pandemic, they noticed people moving away from them in stores, even though they were not more likely to have the virus.\n\"Many of us in the Asian communities in Portland have had experiences that make them feel very uncomfortable,\" she said.\nMany Asian Americans across the United States hesitate to report that type of biased behavior because they have been brought up in a culture where they were taught not to speak up, said Chea, the UAC's secretary and chief strategy officer.\n\"These are people who have survived the worst of humanity, war and genocide, and now they're forced to be afraid of radicalized domestic terrorists,\" she said. \"Many Asian immigrants are from authoritarian countries were speaking out against injustice means you are targeted, jailed and murdered.\"\n'needs to be brought to light'\nTheresa Kim, director of legal resources for UAC, is frustrated and discouraged that police did not immediately issue a summons to Sprague in connection with the incident on Forest Avenue. She worries that it will discourage people from speaking up and about what could happen if a future incident escalates to more violence.\n\"It's a topic that needs to be brought to light and that needs to be talked about,\" Kim said. \"It needs to stop being swept under the rug.\"\nThe leadership of United Asian Communities say they are trying to channel the grief, fear and sadness members of their community are feeling into action to combat bias and racism against Asian Americans. By coming together to standup for their communities, they are trying to combat stigmas and empower people to speak out without fear of local or immigration authorities, said Thomas Ling, who serves as vice president of the organization.\n\"I think right now, in this point in our history, it's more important than ever that the Asian American community is vocal and stands up and unifies and empowers each other,\" he said.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
