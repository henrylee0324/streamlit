Long was taken into custody and transported to the Crisp County jail.\nWith fear spreading across spas in the city, Atlanta police upped patrols Tuesday night in the area where the killings took place and dispatched officers to check on similar businesses nearby.\nOn Wednesday, a throng of media gathered outside Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa on a busy stretch of Piedmont Road near the Buckhead district of Atlanta widely known for its array of massage businesses and adult entertainment clubs.\nMany neighboring spas and massage businesses remained shuttered with their lights off.\n\"It's so hard,\" said Gina Ma, 50, the Chinese manager of Heavenly Feet Spa Massage, a small spa about a mile from the sites of the Atlanta killings. \"With Asian people, it's not easy in this country. Americans hate us.\"\nPolice came to Heavenly Feet on Tuesday evening to ask workers to close. On Wednesday, a sign outside the store said \"walk-ins welcome,\" but a slow trickle of men who walked up to the doors found them shut. The spa's four employees -- two men and two women -- were afraid to come to work.\n\"We just got scared,\" Ma said in a telephone interview.\nAfter the shootings, a few customers called to cancel deep-tissue foot massages. Some of her workers told her they didn't think they could work at the spa or stay in Georgia anymore.\n\"With COVID-19, it's not easy to find workers,\" she said. \"Today, workers -- they don't want to work the store anymore. They want to go to other states. They say Georgia is too dangerous.\"\nMa, who has worked at Heavenly Feet for eight years, said that she believed Americans had long resented Asians but that Trump had exacerbated resentment during the pandemic by making false claims that Chinese people brought the coronavirus to the country.\n\"They think we took their jobs because we work so hard,\" she said. \"They think we brought COVID-19.\"\nOver the last year, cities across the U.S. have documented a rise in aggression against Asian Americans. In a survey of police departments in 16 major cities, Cal State San Bernardino's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism found a total of 122 anti-Asian hate crimes in 2020 -- a 149% increase from 49 in 2019.\nSu Choe, a 31-year-old Korean community organizer for the Asian American Advocacy Fund in Atlanta, said she and other activists had called a rapid response team Wednesday morning to plan how to respond to the shootings -- a process that involved everything from trying to figure out what had happened and settle on the correct language to describe the violent attacks to raising financial resources and trying to reach victims.\n\"I think it's going to be a long journey,\" she said. \"It's a big shock to have such a tragedy so near. Knowing that four of those victims are Korean women.... They're from my community. They could be one of my friends, my neighbors.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HYUNDAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hyundai is a vehicle brand involved in a police incident in Atlanta where a vehicle was spotted and subsequently spun out of control.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILLY HANCOCK<|>PERSON<|>Billy Hancock is the Crisp County Sheriff who provided information about the police incident involving the Hyundai.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRISP COUNTY JAIL<|>GEO<|>Crisp County Jail is the facility where the suspect, Long, was taken into custody after the incident.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the city where the killings took place, prompting increased police patrols in the area.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLD SPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gold Spa is one of the massage businesses located in Atlanta near the site of the killings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AROMATHERAPY SPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Aromatherapy Spa is another massage business located in Atlanta near the site of the killings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIEDMONT ROAD<|>GEO<|>Piedmont Road is a busy street in Atlanta known for its array of massage businesses and adult entertainment clubs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVENLY FEET SPA MASSAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavenly Feet Spa Massage is a small spa managed by Gina Ma, located about a mile from the sites of the Atlanta killings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINA MA<|>PERSON<|>Gina Ma is the Chinese manager of Heavenly Feet Spa Massage who expressed concerns about safety following the killings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a pandemic that has affected the workforce and safety perceptions in the U.S., particularly among Asian communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SU CHOE<|>PERSON<|>Su Choe is a Korean community organizer for the Asian American Advocacy Fund in Atlanta who responded to the shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN ADVOCACY FUND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asian American Advocacy Fund is an organization involved in community response efforts following the shootings in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILLY HANCOCK<|>CRISP COUNTY JAIL<|>Billy Hancock, as the sheriff, is responsible for the custody of individuals at Crisp County Jail, including the suspect Long<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GOLD SPA<|>Gold Spa is located in Atlanta, which is the city where the killings occurred<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>AROMATHERAPY SPA<|>Aromatherapy Spa is located in Atlanta, which is the city where the killings occurred<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>HEAVENLY FEET SPA MASSAGE<|>Heavenly Feet Spa Massage is located in Atlanta, which is the city where the killings occurred<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEAVENLY FEET SPA MASSAGE<|>GINA MA<|>Gina Ma is the manager of Heavenly Feet Spa Massage, which is affected by the recent violence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>GINA MA<|>Gina Ma mentioned COVID-19 as a factor affecting the workforce and safety perceptions in her spa<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SU CHOE<|>ASIAN AMERICAN ADVOCACY FUND<|>Su Choe is a community organizer for the Asian American Advocacy Fund, which is involved in responding to the shootings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SU CHOE<|>ATLANTA<|>Su Choe is responding to the violent attacks that occurred in Atlanta<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEAVENLY FEET SPA MASSAGE<|>ATLANTA<|>Heavenly Feet Spa Massage is located in Atlanta, which is the city where the killings occurred<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
