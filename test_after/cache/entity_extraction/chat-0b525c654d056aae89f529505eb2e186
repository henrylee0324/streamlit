So, when it comes to discussing more serious matters, such as the growing anti-Asian hate and violence in our communities, it may be challenging for parents to get a good sense of what they are thinking and feeling on a deeper level.\nTo gain better perspective, AsAmNews interviewed nine Asian American teenagers from across the country to get them to talk frankly about the surge of anti-Asian attacks, how it has personally affected them, and what they believe can be done to help stop Asian hate.\nGregory Lee, age 15\nPublic School Student, Menlo Park, CA.\n“The anti-Asian hate attacks are quite troubling and make me question the integrity and morality of Americans. Personally, these attacks have not affected my day to day life, nor have they affected myself going outside or back to school. I do realize that I may be in a minority here, so I feel lucky. As of now, I am not afraid of being bullied or attacked because I am Asian, but I am definitely more aware and untrusting towards the public. Unfortunately, I do not think stopping Asian hate or really any type of hate is possible, as there will always be people who are unaccepting or scared of outsiders. The best we can do is bring attention to the problem and try to fix issues in our local communities in order to enact widespread change and allow Asians to feel safe. I find it frustrating that people always find scapegoats for their problems instead of facing their issues head-on. The adults of this world should not act like young children who have a simplistic and childish vendetta against people who haven’t done anything directly to them.”\nJustine Schulke, age 15 \nPrivate School Student, New York City\n“People may think that Anti-Asian violence started because of the coronavirus — since it originated in China — but racism against Asians Americans has existed in our country for years. Though I’ve never experienced anti-Asian racism directly, I’ve consumed the recent attacks through the media and from my family’s experiences. The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement shed light on how systematic racism exists, and has always existed, in our country. I’m not surprised to know something like hate crimes are now skyrocketing against the Asian community, but it’s frustrating to see how so many people continue to be so ignorant and heinous, hating and abusing our elders for something they haven’t done. There are notions that Asians aren’t truly American. Asians are associated with exoticity, which makes Asians seem foreign. The news of these attacks have not had a significant effect on my day to day life, but I now carry a keychain with an alarm just in case, and I’m not allowed to take the subway. I feel extremely safe at school. My school has been implementing many conversations on race, racism and what we need to do as a school and community to be anti-racist. Our summer reading homework of 2020 was to read Stamped: Racism, Anti Racism, and You: A Remix of the National Book Award-winning Stamped from the Beginning by Ibram X. Kendi. However, in public, there is a subconscious thought in the back of my head whether I might be the next Asian American involved in a hate crime. I think the first step to stopping the hate is to acknowledge that there are hate crimes happening against the Asian community. Secondly, we need to address this issue to the school, or if you’re uncomfortable, to spread awareness on social media and to your friends. Further, we should talk about these violent attacks within the school community, at a workplace, or wherever you are to denounce anti-Asian racism. Finally, we need to get involved, whether that be attending protests, handing out fliers, supporting Asian owned businesses, reporting hate crimes, condemning hate, and combating the prejudice and bigotry of the connection between Asians and Covid-19.”\nMegan Kwan, age 16 years old\nPublic School Student, Framingham, M.A.\n“I’m absolutely disgusted by recent attacks on Asian Americans. Why is it that murder needs to occur before the world recognizes the discrimination against Asians every day? I hate how people are excusing their actions with trivial excuses. I hate how people are just now trying to stop the hate. Although support is always welcome, it should not have had to take death to finally get the media’s attention and for people to realize just how normalized these attacks are. I fear for the safety of my family and others. I should not be scared that my grandmother might get beaten every time she goes to Chinatown, or that my sister will be called racist names when she goes back to school. Fear is just the beginning of it. It also affects me due to the media attention it’s received recently. Everywhere I see people arguing online because someone is so uneducated that they believe it is called the ‘Chinese virus’ because it’s from China. I want people to stand up for Asians because they recognize that we are being harassed and assaulted. I want them to realize that asking if someone has eaten a dog before is just as racist and harmful as the attacks you see on the news. I am scared of what would happen at school. Although I’ve never experienced bullying before, I’m deathly afraid of the harassment I might receive if I go back. Before Corona, there were multiple instances of racism at my school, and I fully believe that it would increase. Such as people only grouping me with Asians because we’re the same, people telling me I have small eyes, people mocking my food, asking if I eat dogs, etc. I’m not very strong or athletic, so If\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
