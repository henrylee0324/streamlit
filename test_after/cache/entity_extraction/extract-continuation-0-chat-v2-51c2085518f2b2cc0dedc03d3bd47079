He has been released on bail.\nThe attorney general's complaint seeks an order protecting the woman and her family by prohibiting Sprague from having any contact with them and from violating the Maine Civil Rights Act in the future.\n\"We are bearing witness to an unconscionable increase in hate crimes being perpetrated against individuals of Asian descent in our nation,\" Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said in a news release. \"We will not tolerate such attacks in Maine and we will act swiftly to address allegations like those received last week in Portland.\n\"We encourage any member of Maine's Asian-American community to contact their local law enforcement agency if they encounter threats or acts of violence or property damage based on bias against their race, ancestry or national origin. We will review all such cases to determine whether they meet the criteria for enforcement under our Civil Rights Act.\"\nMarpheen Chann, president of the Cambodian Community Association of Maine and an educator at the Holocaust and Human Rights Center of Maine, applauded the attorney general's action Monday, though he said there is still work to be done in law enforcement when it comes to recognizing and responding to racism.\n\"I think it's a very important statement from AG Frey,\" Chann said. \"We need to call racism for what it is. It's racism and this act was a racist act against an Asian-American woman and her daughter while trying to go about their day. I think Attorney General Frey has taken a step in the right direction for calling it what it is and alerting the public that this isn't acceptable behavior.\"\nThe woman and her daughter were in their car waiting for an oil change at 471 Forest Ave. last week, the complaint states. Sprague was walking along the road when he turned and started swearing at the woman, telling her to \"go back to your country\" and \"you Chinese go back to your country.\"\nSprague then jumped over the guardrail separating the sidewalk from the service station and began kicking the woman's partially opened window. His kicking damaged her rearview mirror, causing debris to fly into her car and hit her daughter.\nPolice have said Sprague is homeless and it was unclear Monday if he has an attorney.\nThere is no criminal charge of \"hate crime\" in Maine statute. A person accused of civil rights violations may be charged for interference with constitutional or civil rights or, in cases where there is an injunction under the Civil Rights Act, for a knowing violation of a civil rights injunction. Both are Class D crimes punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a $2,000 fine.\nIn addition, any crime may be treated as a hate crime at sentencing if the court finds that the defendant targeted the victim due to the victim's \"race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation or homelessness.\"\nWhile there is a federal hate crimes statute, it has a higher threshold for bringing prosecution and comes with restrictions on the circumstances under which a case may be brought, such as that the crime resulting in willful bodily injury or attempted bodily injury. There are also certain circumstances pertaining to the federal charge such as if the crime takes place across state lines or involves a weapon that has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.\nA recent study by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism found anti-Asian hate crimes increased 145 percent last year in America's largest cities, even as overall hate crimes dropped 6 percent.\nLast week, in the wake of the killing of eight people, including six Asian-American women, in Georgia, President Biden said he supports the passage of a COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would expedite the federal government's response to the rise of hate crimes exacerbated during the pandemic, support state and local governments to improve hate crimes reporting, and ensure that hate crimes information is more accessible to Asian-American communities.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAINE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Maine Attorney General's Office is responsible for enforcing the law and protecting civil rights in Maine, including filing complaints against individuals accused of civil rights violations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TROY SPRAGUE<|>PERSON<|>Troy Sprague is a 47-year-old man accused of attacking an Asian-American woman and her daughter, leading to civil rights complaints against him.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AARON FREY<|>PERSON<|>Aaron Frey is the Maine Attorney General who commented on the increase in hate crimes and the actions taken against Troy Sprague.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARPHEN CHANN<|>PERSON<|>Marpheen Chann is the president of the Cambodian Community Association of Maine and an educator who supports the attorney general's actions against hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAMBODIAN COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION OF MAINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Cambodian Community Association of Maine advocates for the Cambodian community and addresses issues related to racism and civil rights.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORTLAND<|>GEO<|>Portland is a city in Maine where the alleged attack on the Asian-American woman and her daughter took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>471 FOREST AVE.<|>GEO<|>471 Forest Ave. is the location in Portland where the incident involving Troy Sprague occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act is a proposed legislation aimed at addressing the rise of hate crimes, particularly against Asian-American communities during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism conducts research on hate crimes and reported a significant increase in anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAINE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE<|>TROY SPRAGUE<|>The Maine Attorney General's Office is filing a civil rights complaint against Troy Sprague for his alleged attack on an Asian-American woman and her daughter.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AARON FREY<|>MAINE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE<|>Aaron Frey, as the Attorney General, represents the Maine Attorney General's Office and has made statements regarding the increase in hate crimes.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARPHEN CHANN<|>MAINE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE<|>Marpheen Chann applauded the actions of the Maine Attorney General's Office in addressing hate crimes, indicating support for their efforts.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TROY SPRAGUE<|>PORTLAND<|>Troy Sprague is accused of committing a hate crime in Portland against an Asian-American woman and her daughter.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TROY SPRAGUE<|>471 FOREST AVE.<|>The incident involving Troy Sprague occurred at 471 Forest Ave. in Portland.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism's report on the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes supports the need for the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AARON FREY<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>Aaron Frey supports the passage of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to address the rise of hate crimes during the pandemic.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
