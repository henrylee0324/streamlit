His next court date is set for Monday. He was charged with two counts of assault in the second degree as a hate crime and one count of attempted assault in the first degree as a hate crime the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said.\nThe Legal Aid Society which is representing Elliot said in a statement: \"We strongly urge the public to reserve judgment until all the facts are presented in court.\"\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance described the incident as a \"brutal attack.\"\n\"There is no place for these atrocious acts of violence in New York\" Vance said in a statement.\nThe attack occurred before noon Monday outside a luxury apartment building in Midtown Manhattan. The suspect hurled anti-Asian sentiments and assaulted the 65-year-old woman New York Police Department said.\n'We need to make the most of this moment': Asian American activists are demanding equal civil rights better education in schools after Asian hate attacks\nSurveillance video from inside the building captured images of a man kicking and stomping the woman repeatedly. In a short version of the video staff do not immediately appear to intervene but a longer video shared with local media shows building staff aiding the woman after the suspect flees.\nThe woman was hospitalized with serious injuries but released Tuesday. Vance's office said that the woman was diagnosed with diagnosed with a fractured pelvis forehead contusions and contusions across her body.\nThe woman's daughter speaking with The New York Times identified her as Vilma Kari and said her mother emigrated from the Philippines. The Times did not identify the daughter.\nIn a GoFundMe Elizabeth Kari identifies herself as Vilma Kari's daughter and said her mother has been \"humbled by the outpouring of messages and support from not only our friends and family but from the kind souls all over the world. I am happy to share she is safe and in good spirits.\" The GoFundMe has raised more than $76000 as of Thursday afternoon.\nOn the GoFundMe page Kari wrote that someone across the street who has not been identified shouted at her mother's assailant to get his attention and draw him away. \"This gesture of action is what we need in our world right now. I hope one day my mom and I can thank you personally\" she wrote.\nPolice said the woman was walking to church when she was attacked. The man shouted anti-Asian slurs at her and told her \"You don’t belong here\" police said.\n“Let me be clear: this brave woman belongs here. Asian-American New Yorkers belong here. Everyone belongs here. Attacks against Asian-American New Yorkers are attacks against all New Yorkers and my Office will continue to stand against hate in all its forms\" Vance said in a statement.\nElliot was living in a hotel nearby that serves as a homeless shelter police said. Elliot was convicted of stabbing his mother to death in the Bronx in 2002 when he was 19 online court records show. He was released from prison in 2019 and is on lifetime parole.\n“For the life of me I don’t understand why we are releasing or pushing people out of prison – not to give them second chances but to put them into homeless facilities or shelters or in this case a hotel – and expect good outcomes” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a news conference Wednesday. “We need real opportunities. We need real safety nets.”\nOfficials in New York City and beyond swiftly condemned the attack and highlighted how it was another case in a growing number of incidents of anti-Asian hate and discrimination amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMore than 3795 incidents were reported to Stop AAPI Hate from March 19 2020 to Feb. 28 2021 “only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur” the advocacy group said. The organization tracks incidents of hate violence harassment and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the U.S.\nMayor Bill de Blasio called the incident “absolutely disgusting and outrageous” and said it was “absolutely unacceptable” that witnesses did not intervene.\nIn a statement the head of the union representing the building workers disputed the allegation that workers did not act.\n“Our union is working to get further details for a more complete account and urges the public to avoid a rush to judgment while the facts are determined” union president Kyle Bragg said.\nThe union initially said the workers immediately called for help but on Wednesday said they waited until the attacker left to aid the woman and flag a police car.\nA video released to PIX11 shows staff waiting until the attacker appears to leave the area before going outside to assist the woman. The TV station reported the workers waited because they believed the suspect had a knife.\nDetective Michael Rodriguez said Wednesday that patrol officers came upon the victim after she was assaulted.\nThe management company of the apartment building where the attack occurred said Monday that it had suspended the staff members pending an investigation.\n\"The Brodsky Organization condemns all forms of discrimination racism xenophobia and violence against the Asian American community\" the company said.\nThe victim “could easily have been my mother” said Andrew Yang a mayoral candidate and the son of Taiwanese immigrants. Yang also called bystanders' apparent inaction \"exactly the opposite of what we need here in New York City.\"\nGov. Andrew Cuomo also weighed in calling the attack \"horrifying and repugnant.\"\nPolice sought the public's help in the case and have said they were increasing patrols in predominantly Asian communities amid the spike in incidents. In New York City there have been 33 hate crimes with an Asian victim as of Sunday compared with 11 as of this time last year the NYPD said.\nIn Washington on Tuesday Attorney General Merrick Garland announced a 30-day review to assess the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
