According to a Stop AAPI Hate, 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents -most directed at women - were reported in 2020 (1,200 more than the previous year). But it is also true that federal data, as cited on a news channel, suggest that violence in America occurs within racial groups, the exception being Asian Americans who are more likely to be attacked by African Americans than by members of their own ethnicity or by Whites. \nThe Atlanta murders, once fully investigated, may well turn out to be racial in under- or over-tones. But there is no justification to hurry the verdict, or to add insult to injury by suggesting the killer wanted to cut down Asians. Nor should it be suggested that this represents the fetish White males have for Asian women as sex objects and therefore exploitable and expendable. What we need to decry as much as racism, are assessments such as offered by Charissa Cheah, a psychology professor: \"Those in power, and in this case those who are white and male, maintain their power partly by determining and defining what constitutes violations of these rules. What we are seeing is a key characteristic of institutional and systemic racism and misogyny.\" \nNotice the contrasting absence of any assertion of racism in the more horrific March 22, 2021 killing of ten innocent shoppers in a grocery store in Colorado. In this case, even the name of the accused was not immediately announced, and media reporting or politicians' statements thus far have refrained from linking the Syrian immigrant's Muslim ethnicity to racial hate-based or terrorist crime. \nUnless evidence of calculated racist intent emerges, it would be just to treat the savage mass killings in Atlanta and Colorado not as products of White or Islamic racism but of sick minds' demonic acts that constitute a gross crime against humanity. \n(The views expressed here are solely of the author, an Indian American published author and opinion writer.)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that tracks and reports incidents of anti-Asian hate in the United States, highlighting the surge in crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARISSA CHEAH<|>PERSON<|>Charissa Cheah is a psychology professor who discusses the dynamics of power and racism in her statements regarding institutional and systemic racism and misogyny.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA MURDERS<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta murders refer to a series of shootings that occurred in Atlanta, which raised discussions about racial motivations and hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLORADO KILLINGS<|>EVENT<|>The Colorado killings refer to a mass shooting incident that took place in a grocery store, which has been discussed in the context of racial and ethnic violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIAN AMERICAN<|>PERSON<|>An Indian American is a person of Indian origin or descent who is a citizen or resident of the United States, in this context referring to the author of the text.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>CHARISSA CHEAH<|>Charissa Cheah's discussions on racism and misogyny relate to the work of Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks anti-Asian hate incidents<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA MURDERS<|>COLORADO KILLINGS<|>Both events are mass killings that have sparked discussions about race and violence in America<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARISSA CHEAH<|>ATLANTA MURDERS<|>Charissa Cheah's analysis of systemic racism may apply to the discussions surrounding the Atlanta murders<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARISSA CHEAH<|>COLORADO KILLINGS<|>Charissa Cheah's analysis of systemic racism may apply to the discussions surrounding the Colorado killings<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIAN AMERICAN<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The author identifies as an Indian American and discusses the issues faced by Asian Americans, which Stop AAPI Hate addresses<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
