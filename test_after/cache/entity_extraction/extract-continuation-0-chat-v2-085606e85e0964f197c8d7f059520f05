Watching the replay of the attack, I realized that the victim could have been me an Asian man who walked alone in the same area a year ago. \nâ€• \nAlthough Asians and Asian-Americans have been continuously attacked amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, hate crime charges by these communities are very rare. A survey published in 2020 found that 31% of Asian American adults have been subjected to racial slurs, yet only 3,800 hate crime reports were received by the Stop AAPI Hate organization in the past year - a very small percentage of 22 million Asian Americans. \nA reason behind victims' hesitancy to report an incident is the element of behavior in connection to race. Oftentimes, the older generation of Asian immigrants is the quiet minority who might not feel the need to stand up for themselves. \"My difficulty, or reluctance, in speaking about my anger isn't because I'm not infuriated, (but because) I've been trained to suppress my rage,\" expressed Claudine Ko, an editor at the New York Times. Addressing this point of view of older Asian immigrants and Asian Americans can help change reporting patterns of the future. \nThe solution starts with the Asian immigrants' children, a younger generation who may be more politically engaged and can use their involvement to change their parents' behavior. But what if the children themselves are the quiet people who cannot manage to have sensitive \nconversations with their parents? A study conducted by Asian American researchers found that Asian American college students have very low utilization rates of mental health services despite showing high levels of psychological distress. In fact, Asian American females from 15 to 24 years old have the highest rate of depressive symptoms among young women. \nIf we can promote mental health services better and target the needs of Asian and Asian American college students, we can help students realize the importance of mental health and the need to discuss serious topics like racism. At the University of Rochester, the president expressed her condolences to the AAPI community after the Atlanta shooting and reiterated on-campus mental health resources. Workshops led by Asian voices and a candlelight vigil were hosted by student organizations to address recent hate crime incidents and to let students share their feelings. Besides these steps, higher education institutions should also promote online resources allowing for direct participation in antiracist activities. Reporting hate crime incidents at Stop AAPI Hate and donating to the Hate Is A Virus organization are just some of the many steps that could be advocated for. \nIt is time for Asians and Asian Americans, regardless of our age, to un-suppress our rage and speak about our thoughts, loud and clear. \nPhuong Le is an engineering and public health student at the University of Rochester.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MANHATTAN<|>GEO<|>Manhattan is a borough of New York City, known for its diverse population and cultural significance, where a stabbing incident occurred in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in Manhattan, known for its large Asian community and cultural heritage, where the stabbing incident took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that tracks and addresses hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, receiving reports of hate incidents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HATE IS A VIRUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hate Is A Virus is an organization that advocates against hate crimes and supports the AAPI community through various initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLAUDINE KO<|>PERSON<|>Claudine Ko is an editor at the New York Times who expressed her views on the challenges faced by the Asian community regarding hate crimes and emotional expression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Rochester is an educational institution that provides mental health resources and support to its students, particularly in response to hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENTS<|>PERSON<|>Asian American college students are a demographic that has shown low utilization rates of mental health services despite high levels of psychological distress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA SHOOTING<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta shooting refers to a tragic event that targeted the AAPI community, prompting responses from various organizations and institutions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANHATTAN<|>CHINATOWN<|>The stabbing incident occurred in Chinatown, which is located in Manhattan, highlighting the area's significance to the Asian community<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>HATE IS A VIRUS<|>Both organizations work towards addressing hate crimes against the AAPI community and support victims<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLAUDINE KO<|>UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER<|>Claudine Ko's comments reflect the broader issues faced by students at institutions like the University of Rochester, particularly regarding mental health and hate crimes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER<|>ASIAN AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENTS<|>The University of Rochester provides mental health resources for Asian American college students, who are facing psychological distress<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA SHOOTING<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The Atlanta shooting incident raised awareness and prompted reports to Stop AAPI Hate, highlighting the need for action against hate crimes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA SHOOTING<|>UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER<|>The University of Rochester expressed condolences to the AAPI community following the Atlanta shooting, indicating a connection to the event<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
