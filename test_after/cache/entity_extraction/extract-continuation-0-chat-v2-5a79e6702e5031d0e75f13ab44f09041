As Main Street Patrol was winding down its Saturday tour in Flushing, another group was assembling in Confucius Plaza in Manhattan. Ricky Yang stood behind a folding table with a sign that read \"Protect Chinatown,\" the group he established in February as a chaperone service, which got off to a slow start. Now the group was setting out on foot patrols in part to raise awareness about its services and to monitor the streets. As volunteers mobilized one older man of Asian descent stopped to ask a question not about safety measures but about the Covid-19 vaccine.Before sending teams out, Mr. Yang, 27, emphasized hypervigilance. Like Main Street, Protect Chinatown is focused on safe intervention.\"If someone was punching me in the face I would want someone to step in,\" Mr. Yang said. \"Now all anyone does is take out their phone and record.\" Among those patrolling that day was Ian Tan, a 24-year-old who works in commercial production. Mr. Tan has volunteered as a chaperone and also attended Protect Chinatown's first patrol the weekend before. \"I wish I didn't have to do this,\" he said, sounding exasperated, \"but it feels like no one else will.\"Mr. Tan led a team of five east along Division Street to patrol the Two Bridges neighborhood. Other groups took on the north and east sides of Chinatown.\"The world shouldn't have to have initiatives like this,\" Mr. Yang said, adding that he hopes that one day people will again feel safe in their communities and services like Protect Chinatown's will be unnecessary. \"The whole goal is that it can be dissolved.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAIN STREET PATROL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Main Street Patrol is a community safety initiative that conducts tours to enhance public safety awareness in Flushing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTECT CHINATOWN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Protect Chinatown is a chaperone service established by Ricky Yang to ensure safety and monitor the streets in Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICKY YANG<|>PERSON<|>Ricky Yang is the founder of Protect Chinatown, focused on community safety and intervention.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IAN TAN<|>PERSON<|>Ian Tan is a volunteer with Protect Chinatown who participates in patrols to enhance safety in the community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLUSHING<|>GEO<|>Flushing is a neighborhood where Main Street Patrol conducts safety tours.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood where Protect Chinatown operates to ensure community safety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWO BRIDGES<|>GEO<|>Two Bridges is a neighborhood in Manhattan where patrols are conducted by volunteers from Protect Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICKY YANG<|>PROTECT CHINATOWN<|>Ricky Yang is the founder of Protect Chinatown, leading the initiative for community safety<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IAN TAN<|>PROTECT CHINATOWN<|>Ian Tan is a volunteer with Protect Chinatown, participating in patrols<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAIN STREET PATROL<|>FLUSHING<|>Main Street Patrol conducts safety tours in Flushing to raise awareness<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROTECT CHINATOWN<|>CHINATOWN<|>Protect Chinatown operates in Chinatown to ensure safety and monitor the streets<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IAN TAN<|>TWO BRIDGES<|>Ian Tan led a patrol team in the Two Bridges neighborhood as part of Protect Chinatown<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICKY YANG<|>CHINATOWN<|>Ricky Yang's initiative Protect Chinatown focuses on safety in the Chinatown area<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
