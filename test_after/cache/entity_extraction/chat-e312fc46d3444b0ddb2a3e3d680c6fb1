My heart ached.\" \nWhen she saw that another victim was a Korean mother of mixed-race children, she saw in them herself and her own mixed-race son. \n\"I felt really bad for her sons, because my son is also half Korean, half White. And I know that her sons, both of her sons were mixed race, and I just somehow put myself into her position. What if I were her? What if my son was the one who was interviewed this interview?\" \nMing was born in Indiana to parents who emigrated from China and were the only ones in their families to live in the United States. \nHer mother was in graduate school when she was born, so Ming was sent to live with her grandparents in China until her mother obtained her degree. Then, when Ming was 4, her father died of cancer. \n\"Reading a lot about the women reminded me a lot about my mom and also my grandmother, who's still in China, but she is very much working class and has suffered through a lot just to make sure her kids were able to have a better life. And I think my mom was the same way.\" \nMing was \"thinking about her struggles in this country and trying to not just make enough money to support me but also dealing with so much racism and sexism along the way. I really thought of my parents in these women.\" \nEnd \nEnd \nEnd \nMing, a campaign manager for gender and worker justice at the advocacy organization Citizen Action of New York, said her first reaction to the shootings was: \"Of course this happened. It was the inevitable end point.\" \nFor months, many Asian Americans across the country had witnessed attacks and harassment spurred by the pandemic and had become increasingly anxious. Yet she still felt there wasn't enough awareness of the xenophobia tied to the pandemic. \n\"I'm seeing a lot of Asian people, that this was the final wake-up call for them rather than all the hate that has gone on during the pandemic and all the racism that had gone on beforehand, [and it] finally took a shooting to get them to pay attention.\" \nAmong the things that too many people seemed to newly learn about Asian Americans in the wake of the shooting: that there is a growing contingent of them in the South. Ming grew up in Texas and North Carolina, two states where the Asian American population has increased. \nAd \n\"People always forget that there are Asians in the South. There's a level of invisibility, when in actually, there are so many Asians in places like Georgia and Texas.\" \n\"I definitely feel like I'm still processing,\" Ming said in an interview late April, more than a month and a half after the shootings. She is constantly reminded of the shootings and other violent attacks in her work, which is focused on social justice and advocacy. As the only person of Asian descent in her organization, it can feel isolating to process it alone. \n\"Having that constant stream of images and video of violence has made it very hard to process and hard to grieve,\" Ming said. \"I think it's going to be an ongoing grieving process.\" \nThey represented a diverse community: A single mother of two sons in their early 20s. Two emigrated from South Korea in the 1980s. A grandmother of six in a multiracial family with relatives in Japan. A Chinese American mother who owned two spa businesses. One had no family in the United States. \nSix of the eight people who died in the Atlanta-area spa shootings in March were women of Asian descent. They represented a diaspora that includes some 50 ethnicities, even more languages and dialects, and countless experiences. \nYet despite the diversity of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) experience, the women's deaths resonated throughout the community in a distinctly familiar \nway. \nAnd they particularly hit home for many Asian American women: That could have been my mother, my grandmother. It could have been me. \nSo different, yet somehow so similar: That has long been a characteristic of the Asian diaspora in America, said Eileen Cheng-yin Chow, a professor of Asian American and diaspora studies at Duke University: The \"idea of 'people like you' as Asian Americans has been strangely specific yet diffuse.\" \n\"My immigrant experience is not the same as these women, but I felt it in my bones. Because to be here is to be the same,\" Chow said. \nWe spoke with 10 Asian American women across the country about the connection they feel to the six slain women, despite living drastically different lives. They shared stories about the sacrifices of their immigrant parents and grandparents, and the resilience required to assimilate in a country where Asians face ongoing harassment and xenophobia. \nIn 2008, Hatta was one of about 10 people working at the Arkansas Democratic Party headquarters when a gunman opened fire and killed Bill Gwatney, the state party chairman. \nHatta, a public affairs consultant and artist, has worked on several political campaigns, including Bill Clinton's campaigns in 1992 and 1996. She settled down in Arkansas in 2005 after working there on a presidential campaign. \nHatta frequently gets calls from people checking in on her whenever a mass shooting occurs. That's how she found out about the Atlanta shooting. \n\"People reach out to me when these things happen. Sometimes it's worse than others. Sometimes it's unfortunately just another shooting,\" she said. \"But this one is different in that workplace ones always kind of hit a little close to home. And being primarily women and then Asian women, it was just a little harder, because obviously I identify as both.\" \nHatta grew up in a small town of 10,000 people in a northeastern Ohio.
