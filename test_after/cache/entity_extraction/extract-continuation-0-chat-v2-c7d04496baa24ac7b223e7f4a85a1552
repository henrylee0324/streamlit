Violence also has been fueled by racist rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic.\nLiu joined about a hundred people who gathered at Monument Circle Saturday to rally against anti-Asian violence and demand an end to bigotry, xenophobia and racism.\n\"We are Americans, we are mothers, we are friends, we live here,\" Liu said. \"We love our community. This affects all of us, and we don't want any violence against anyone.\"\nThe rally was hosted by the Indianapolis Chinese Community Center Inc., the Asian American Alliance Inc., and other Asian American and Pacific Islander organizations in Indianapolis such as the America China Society of Indiana, the Korean American Association of Indiana, the Burmese American Community Institute, and the Asian American Association at Indiana University. Members of the Indiana Chapter of ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) were also in attendance.\nSimilar demonstrations were held the same day in 60 other cities across the United States, including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.\nQuanbo Xiong, who is the Indianapolis Chinese Community Center Inc. president, said Asian American Hoosiers are scared and hurt.\n\"But if we don't do anything (the violence) will happen to us someday,\" Xiong said. \"We have to act and raise our voice, raise awareness on tolerance, on Asian history.\"\nAccording to a report by Stop AAPI Hate, more than 3,800 hate crimes against Asian American and Pacific Islander communities had been reported in the United States since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\nAnti-Asian incidents document in Indiana communities\nThere's no data yet available about the total of anti-Asian harassment incidents in Indiana, but some incidents have been documented in Plymouth, Chesterton, Martinsville and Mooresville.\nThe Anti-Defamation League tracked increases in white supremacist hate propaganda activity. In 2020, 57 such incidents were reported in Indiana, which is a 24% increase from 2019.\nDeputy Mayor Thomas, Congressman Carson attend event\nJudith Thomas, Indianapolis deputy mayor of neighborhood engagement, and U.S. Rep. André Carson, a Democrat who represents Indianapolis, were among the speakers at the event.\nThomas told the crowd Saturday that the city of Indianapolis hears and sees the Asian American communities and their concerns.\n\"The city is behind you,\" she said. \"We know diversity is one of our greatest assets and we need to celebrate that. This also means we need to listen to those who are suffering and figure out what we can do next.\"\nCarson said in order to fight hatred brewing in the country, elected officials must fight racism together.\n\"Politicians, we have to come together and put aside our differences,\" he said. \"We need more allies to tell America that we will not stand for bigotry, xenophobia, or anything that seeks to oppress this community.\"\nAccording to Census data, Asian Hoosiers make up nearly 4% of Marion County's population and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Hoosiers make up less than 1%.\nThe population has grown in some Indianapolis suburbs and surrounding counties.\nAsian Hoosiers make up 6% of Hamilton County's population, 7% of Monroe County's and 4% of Johnson County's population. Statewide, Asian Hoosiers make up nearly 3% of the population.
