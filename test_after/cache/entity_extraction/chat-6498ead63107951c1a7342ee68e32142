They met to process feelings about the slayings, which included six women of Asian descent,\nand happened just as new reports described a rise in anti-Asian hate.\nThey needed to talk it out with other people who, they knew, would simply get it.\nThey dont see us as humans, they see us as temptations, said editor in chief\nAmy Nguyen, 20, speaking about the so-called sexual addiction that may have motivated the killer. The\ntemptations were Asian women simply existing.\nShe remembered times when non-Asian men had asked her if she had any specifically Asian friends they could\ndate.\nThese people are the ones who are silent now, she said. You liked Asian women and appreciated us then, but now\nyoure silent. The group agreed that change would require Asians and non-Asians speaking up.\nIt highlights how were seen as objects, Dencie Devora, 21, said. She spoke of Japanese characters on T-shirts and\ntattoos, and how everyone seems to love Chinese food. Theres appreciation for the culture, but no respect.\nAmy Pham, 18, noted how close several of the victims were to her mothers age, and how long it took to get that\ninformation.\nThere just wasnt much emphasis on them, she said.\nPrakash Vasanthakumar, 19, called the shooting domestic terrorism.\nThey discussed racist jokes theyd let slide at their high schools, their gratitude for finding each other, and\nassumptions people made. Someone at USF had recently asked Nguyen, who grew up in Pasco County, if she was\nan international student.\nThat happened to me today! Pham said, laughing.\nClearly it wasnt their Asian-ness that united the diverse group, which included students of Vietnamese, Indian and\nFilipino descent. It was the rest of the worlds reaction to it.\nHate crimes vs. racist incidents\nThe Tampa Bay area has not seen the violence against Asians, especially women and the elderly, that has shaken\ncommunities in larger cities like Los Angeles and New York. But locals are highly aware of it.\nIts so scary, said Winnie Tang, the vice president of the Asian American Federation of Florida. Its getting worse.\nThe hurt keeps getting deeper.\nWe have friends and family in all those cities, said Man Le, founder of the Tampa chapter of the National\nAssociation of Asian American Professionals and an administrator for the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway\nAuthority. If it affects someone in Atlanta, it affects someone here.\nThe Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University released a study this month showing\nreported hate crimes against Asian Americans rose 149 percent between 2019 and 2020. That was as hate crimes\noverall declined.\nAnother group called Stop AAPI Hate AAPI stands for Asian American and Pacific Islander tallied 3,800 hateful incidents nationwide during the first year of the pandemic.\nIn a national survey by the Hate Crime Research and Policy Institute at Florida State University, over 30 percent of\nAsian respondents indicated they changed their behavior to avoid the possibility of harassment by avoiding\nspecific locations, being more aware of their surroundings, paying attention to how they speak, being careful about\ntheir appearance and mentally preparing for insults before they come.\nYou dont have to be a direct victim of a hate crime to be affected by whats going on right now, said Brendan Lantz,\ndirector of the FSU institute. The impact, particularly on mental health, extends so much further beyond being a\nvictim.\nLaw enforcement agencies in the Tampa Bay area have not reported an uptick in hate crimes against Asian\nAmericans. In Florida, its called evidencing prejudice, an add-on charge that increases penalties for crimes\ncommitted against minority groups.\nNationally, a little less than half of Asian respondents to the FSU survey indicated they knew someone personally\nwho had been a victim of a hate crime.\nThe most common type of discrimination faced was verbal insults. Those incidents often go untracked since there\nisnt a crime to report, and Stop AAPI Hate does not have statistics for Tampa Bay specifically. But some locals\nhave stories about the past year.\nA man stepped out of the shadows and blocked the sidewalk in front of two Asian American women walking near\nSt. Petersburgs downtown waterfront in February. Video shows him shouting a racial slur at the women, over and\nover, even after theyd crossed the street in fear.\nIm 32, and this is the first time Id experienced anything like that before in my life, said Amy, a Pinellas County\nnative who requested her last name be withheld, out of fear she could be harassed online. St. Pete is pretty open,\nliberal and friendly. ... When that happened, it felt like it was spreading here.\nA Chinese American real estate agent in Tampa said her car was keyed. An Asian American networking group\ndiscussed over Zoom how people now made an effort to not stand near them in the supermarket, even if it meant\nwaiting in a longer line.\nA Greek restaurant on St. Petersburgs Central Avenue apologized publicly after a misogynistic and racist incident\nwhere outdoor diners threw food at a group of Filipino American women in September.\nWhile the pandemic kept him physically distant from the community, Steve Yang, assistant principal at Tampa Bay\nChinese School, saw Tampa friends post videos of racist street harassment. Then his wife, Angela Ren, came\nhome and said a stranger at Costco in Brandon told her to go back to China.\nIts really upsetting.
