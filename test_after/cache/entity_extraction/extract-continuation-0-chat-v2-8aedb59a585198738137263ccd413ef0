They deserve due recognition and respect and not hate or discrimination,\" said Chinese Consul General in San Francisco Wang Donghua at the forum hosted by Asia Society Northern California on Monday. \nThe root cause for the anti-Asian hate is the racial discrimination against people of color in the US, and the \"fertile ground\" for discrimination and prejudice against Asians is yet to be eradicated, said Wang. The scapegoating of Chinese people for the COVID-19 pandemic by some politicians has exacerbated the hate against Asians, he added. \nHe said it was encouraging that US President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that is aimed at countering the rising anti-Asian hate crimes. \n\"As a member of the Asian consular community, we appreciate the solidarity that California officials have demonstrated against Asian hate. We urge the US federal government and those states who haven't done so to take actions to stop Asian hate, bring perpetrators to justice, ensure the security of all Asians and address the root cause by eradicating the soil for discrimination against Asians and other ethnic groups in the US,\" said Wang. \nLong-existing problem \nCalifornia state Senator Dave Min and Assembly member Phil Ting, both of Asian descent, said anti-Asian racism is a long-existing problem in the US and shared their own stories of growing up in California. \nCalifornia is a state that tends to be more diverse and more receptive to Asian Americans than other parts of the country, but Ting said his upbringing always made him \nfeel like an outsider. \n\"I was always feeling that I was a minority, my parents were immigrants, so I never quite fit in,\" said Ting. He said he didn't understand how to articulate that outsider feeling until he took Asian-American studies at high school. \n\"This is something that was much larger than one individual spewing hate at me as I was growing up. This was something that was part of our societal fabric, that there were laws on the books that created this otherness, that there were structures in place to make sure that there were systemic racist policies that were put forward,\" said Ting, who sees the teaching of Asian-American history and ethnic studies as a solution. \n\"The history of anti-Asian hate and racism is pretty well established in this country. But for those of us who've lived here and grew up here, while we've been accustomed to anti-Asian hate, I think we've been surprised by the depth and breadth and intensity of the anti-Asian hate that has arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Min. \n\"These types of incidents, even if they're not violent, can be deeply unsettling and frightening to those of Asian descent,\" he said. \nAccording to Stop AAPI Hate, from March 2020 to March 2021, the self-reporting platform received 6,603 reports of hate incidents nationwide, and 2,640 of these \nincidents were from California. \n\"If you're not at the table, you're on the menu. I think that's been the case with Asian Americans for too long,\" said Min. \"Without our robust Asian American presence, which we still need to grow, we would not have gotten that kind of attention,\" he said.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ASIA SOCIETY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asia Society Northern California is an organization that hosted a forum addressing anti-Asian racism and promoting solidarity among Asian-American communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WANG DONGHUA<|>PERSON<|>Wang Donghua is the Chinese Consul General in San Francisco who spoke at the forum about the need to combat anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a state in the United States that has a diverse population and is more receptive to Asian Americans compared to other states.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVE MIN<|>PERSON<|>Dave Min is a California state Senator of Asian descent who shared his experiences regarding anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHIL TING<|>PERSON<|>Phil Ting is a California Assembly member of Asian descent who discussed his feelings of being an outsider due to his heritage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that tracks and reports incidents of hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and discrimination in the United States.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WANG DONGHUA<|>ASIA SOCIETY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA<|>Wang Donghua spoke at the forum hosted by Asia Society Northern California to address anti-Asian racism<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVE MIN<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Dave Min is a state Senator representing California and discussed issues of anti-Asian racism in the state<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHIL TING<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Phil Ting is an Assembly member representing California and shared his experiences related to anti-Asian racism<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Stop AAPI Hate reported a rise in hate incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WANG DONGHUA<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Wang Donghua's comments at the forum relate to the issues tracked by Stop AAPI Hate<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVE MIN<|>WANG DONGHUA<|>Dave Min and Wang Donghua both addressed the issue of anti-Asian hate at the forum<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHIL TING<|>WANG DONGHUA<|>Phil Ting and Wang Donghua both spoke about the experiences of Asian Americans and the need to combat racism<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
