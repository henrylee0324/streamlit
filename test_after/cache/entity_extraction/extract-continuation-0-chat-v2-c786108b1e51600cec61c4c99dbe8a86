He posted bail and has been released as he awaits a preliminary hearing. \nHis attorney, Geoffrey Seay, said Figueroa was called to the accident scene at L and Luzerne Streets by his mother or another woman who was in the other vehicle. He declined to comment on the case except to say, \"This isn't a hate crime.\" \nThe takeout's delivery driver, speaking in Mandarin Chinese on Wednesday, said through an interpreter that he, too, was injured. He said that after Lin was punched, the assailant and two other men in the other group pushed him to the ground. He said he was hit in the back, arm, chest, and eye. \nOn Monday, Huynh walked with Yue Xian Wu, the grandmother of the 17-year-old boy who was punched, to the scene of the teen's attack. Wu, speaking in Mandarin Chinese, described how she and her grandson were walking about 7 p.m. Friday on Hawthorne Street near Friendship, next to Mayfair Elementary School, when two teens, about 17 or 18 years old, ran toward her grandson and punched him in the face, ear, and back. \nA girl around the same age came over and started laughing, then left with the two assailants, Wu said. \n\"She feel like they treat us like a toy, like an entertainment and hit us for fun, for a game,\" Huynh said of Wu, interpreting for her. \"She feel like Asians don't report to the police and don't speak English,\" making them an \"easy target.\" \nWu's grandson, Yuheng Chen, suffered a bloody nose, bruises on his right ear, temporary dizziness, and various cuts. But he didn't seek medical treatment. Speaking at the home he shares with his grandmother, he brushed off the incident, saying he didn't want to bother people. Although he initially reported the attack, he expressed reluctance about following up with police about it. \"I don't want other people to feel I'm sad,\" he said. \n\"This is not normal,\" Huynh told Chen. \"This is not right. That's why I'm fighting. ... If we don't stand up for ourselves, the police cannot help. They can only do so much.... You'll only be a victim if you continue to be like, 'Oh, they hit me, that's OK.' If anyone hit me like that, I will yell.
