[and] issuesregardingracialinjustice. All that put together made last year very different from other years, said Austin Chiang, a doctor whose parents emigrated from Taiwan to the U.S. 10 years before he was born in Irvine, California.\nOn the same day that six Asian American women were slain with two other individuals in Atlanta last week, the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate released a report that cited 3,795 hate incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021.\nMore than 500 of the incidents were recorded since the beginning of this year.\nCOVID-19 was first detected in humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Spreading globally since then, it has felled more than 548,000 people in the U.S., where there have been more than 30 million confirmed cases, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.\nIn 16 of the most populous U.S. cities, attacks on Asian Americans increased in 2020 by almost 150% over the previous year, according to data compiled by California State University's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.\nThat has made the past year a time of reflection for Chiang, who holds a master's degree in public health from Harvard University and an M.D. from Columbia University He has been active on social media countering COVID-19 misinformationas the chief medical social media officer for 14 hospitals operated by Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and founder of the Association for Healthcare Social Media (AHSM).\nThe death of George Floyd, an African American man who died while in police custody in May in Minnesota, and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, mademerethink a lot of things about... ways we can try to incorporate...equity around my workplace and making surethat othersfeel like they are treated fairly and are seen and heard, the gastroenterologist told VOA Mandarin.\nIt's definitely been jarring and a bit hard to reconcile because at the same time feeling ... we're being judged not for our skill but for our appearance, and certainly that's something that affects so many different people.\nThe funniest thing was a Caucasian gentleman called me, like, 'Eggrolls,' said VannthathMan, 42, of Haymarket, Virginia, an ICU nurse at Inova Fairfax Hospital who studied nursing at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.\nI don't take these things personally ... He may have that thought in the back of his mind but if he was not medicated, if he was not confused, he would not have said it.But it doesn't make him right to think that way.\nBorn in Battambang, Cambodia, Man was bullied to tears and outcast during his first years of school after he arrived in the U.S. in 1989 at the age of 12 with his family. At the time, Man told VOA Khmer he thought it might be a good idea if someone were to help ...maybe I wouldn't have the suicidal thoughts, maybe I didn't have to go through such a hard time. So that's why I went into the help industry or (became) a nurse because I want to help people.\nOn a day when four of his six COVID-19 patients died in the ICU, Man turned to the self-care methods created for himself as a teen. Culturally, our family (was) not very open on talking about certain things. ... A lot of time (I dealt) with things by myself. ... So with that day, I thought ... about what positive attributes you have, what positive things you give to the community.\nAsians, U.S.- and Asian-born combined, are disproportionately represented in health care given their numbers in the overall population, according to figures from the Migration Policy Institute and the U.S. Census.\nOf the foreign-born health care workers in the U.S., 40% come from Asia.\nAfter learning English, he enrolled in an accelerated nursing program at Chamberlain University in Downers Grove, Illinois, condensing four years of study into 30 months. He graduated in 2017 with a bachelor's degree.\nIt was tough, Conners told VOA Indonesia of his intense program. Now an ICU nurse in the hospital where he returned to health, he treats African Americans,Hispanics,Asians, Middle Easterners, Caucasians, everyone the same. They are my patients.\nHis first COVID-19 patients were in their70s and 80s, but now they are younger people, in their 20s and 30s.\nIt's really sad. It's really depressing, Connors said. And when I go out from work,when I (leave) work, I see people in the street outside ... not wearing masks orthey're just not doing social distancing. ... it (breaks) my heart.\nIf only those on the street could see inside of this hospital, people ... dying, said Conners, who would like to return to Indonesia to work with a local clinic, buildan outpatient clinicand try to help my people.\nNursing during the pandemic has taught Conners the value of self-care, which includes taking care of my mind, my mentalwell-being, said Conners, who estimates he has witnessed 100 patients die from COVID-19. Sometimes I feel likeCOVIDjust beat me. ... OrI feel like I just lost in a battle withCOVID.\nWengang Zhang, 67, was born in China's\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUSTIN
