That's how I feel right now as an old immigrant, as an American.\"\nEmployees newly wary of taking public transportation to work are shifting their hours, asking not to come in early or work late - fearful of what they may encounter along their commute in light of viral videos of Asian pedestrians being violently assaulted.\n\"We have to start quantifying the economic effect of hate,\" Heystek said. \"We cannot ignore this grave threat to our economy.\"\nResentment against Asian Americans has long existed in this country. They've been a frequent scapegoat during economic woes and disease outbreaks, and in wartime propaganda. Racist incidents today are more easily recorded on smartphones and shared over social media, contributing to increased fear.\nThere is no comprehensive data measuring anti-Asian hate crimes during the coronavirus pandemic. One in 3 female Asian American business owners reported experiencing anti-Asian sentiment, according to a 2020 survey by minority business organizations.\nA recent analysis of self-reported incidents by Russell Jeung, chairman of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University, who is studying racism and xenophobia during the pandemic, shows at least 3,800 cases of harassment and assault against Asians since March 2020, with more than twice as many women as men saying they have been mistreated. Most incidents, experts say, are never reported to law enforcement.\nImmigrant business owners whose instinct is not to report racial harassment to police are instead seeking help from culturally aligned organizations like ASIAN Inc.\n\"What they are saying is, 'I'm fearful of opening my doors to the public. I don't want to put my workers in harm's way. If they can hurt a shop in Atlanta, what prevents them from hurting a shop in San Francisco?'\" Heystek said. \"Folks have got to feel empowered to do business in this climate.\"\nIn response, Asian American organizations are helping small-business owners secure funding to install security cameras that record video and audio, distribute personal security alarms to employees that can be programmed to call 911, and connect them with self-defense training.\nThe National Asian/Pacific Islander American Chamber of Commerce and Entrepreneurship held an emergency Zoom meeting last week to discuss anti-Asian hate and the Atlanta shootings that drew more than four dozen business leaders.\n\"There are two illnesses attacking AAPI small businesses: One is covid. The other is hate,\" said Chiling Tong, president and chief executive of the national chamber, who has been fielding calls and emails from around the country from businesses seeking guidance. \"They are just very scared to operate, especially after the attacks in Atlanta.\"\nGeri Guidote Hernandez, the Filipina American owner of Savory Crust, an empanada carryout in a Chicago-area ethnic strip mall, said the attacks compelled her this week to draw up an emergency active-shooter plan for her employees, who include her two daughters.\n\"Growing up, anytime we felt racism, what do our parents say? 'Just ignore that.' So we do it over our whole lifetime,\" she said. \"It's a different environment now.\"\nIn Southern California, the Orange County Human Relations Commission, which has tracked hate incidents since 1995, recorded a tenfold increase of incidents targeting Asian Americans in 2020 from prior years.\nOn Tuesday, a Vietnamese American-owned beauty school in Orange County, where a fifth of the population is Asian, hosted a self-defense workshop for salon and spa workers. Tam Nguyen, president of Advance Beauty College, started 34 years ago by his parents, said he plans to also offer workshops on de-escalation, safe confrontation and the use of Mace. He and other nail-care industry leaders are distributing cards and fliers listing newly created police hotlines for reporting hate crimes in Vietnamese and Korean. And businesses are chipping in for private security guards to patrol Asian shopping plazas.\nIn Sacramento, Kelly Shum, owner of Mad Butcher Meat Co., said she started spending $5,000 a month for a security guard after a customer last spring tried to attack her younger sister, who was enforcing the mask policy at the door. Shum said she had called police but that they never responded. So she stepped in with a baseball bat to get the man to leave.\nThe Sacramento Police Department said it has no record of a call from Shum's business at the time of the incident.\nThe 28-year-old entrepreneur said she felt she had little choice but to incur the extra expense to protect her employees, nearly all of whom are Chinese and Vietnamese immigrant women. Three of them have quit out of fear.\n\"Having a security guard is extreme just to fight off racists,\" Shum said. But \"so many customers are calling us 'coronavirus,' 'China virus' and saying, 'Why should I be wearing a mask if you people are the dirty ones?'\n\"No one feels safe. No one wants to come to work,\" she said. The security guard \"is literally only here so we can do our job.\"\nBut that did not stop a car from waiting in the parking lot for her father to leave the shop and tailing him, according to footage from a security camera. Her sister, who was also driving home in a separate car, told Shum that the car tried to run their father off the road.\nIn February, a customer left a mutilated cat in their parking lot, invoking a racist stereotype of Asians. Shum said her lone White employee volunteered to dispose of the carcass, aware of the implications of an Asian American being seen discarding the animal.\n\"All of us knew what it meant and understood the gravity of the situation. This was a very obvious hate crime,\" Shum said.\nWhen she posted about the incident on social media, Shum was aghast that some users defended the man who left the cat. \"People were like\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
