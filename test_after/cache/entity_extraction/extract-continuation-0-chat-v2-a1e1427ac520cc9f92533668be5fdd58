Ninety percent of them were Asian people mentioning the shooting or racial trauma.\nThe calls came not just from L.A. or across California, but also from Alabama, Kansas and even Georgia, with desperate requests for an Asian therapist who could help them cope.\nThe out-of-state inquiries were not new for Yoon, who started the Yellow Chair Collective with a partner in 2019. But due to overwhelming demand and licensing restrictions that limit practitioners' ability to treat people in other states, Yoon and her fellow therapists felt a sense of helplessness, realizing they could not serve everyone.\n\"We've been getting a lot more inquiries than we could accommodate,\" Yoon said. \"We've been getting a lot of inquiries out of state where they don't have a lot of Asian providers and that's been hard ... we had to turn some Asian clients away.\"\nThe Atlanta-area shootings amplified the longtime mental health crisis in Asian American and Pacific Islander communities after a year of anti-Asian violence and grief over COVID-19 deaths.\nExperts and advocates say these events also helped expose other shortcomings in the healthcare system particular to Asian Americans, including a lack of Asian mental health providers, ongoing language barriers and ignorance of Asian culture, histories and the decades of violence they've faced in America.\nDuring the pandemic, Asian communities are also dealing with displacement from loss of income or the need to move, being without usual support systems because of social distancing and fear of violence inspired by bigoted rhetoric that Asian people are responsible for the coronavirus.\n\"It's just making a lot of mental health challenges worse,\" said Mandy Diec, California policy director for the Washington, D.C.-based Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. \"It's really nothing new, but it's something reinforcing a lot of the trauma and it's unfortunate that the biggest problem is that we live in a healthcare system that doesn't account for the needs of our community.\"\nDepression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, unresolved trauma and cultural stigma about mental illness are longtime concerns in Asian communities.\nNearly 44% of Asian Americans who had a past-year major depressive episode received treatment for it, according to the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Refugees from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam are most at risk for PTSD from the traumas of genocide, war and assimilation to resettlement in the U.S., according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nA report released last week by the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center found that 29% of respondents faced challenges due to an insufficient understanding of mental health services and how to navigate the mental health system.\nSurvey participants said they care most about someone understanding their cultural values, roles and expectations, a welcoming environment and an understanding of their community's history.\nDiec said younger generations are \"cultural brokers\" between older adults and the mental health system, helping them make appointments, research therapists and receive care.\nShe said Asian American and Pacific Islander communities revolve around family and the collective community, making mental health -- often treated individually -- a challenging subject to broach because it's not seen as \"necessary or really worthy of talking about.\"\nIn 2019, there were 4,887 Asian psychologists across the U.S., making up just 4% of the workforce, according to a report from the American Psychological Assn.\nYoon had to find a therapist for her mom in 2019 when she was experiencing depression.\nHer mother speaks Korean and finding a therapist in San Diego who speaks the same language was challenging. Given her background, Yoon said she did the therapist consultations and made the appointments.\nYoon said it's common to see young Asian people asking for a consultation or making appointments on behalf of their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles.\n\"Because of their generation, therapy wasn't even an option, they didn't think about it,\" Yoon said. \"They're still hesitant, so younger people are trying to bring that idea to their parents.\"\nTo meet the increased need of the community, Yoon and her staff initially offered two free support groups after the Atlanta-area shootings. They filled up quickly. The practice is hosting a workshop for Asian parents on how to talk about anti-Asian racism with their children and a support group for Asian American teens.\nThey're also offering coaching group services on topics such as \"How to find your voice as an Asian American\" and \"How to advocate for yourself and your community.\"\nBut Yoon says her Asian clients are struggling to process what happened in the Atlanta area and the attacks that have long occurred in their communities.\nOften they've been told by older generations to ignore the racist attacks, work harder and \"don't rock the boat,\" Yoon said. Now they're trying to find the words to explain the traumas of feeling culturally and emotionally invisible. Her female clients are feeling especially isolated.\n\"A lot of them were telling me that a lot of companies didn't acknowledge what happened,\" Yoon said of her clients. \"They're feeling the tragedy but their companies, their own managers, are going like it's just a normal day and that was on St. Patrick's Day so people were celebrating ... they're really struggling, and they feel like they want to cry and it's like, 'OK, when I go to therapy, I can cry.' \"\nKate Wadsworth, clinical director for the Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants in Oakland, worried how the Atlanta-area shootings would trigger PTSD among her Southeast Asian clients.\nDuring the pandemic, the organization has held virtual sessions four times a week to talk about how people are coping with\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LINDA YOON<|>PERSON<|>Linda Yoon is a Korean American psychotherapist who started the Yellow Chair Collective and has been receiving increased inquiries from clients after the Atlanta-area spa shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YELLOW CHAIR COLLECTIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Yellow Chair Collective is a practice founded by Linda Yoon that provides therapy services, particularly to the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA-AREA SPA SHOOTINGS<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta-area spa shootings refer to a tragic incident where eight people were killed, including six Asian women, leading to increased demand for mental health services among the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHEAST ASIA RESOURCE ACTION CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Southeast Asia Resource Action Center is an organization that focuses on the needs and challenges faced by Southeast Asian communities, particularly in mental health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANDY DIEC<|>PERSON<|>Mandy Diec is the California policy director for the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, advocating for the mental health needs of Asian American communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a state in the U.S. where Linda Yoon's practice is located and where many inquiries for therapy services have been received.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a pandemic that has exacerbated mental health issues in Asian communities, contributing to feelings of isolation and trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN DIEGO<|>GEO<|>San Diego is a city in California where Linda Yoon sought a therapist for her mother who speaks Korean.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAKLAND<|>GEO<|>Oakland is a city in California where the Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants is located, which provides support to Southeast Asian clients.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR EMPOWERING REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants is an organization in Oakland that supports refugees and immigrants, particularly in mental health.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINDA YOON<|>YELLOW CHAIR COLLECTIVE<|>Linda Yoon is the founder of the Yellow Chair Collective, which provides therapy services to the community<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA-AREA SPA SHOOTINGS<|>YELLOW CHAIR COLLECTIVE<|>The Atlanta-area spa shootings led to an increase in demand for therapy services at the Yellow Chair Collective<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDY DIEC<|>SOUTHEAST ASIA RESOURCE ACTION CENTER<|>Mandy Diec is the California policy director for the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, advocating for mental health needs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTHEAST ASIA RESOURCE ACTION CENTER<|>ATLANTA-AREA SPA SHOOTINGS<|>The Southeast Asia Resource Action Center addresses the mental health crisis exacerbated by the Atlanta-area spa shootings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINDA YOON<|>MANDY DIEC<|>Linda Yoon and Mandy Diec are both involved in addressing mental health issues in the Asian community<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>SOUTHEAST ASIA RESOURCE ACTION CENTER<|>COVID-19 has impacted the mental health of Asian communities, which the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center aims to address<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINDA YOON<|>SAN DIEGO<|>Linda Yoon sought a therapist for her mother in San Diego, highlighting the challenges of finding culturally competent care<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTER FOR EMPOWERING REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS<|>OAKLAND<|>The Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants is located in Oakland and provides support to Southeast Asian clients<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
