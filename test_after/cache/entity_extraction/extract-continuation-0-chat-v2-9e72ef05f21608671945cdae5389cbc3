But after the pandemic and all the hate crime going on, there are more Asians buying guns to defend themselves,\" Jimmy Gong, the owner of New York-based Jimmy's Sport Shop, was quoted as saying in the Forbes report.\nDuring the pandemic, gun sales have doubled for Gong. About half of his business derives from Asian Americans, who also buy a lot of pepper spray, he told the outlet.\nAccording to the report, gun stores across the US are also seeing an increasing number of Asian Americans purchasing firearms for self-defense purposes. Poway Weapons & Gear in California saw a 20% increase in Asian American first-time buyers over the past year compared with the year before that, said Danielle Jaymes, the store's general manager.\nSix of the eight people killed in the Atlanta shootings on Tuesday were Asian women, although no motive for the shootings has been established. Robert Aaron Long, 21, has been named by police as the suspect in all eight deaths, which took place at spas. He was arrested after a car chase south of Atlanta in Crisp County, around 150 miles away.\nA recent analysis found hate crimes against Asian Americans rose nearly 150% in 2020. President Joe Biden addressed the spike in a televised broadcast on Friday, labeling it \"un-American\" and insisted that \"it must stop.\"\nThough police officers have ramped up patrols in Asian American communities to try and safeguard against attacks, many people are still choosing to take defense into their own hands, The New York Post reported.\nAs Anti-Asian rhetoric increased during the pandemic, former President Donald Trump was criticised for referring to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus.\" The World Health Organization has urged people not to use that term, along with several others.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are individuals of Asian descent living in the United States, who have increasingly purchased firearms for self-defense amid rising hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIMMY GONG<|>PERSON<|>Jimmy Gong is the owner of Jimmy's Sport Shop in New York, which has seen a rise in firearm sales to Asian Americans during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIMMY'S SPORT SHOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Jimmy's Sport Shop is a firearm retail store in New York that caters to a growing number of Asian American customers seeking self-defense weapons.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWAY WEAPONS & GEAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Poway Weapons & Gear is a firearm retail store in California that reported a 20% increase in Asian American first-time buyers over the past year.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA SHOOTINGS<|>EVENT<|>The Atlanta shootings refer to a tragic event where eight people, six of whom were Asian women, were killed at spas, raising concerns about hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>PERSON<|>Robert Aaron Long is the 21-year-old suspect arrested in connection with the Atlanta shootings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States who addressed the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, labeling it \"un-American.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States who faced criticism for referring to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus,\" contributing to anti-Asian sentiment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has led to increased hate crimes against Asian Americans and a rise in firearm purchases for self-defense.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JIMMY GONG<|>JIMMY'S SPORT SHOP<|>Jimmy Gong's store has seen a significant increase in firearm sales to Asian Americans during the pandemic, reflecting a trend in self-defense purchases<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>JIMMY'S SPORT SHOP<|>Asian Americans are increasingly purchasing firearms from Jimmy's Sport Shop for self-defense against hate crimes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>POWAY WEAPONS & GEAR<|>Asian Americans are also buying firearms from Poway Weapons & Gear, indicating a broader trend across the US<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA SHOOTINGS<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The Atlanta shootings highlighted the vulnerability of Asian Americans and the rise in hate crimes against them<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>ATLANTA SHOOTINGS<|>Robert Aaron Long is the suspect in the Atlanta shootings, which involved multiple Asian American victims<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Joe Biden addressed the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, emphasizing the need for action<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric during the pandemic has been linked to increased anti-Asian sentiment and hate crimes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a catalyst for increased hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
