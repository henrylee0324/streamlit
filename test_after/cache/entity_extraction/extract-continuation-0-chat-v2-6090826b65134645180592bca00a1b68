Brooklyn Center erupted in protests this week during the already tense environment surrounding the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd last May. \n\"We have a crisis, an epidemic of Black people dying at the hands of law enforcement, this is a terrible issue in Minnesota but it's a national issue,\" Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith told MinnPost. \"We have to look systematically at the criminal justice system and policing.\" \nSmith has been outspoken on the issue of race and policing in Minnesota, appearing on national news outlets like Good Morning America to condemn the \"epidemic\" of Black people being killed by law enforcement in Minnesota. \n\"This isn't only about criminal justice and policing,\" Smith said. \"It's also about all of the systems that we need to change so that everybody has a fair shot.\" \nAgainst the backdrop of pain and unrest in Minnesota, there are several bills that address racial injustice moving through Congress right now. Democrats on Capitol Hill, boosted by President Joe Biden's day-one emphasis on addressing racial disparities and newly won control of the Senate, however slight, are taking action. Here are four areas where Congress is addressing racial equity: \nThe COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act \nIn the wake of a mass shooting in Georgia that appeared to target Asian women and numerous attacks on Asian Americans since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers introduced the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. \nOn Wednesday, the Senate voted 92-6 in favor of proceeding to consider the bill. Under the terms of that bill, the Attorney General would be instructed to assign a Department of Justice employee to review COVID-19 related hate crimes, including attacks on people based on the assumption that their race, gender, or sexuality links them to the spread of the virus. \nThe six senators who voted against considering the bill were Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. \nReparations \nThe House Judiciary Committee voted to bring a reparations bill in front of the full chamber. Despite this victory for Democrats, the reparations bill labeled H.R. 40 after the Civil War-era unfulfilled promise to give former slaves \"40 acres and a mule\" - faces steep odds of passing into law. \nThe legislation would create a federal commission to examine slavery and discrimination in the U.S. from 1619 to present in order to recommend ways the government could offer a formal apology and what types of redress and repair could be offered to descendants of slaves in America, including reparations - payments to people who have been wronged in some way by the U.S. government. \nNow, as the country grapples with systemic racism laid bare by the recent police killing of Daunte Wright and last year of George Floyd, the measure has drawn support from powerful Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and President Biden. But the bill has faced unified opposition from Republicans and dissent from some Democrats. \nThe House Judiciary Committee voted to bring H.R. 40 out of committee Wednesday, a major milestone for the bill that has not been accomplished since the first reparations bill was introduced in 1989. Every Congress since then has considered the legislation, but the bill never made it past a committee vote until Wednesday. \nMinnesota Rep. Michelle Fischbach, a member of the Judiciary Committee, voted against the bill Wednesday. \nD.C. Statehood \nThe House Oversight Committee on Wednesday advanced legislation that would make Washington, D.C. the 51st state, giving the 700,000 District residents representation in the House and Senate. \nThe District's population has historically been predominantly black, and with the 2017 Census reporting that 47.7% of D.C. residents are Black or African American, if it were to become a state it would be more heavily Black than any state in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union calls D.C. statehood \"a racial justice issue,\" saying that statehood for the District would \"correct an overt act of racial voter suppression with roots in the Reconstruction era.\" \n\"It's no accident that Washington, D.C. is a majority community of color and yet these folks' voices don't have a vote in Congress, and that is wrong and it needs to be repaired,\" Sen. Smith said. \"Washington, D.C. is roughly the size of two Minnesota Congressional districts, so why would it be fair that Minnesotans in two Congressional districts wouldn't have representation? There's no justification for that.\" \nThe Oversight Committee passing this bill sets the stage for a vote by the full House for the second year in a row. Statehood for the District is a Democratic priority that will likely clear the House along party lines like it did last year. Though Democrats tout the bill as a way to protect voting rights and promote racial justice, there's a political strategy as well: A city that voted 92% in favor of Biden in the 2020 election will likely be a reliable Democratic vote, giving the party two more Senate seats if the district were to become a state. \nThe bill will face an uphill battle in the Senate where it will need 60 votes to pass, and where Republicans aren't likely to be on board. \nNew Civil Rights Division head \nSenate Democrats in the Judiciary Committee this week advanced President Biden's nomination for the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, Kristen Clarke, who if confirmed would be the first Senate-confirmed Black woman leader of the division. \nAs head of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KIM POTTER<|>PERSON<|>Kim Potter is a former police officer involved in the shooting of Daunte Wright during a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAUNTE WRIGHT<|>PERSON<|>Daunte Wright was shot and killed by former police officer Kim Potter during a traffic stop.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEREK CHAUVIN<|>PERSON<|>Derek Chauvin is a former Minneapolis police officer on trial for the murder of George Floyd.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>PERSON<|>George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis, sparking nationwide protests against racial injustice.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TINA SMITH<|>PERSON<|>Tina Smith is a Minnesota Senator advocating for racial justice and reform in policing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINNESOTA<|>GEO<|>Minnesota is a U.S. state where significant events related to racial justice and police violence have occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act is legislation introduced to address hate crimes related to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>H.R. 40<|>EVENT<|>H.R. 40 is a reparations bill aimed at addressing the historical injustices of slavery in the U.S.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>GEO<|>Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United States, currently seeking statehood to enhance representation for its residents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NANCY PELOSI<|>PERSON<|>Nancy Pelosi is the House Speaker supporting the reparations bill H.R. 40.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHUCK SCHUMER<|>PERSON<|>Chuck Schumer is the Majority Leader in the Senate supporting the reparations bill H.R. 40.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the President of the United States advocating for racial equity and supporting the reparations bill H.R. 40.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISTEN CLARKE<|>PERSON<|>Kristen Clarke is President Biden's nominee for the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIM POTTER<|>DAUNTE WRIGHT<|>Kim Potter shot and killed Daunte Wright during a traffic stop, leading to protests and discussions on racial justice.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEREK CHAUVIN<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>Derek Chauvin is on trial for the murder of George Floyd, which has become a pivotal case in the discussion of police violence and racial injustice.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TINA SMITH<|>MINNESOTA<|>Tina Smith is a Senator from Minnesota advocating for racial justice reforms in the state, particularly in response to police violence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MINNESOTA<|>KIM POTTER<|>The incident involving Kim Potter and Daunte Wright occurred in Minnesota, highlighting issues of policing and racial justice in the state.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>H.R. 40<|>NANCY PELOSI<|>Nancy Pelosi supports the reparations bill H.R. 40, which aims to address historical injustices related to slavery.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>H.R. 40<|>JOE BIDEN<|>Joe Biden supports the reparations bill H.R. 40 as part of his administration's focus on racial equity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>H.R. 40<|>CHUCK SCHUMER<|>Chuck Schumer supports the reparations bill H.R. 40, advocating for its passage in the Senate.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>MINNESOTA<|>Both Washington, D.C. and Minnesota are involved in discussions about racial justice and representation, particularly in the context of statehood and voting rights.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISTEN CLARKE<|>JOE BIDEN<|>Kristen Clarke is nominated by Joe Biden to lead the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, indicating a focus on civil rights issues.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
