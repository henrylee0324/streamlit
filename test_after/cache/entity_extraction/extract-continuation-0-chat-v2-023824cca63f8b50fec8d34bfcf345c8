But microaggressions - small or subconscious instances of prejudice and racism and verbal attacks are common, according to Wu. \nâ€” \nIt comes down to this, Clemson senior Kenneth Sloane said: It's not so much, \"we're better than you... it's more like, 'why are you here?\"\" \nSloane said the pandemic - which originated in China - has allowed people to \"attach certain catchphrases or terms\" to the rhetoric of anti-Asian racism. \n\"People don't say it out loud as much, but I think this pandemic has really given people ways to speak on that or act on that kind of bias that they maybe didn't have in the past,\" Sloane, who is white and Japanese, said. \nRise in violence leads to Upstate activism \nA 15-year-old white teenager from Oconee County is among the dozen or so people banding together to stop the xenophobia in Upstate South Carolina. \nHayden Laye, a high school student from Walhalla, created Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC with about a dozen other activists to promote awareness to the rise in racism and work to end the anti-Asian rhetoric in local communities. \n\"We don't have a lot of Asian people in Oconee County or in the Upstate, but it's just that, even if you don't see it, we know what's going on,\" Laye said. Oconee County's population is less than 1% Asian and the state has an Asian American population of 1.8%, according to the U.S. Census. \n\"And we need to help people where it is happening, or even if it's just happening online or to those few people in Oconee County,\" Laye added. \nStop Asian Hate Upstate SC is planning to hold rallies across the Upstate in the coming weeks, Laye said. One is tentatively planned for downtown Greenville on April 24. \nThe group is a mix of Democrats, Black Lives Matter and Dreamer activists, Laye said. Wu, the Chinese veteran, is also tied to the \ngroup. \n\"It's people from all across the Upstate coming together and across the country to work to end racism.\" \nAlthough the group is run by many non-Asians, Wu said he hopes that by putting his story out there, it spurs dialogues and helps other Asian Americans speak out. \n\"In the past, we as Asian Americans were more likely to just lower our heads and then try to do our hard work to prove ourselves. But right now, I do believe that we need to do both, we need to continue to do hard work and also put our stories out there.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a nonprofit organization aimed at curbing hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMMY CROSBY<|>PERSON<|>Tommy Crosby is a spokesperson for the State Law Enforcement Division, providing information on hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KENNETH SLOANE<|>PERSON<|>Kenneth Sloane is a Clemson senior who discusses the impact of the pandemic on anti-Asian racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAYDEN LAYE<|>PERSON<|>Hayden Laye is a high school student from Walhalla who created Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC to promote awareness of racism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UPSTATE SOUTH CAROLINA<|>GEO<|>Upstate South Carolina is the region where activism against xenophobia is taking place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREENVILLE<|>GEO<|>Greenville is a city in South Carolina where a rally is tentatively planned to be held.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP ASIAN HATE UPSTATE SC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC is a group formed by activists to raise awareness and combat anti-Asian racism in local communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WU<|>PERSON<|>Wu is a Chinese veteran involved with the Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC group, advocating for dialogue and awareness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black Lives Matter is a movement that advocates for racial justice and is part of the coalition in the Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC group.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DREAMER ACTIVISTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dreamer activists are individuals advocating for the rights of undocumented immigrants, also part of the coalition in the Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC group.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAYDEN LAYE<|>STOP ASIAN HATE UPSTATE SC<|>Hayden Laye created Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC to promote awareness of racism and xenophobia<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>STOP ASIAN HATE UPSTATE SC<|>Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC is inspired by the mission of Stop AAPI Hate to combat hate crimes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KENNETH SLOANE<|>UPSTATE SOUTH CAROLINA<|>Kenneth Sloane discusses the impact of anti-Asian racism in Upstate South Carolina<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WU<|>STOP ASIAN HATE UPSTATE SC<|>Wu is involved with Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC, sharing his story to encourage dialogue<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WU<|>BLACK LIVES MATTER<|>Wu is part of a coalition that includes Black Lives Matter activists working against racism<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WU<|>DREAMER ACTIVISTS<|>Wu collaborates with Dreamer activists in the Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAYDEN LAYE<|>GREENVILLE<|>Hayden Laye is planning a rally in Greenville to raise awareness against racism<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOMMY CROSBY<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>Tommy Crosby provides information on hate crimes relevant to the mission of Stop AAPI Hate<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
