But inside Mandy Lin's apartment in Philadelphia's Chinatown neighborhood the lockdown drags on. \nHer 9-year-old son is struggling through the last lessons of fourth grade on a laptop while many of his classmates are back in school. His grandmother stays inside all day. For exercise Ms. Lin's family paces their building's parking lot or ventures to a nearby park. \nBut it is not Covid-19 keeping the family from rejoining a bustling world of restaurants schools and public spaces. \n\"It's not safe to be outside\" Ms. Lin 43 said. \"There has just been unending violence and harassment.\" \nA surge in anti-Asian attacks during the pandemic is now holding back many Asian American families from joining the rest of the country in getting back to normal. \nAs schools phase out remote learning companies summon employees back to work and masks fly off people's faces Asian Americans say that America's race to reopen is creating a new wave of worries - not about getting sick but whether they will be attacked if they venture back onto a bus or accosted if they return to a favorite cafe or bookstore. \nIn more than a dozen interviews across the country Asian Americans detailed fears about their safety and a litany of precautions that have endured even as the country has reopened. Some people are still avoiding subways and public transportation. Others are staying away from restaurants. Some dread the return of business travel or the end of remote work. \nTheir fears come as attacks continue. Stop AAPI Hate a coalition of community and academic organizations tracked more than 6600 attacks and other incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from March 2020 to March 2021. A survey this spring found that one in three Asian Americans worried about becoming victims of hate crimes. And while nearly three-fifths of white fourth graders are now back in class just 18 percent of their Asian American peers have returned to in-person learning according to federal surveys. \nAsian Americans said they hoped the threats would ebb as more people got vaccinated and the pandemic faded. But person after person echoed the same worry: There is no vaccine against bigotry.\nIt's embedded itself so deeply\" said Lily Zhu 30 a tech worker in Pflugerville Texas. \"When we got our Covid shots it was marking the end of this weird year where everyone was frozen in time. But there's still this paranoia.\" \nMs. Zhu is fully vaccinated but says she no longer takes the bus and does not know if she will ever again ride on it alone. As she ventures back into public spaces she feels more comfortable at Asian markets like H Mart or the 99 Ranch Market in Austin. \nShe worries about her parents in Ohio who have gone back to commuting and taking art classes in downtown Cleveland and who now own a gun for protection. They messaged Ms. Zhu with concern after six women of Asian descent were among eight people shot to death at massage spas around Atlanta in March -- killings that galvanized many Asian Americans to demand political action to address the spike in anti-Asian violence. \nIn Philadelphia Ms. Lin is rattled by the stories of violence and verbal assaults against Asian Americans that pop into her WeChat groups: A pregnant woman who was punched in the face. A 64-year-old man attacked not far from the Lin family's apartment by someone shouting anti-Asian epithets. A 27-year-old woman hit in the head without any warning or provocation. \nMs. Lin said her family had hewed to the same guarded routine even as Philadelphia had celebrated the decline in coronavirus cases by ending capacity limits on businesses and announcing a return to full-time in-person school next autumn. \nShe shops for food at nearby markets in Chinatown. Her husband brings home anything else they need from his supermarket job. And every school day she sits beside her 9-year-old son who has autism to help him with his virtual classes. \nMs. Lin is afraid he is falling further behind by not being around other students but she has deep concerns about sending him back: His safety. The two-mile trip to his school. The fact that he cannot yet get vaccinated. \nThe disparities in returning to school have become a particularly urgent concern for groups representing Asian American parents. They worry what will happen next year if their children continue to feel unsafe. The Education Department recently put out a guide for families dealing with anti-Asian bullying and reminded schools that they have a legal obligation to confront the harassment.\nBut it has not been enough for Ms. Lin. Not yet. \n\"I feel really conflicted about what to do to support my child\" she said. \nAnna Perng a community organizer in Philadelphia who has spent the past year calling out anti-Asian hate and getting people vaccinated said she struggled to persuade some wary Chinese American families to attend the city's annual flower show at FDR Park last weekend. \nIt is a huge event in a neighborhood that is miles from Chinatown and an anxious step for families who still feel threatened Ms. Perng said. She had gotten discounted tickets and arranged a Zoom chat beforehand to answer their questions. High on the list: What should they do if they felt unsafe and needed to leave in a hurry?\n\"We are going to have to work hard to help targeted communities feel safe\" she said. \nMany people said they were trying to strike a balance that lets them feel comfortable as much as they can in public. It can be an agonizing calibration just to take a walk: Will wearing a mask act as a shield or attract unwanted attention? Is daytime safer than night? Are largely Asian neighborhoods safer or more likely to be attacked? \nMany residents have also called on the police to increase patrols and some communities have started their own\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MANDY LIN<|>PERSON<|>Mandy Lin is a resident of Philadelphia's Chinatown, concerned for her family's safety during the pandemic and the rise in anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHILADELPHIA<|>GEO<|>Philadelphia is a city in Pennsylvania where Mandy Lin resides, particularly in the Chinatown neighborhood.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN<|>GEO<|>Chinatown is a neighborhood in Philadelphia known for its Asian American community and cultural significance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>H MART<|>ORGANIZATION<|>H Mart is an Asian supermarket chain where Lily Zhu feels more comfortable shopping.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>99 RANCH MARKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>99 Ranch Market is another Asian supermarket where Lily Zhu prefers to shop.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LILY ZHU<|>PERSON<|>Lily Zhu is a tech worker in Pflugerville, Texas, who expresses concerns about safety in public spaces due to anti-Asian violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OHIO<|>GEO<|>Ohio is the state where Lily Zhu's parents live and have resumed commuting and taking art classes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLEVELAND<|>GEO<|>Cleveland is a city in Ohio where Lily Zhu's parents are taking art classes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FDR PARK<|>GEO<|>FDR Park is a location in Philadelphia where the city's annual flower show takes place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNA PERNG<|>PERSON<|>Anna Perng is a community organizer in Philadelphia focused on addressing anti-Asian hate and promoting vaccinations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a coalition that tracks incidents of anti-Asian violence and advocates for the Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is the pandemic that has affected public health and safety, leading to increased anti-Asian sentiment and violence.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDY LIN<|>PHILADELPHIA<|>Mandy Lin lives in Philadelphia's Chinatown and is affected by the city's social climate regarding safety and anti-Asian violence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LILY ZHU<|>OHIO<|>Lily Zhu's parents live in Ohio and have resumed their daily activities, which concerns her due to safety issues.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LILY ZHU<|>CLEVELAND<|>Lily Zhu's parents are taking art classes in Cleveland, Ohio, which is part of their routine.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDY LIN<|>CHINATOWN<|>Mandy Lin resides in Chinatown, which is significant to her family's cultural identity and safety concerns.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LILY ZHU<|>H MART<|>Lily Zhu prefers shopping at H Mart, feeling safer in Asian markets compared to other public spaces.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LILY ZHU<|>99 RANCH MARKET<|>Lily Zhu also shops at 99 Ranch Market, indicating her preference for Asian grocery stores.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANNA PERNG<|>FDR PARK<|>Anna Perng organized efforts to encourage attendance at the annual flower show at FDR Park, addressing community safety concerns.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>COVID-19<|>Stop AAPI Hate tracks incidents of violence that have surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the impact of the health crisis on Asian Americans.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDY LIN<|>LILY ZHU<|>Both Mandy Lin and Lily Zhu express concerns about safety and the impact of anti-Asian violence on their daily lives.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
