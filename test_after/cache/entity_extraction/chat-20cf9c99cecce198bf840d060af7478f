Carrying\nour leftovers, we went our separate ways. As I waited below ground for the next L train, a Latina woman came\nup to me in the otherwise empty corridor and gave me a hard shove. I could see her breath fume out of her\nnostrils as I stumbled backward. She yelled a racial slur at me and walked out of the station. It was March 2020,\njust as COVID-19 was gripping the nation. At the time, the Asian reaction was mostly to tiptoe around the news\nthat came out of Wuhan. But people weren't tiptoeing around us.\nHate crimes as a whole declined last year, but they went up against Asian Americans by almost 150 percent in\n16 large US cities — 133 percent in Boston — according to the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino. The center attributed the steep rise to “negative stereotyping of\nAsians relating to the pandemic” in tandem with the rise in COVID-19 cases last March. By the time I was\ngetting forcefully pushed, the spike in anti-Asian assaults had already galvanized several advocacy groups to\nform a nonprofit, Stop AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) Hate, to track hate incidents and crimes; it has\nrecorded nearly 3,800 so far. I thought we'd be past this by now.\nBut we are not. Yesterday, eight people were killed, many of them women of Asian descent, in a series of\napparently connected shootings at three spas and massage parlors in the Atlanta area. “The reported shootings\nof Asian American women on Tuesday in Atlanta is an unspeakable tragedy — for the families of the victims first\nand foremost, but also for the AAPI community — which has been reeling from high levels of racial\ndiscrimination,” Stop AAPI Hate wrote on Twitter.\nDespite the steady vaccine rollout and the decrease of COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations, anti-Asian\nviolence continues to rise. Social media is full of symbolic and physical threats. Racist incidents are surging so\nmuch that the White House, informed by Stop AAPI Hate data and other advocacy groups, held a listening\nsession on March 4 with AAPI leaders. In a speech March 11, President Biden urged the nation to put an end to\nthis division, saying that Asian Americans are being “attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated,” adding,\n“It's wrong, it's un-American and it must stop.” Why is this still happening?\nIncited by a dangerous mixture of paranoia and ignorance, and further fueled by the Capitol storming of January\n6 by Trump supporters, some Americans are targeting their AAPI neighbors. In late February, at the\nConservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, the former president once again talked about the “China\nvirus” and was cheered by the audience. He weaponized COVID-19 initially by calling it the “Wuhan virus” and\n“kung flu” during his presidency; after he contracted COVID in October, anti-Asian rhetoric and conspiracy\ntheories on Twitter went up 85 percent, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\nFrom the beginning of the Gold Rush to the hysterics of “yellow peril,” Asian Americans have long been used as\nvessels of blame and anxiety. This happened during World War II when more than 120,000 Japanese Americans\nwere ordered into internment camps, and after 9/11 when South Asians were victims of xenophobia and\nIslamophobia.\nWe're invalidated as people of color and ignored as equal citizens. In a recent New York Times article, actor\nSteven Yeun wondered aloud “if the Asian-American experience is what it's like when you're thinking about\neveryone else, but nobody else is thinking about you.” Noel Quintana, a 61-year-old Filipino American whose\nface was slashed with a box cutter in February, remembers the invisibility he suffered in the New York City\nsubway: “Nobody came. Nobody helped. Nobody made a video,” he told the Washington Post. After generations\nof assimilation and sacrifice, why is the silence surrounding Asian Americans still louder than the Asian voice?\nI stopped wearing a mask in public after the incident last March, fearing I'd be accused of having the virus.\nMeanwhile, my Chinese friend in Queens was attacked and spit on for not wearing one, singled out as diseased\ndespite being in a train with other mask-less commuters. My best friend was called racial slurs as she commuted\nto class at Boston University. My mother, wearing her N95 mask while grocery shopping in Braintree, received\ncautious, disdainful glances from white mothers. My grandmother felt the same alienating tensions when she\nvisited her senior center in Quincy, feeling invisible from white visitors who avoided sitting next to her. From\ngrandmother, to mother, to daughter, our proximity to this violence and constant threat of bias alters how we go\nabout our daily lives and isolates the Asian in our Asian-American identity.\nI first came to this realization in high school when my friend's mom pointed out what she perceived as the\ndifference between me and my other Asian friend: I was “the one that's super Americanized.” After years of\ntransforming myself into an all-American girl, I was so close to winning the game. But despite all the Americanculture I had absorbed (and Asian culture I had lost), still, I am disqualified. Not truly American, only American-\nized. I'm now 21 and have been living in New York City for the past three years, but I'm hesitant to call it home.How has the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
