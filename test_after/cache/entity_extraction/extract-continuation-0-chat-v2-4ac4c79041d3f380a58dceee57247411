Clients can always work with someone of Asian descent or a refugee, but Wadsworth said interpreters serve to provide potential clients with \"an unspoken 'OK, you can trust her.' \"\nWadsworth said it's harder for members of the community to open up about their grief and trauma if they have to first explain the history of genocide in their country.\n\"It's really important to be humble and acknowledge there may be things I don't understand because I'm white,\" Wadsworth said. \"Your job is not to teach me, but I'm here to learn about you and what works for you and your culture ... it's true cultural humility.\"\nKao Saechao, specialty mental health division director for Asian Health Services in Oakland, said the community health center offers mental health services through more than 30 mental health workers and in 14 Asian languages.\nPatients coming in are often dealing with trauma, depression and anxiety. The center, which offers medical, mental health and dental care, serves about 50,000 people from low-income communities each year.\nSince the Atlanta shooting, the center has seen an uptick in requests for mental health services.\n\"The stigma is still very present in our community. I think there's still a lot of work that could be done to improve that,\" Saechao said. \"And also, somehow just normalizing mental health services and actually educating people on what that means and the benefits of mental health care.\"\nYoon's practice will soon have 12 therapists on staff and currently offers therapy services in Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, Spanish and Vietnamese.\nBut Yoon often thinks about the people they've had to turn away. While the practice tries to make referrals to therapists living closer to people making out-of-state inquiries, Yoon says they often have full client lists too.\nRecently Yoon and her business partner went to Big Bear with their families to decompress and enjoy the snow. But they still found themselves responding to emails and tinkering with how they'll run the upcoming support groups.\n\"We just can't take time off right now,\" Yoon said. \"I feel like we need to be there.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR EMPOWERING REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants in Oakland provides support and therapy for refugees and immigrants, focusing on mental health and coping with trauma and grief.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATE WADSWORTH<|>PERSON<|>Kate Wadsworth is the clinical director at the Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants, working with interpreters and clients to address mental health issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asian Health Services is a community health center in Oakland that offers mental health services in multiple Asian languages and serves low-income communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAO SAECHAO<|>PERSON<|>Kao Saechao is the specialty mental health division director at Asian Health Services, overseeing mental health services for the community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Yoon<|>PERSON<|>Yoon is a therapist who runs a practice offering therapy services in various languages and is focused on addressing mental health needs in the community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIG BEAR<|>GEO<|>Big Bear is a location where Yoon and her business partner went to decompress and enjoy the snow.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA AREA<|>GEO<|>The Atlanta area is referenced in relation to shootings that have impacted the mental health of the Southeast Asian community.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATE WADSWORTH<|>CENTER FOR EMPOWERING REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS<|>Kate Wadsworth is the clinical director at the Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants, leading efforts to support refugees and immigrants<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAO SAECHAO<|>ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES<|>Kao Saechao is the specialty mental health division director at Asian Health Services, managing mental health services for the community<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Yoon<|>ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES<|>Yoon's practice offers therapy services that complement the mental health services provided by Asian Health Services<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATE WADSWORTH<|>ATLANTA AREA<|>Kate Wadsworth expressed concern about the impact of the Atlanta-area shootings on her clients' mental health<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAO SAECHAO<|>ATLANTA AREA<|>Kao Saechao noted an increase in requests for mental health services following the Atlanta-area shootings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Yoon<|>BIG BEAR<|>Yoon visited Big Bear with her family to decompress, indicating a need for self-care amidst her work<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
