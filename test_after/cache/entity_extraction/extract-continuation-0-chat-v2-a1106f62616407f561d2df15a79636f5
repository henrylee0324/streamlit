We are the ones that nobody is afraid of. We are the ones that don't fight back. That's what I wish would change. People need to know that we will fight back and that we are a political force to be reckoned with.\" \nA paucity of established national political leaders have made Asian Americans an easy group to target, Penserga laments. He draws a comparison with Black people and figures like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson \"who organize, bring attention, apply pressure and get people to change\" when social issues affect their community. \n\"We don't have that,\" Penserga said. \nHate crimes against Asian Americans in major U.S. cities jumped by 150 percent in 2020, according to a study by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, which based its numbers on police department statistics. \nThat increase took place while overall hate crimes fell by 7 percent, according to the study. \nThe situation doesn't seem to have gotten any better in 2021 with a series of high-profile incidents including: \nThe shootings at three Altanta-based spas that left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent. Robert Aaron Long, 21, is facing eight first-degree murder counts but authorities have not filed hate crime charges against him. \nNew York City police arrested a man this week for brutally stomping on a 65-year-old Filipino woman in an assault widely viewed on social media. Brandon Elliott, on parole for killing his mother, allegedly told his victim \"you don't belong here\" during the attack. \nIn January, an 84-year-old native of Thailand going for a morning walk in his San Francisco neighborhood was pushed from behind by a man galloping at full speed and died from injuries sustained after he hit the pavement. A 19-year-old man has been charged in the case. \nFormer President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for inflammatory rhetoric around the COVID-19 epidemic that many, like Penserga, say has led to the burst in racist incidents. \nTrump regularly referred to the coronavirus as the \"kung flu\" or \"Chinese virus.\" \nPenserga, a chemistry teacher at Suncoast High School, said that he was recently asked by one of his students why it was wrong to refer to the \"China virus.\" \n\"What Trump has done is give permission to people to lash out, to make snide comments, to blame Asian Americans for all these problems, and it has only exacerbated the situation,\" said Penserga, who emigrated to the U.S. with his mother when he was 6. \"But it was there long before this.\" \nAnti-Aslan bigotry spurred Penserga \nto get into politics \nDespite his own early experience with anti-Asian bigotry, Penserga said he didn't realize the depth of the problem until he was a student at Temple University in Philadelphia. \nThe siblings of his Asian friends reported repeated incidents of harassment and physical violence and Penserga was gripped by \"how helpless they felt.\" \nThat left him with the realization that \"no one was coming to help us, but ourselves,\" moving him to get into politics. \nPenserga said his speech at Saturday's vigil will include the \"complicated fact\" that several of the recent incidents in which Asian Americans were victimized were allegedly perpetrated by Black men. \nComparisons between Blacks and Asian Americans, who are perceived to be succeeding in America despite their minority status, have long existed in order to divide the races, Penserga said. \nBlacks are told, \"Hey, look at those Asians. They're doing well. Why can't you?\" Penserga said. That breeds resentment and distrust. \n\"I don't have the answer to solving racism, but more racism is not the solution,\" Penserga said. \nSaturday's vigil is being sponsored by the Bangladeshi-American Democratic Club and will take place from noon to 3 p.m. at Bryant Park, located at 100 Golfview Road. \n\"We need to get back to the soul of this country which is, united we stand,\" said Junaid Akther, the club's president. \"That's the way we should live.\" \nPenserga, who was raised in Boynton Beach, said he hasn't been singled out for physical violence since middle school, but has been subjected to more subtle racism, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak. \nAt the beginning of the pandemic, Penserga said people \"would just move out of my way\" when he went grocery shopping. He still \"gets looks\" and hears muffled comments from other customers when he enters restaurants. \n\"They're uncomfortable that\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TY PENSERGA<|>PERSON<|>Ty Penserga is the Vice Mayor of Boynton Beach and an advocate against racism, particularly against Asian Americans, sharing his personal experiences with discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOYNTON BEACH<|>GEO<|>Boynton Beach is a city in Palm Beach County, Florida, where Ty Penserga serves as Vice Mayor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAKE WORTH BEACH<|>GEO<|>Lake Worth Beach is a city in Florida where a vigil is being held to remember victims of violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRYANT PARK<|>GEO<|>Bryant Park is a location in Lake Worth Beach where the vigil for victims of violence against Asian Americans is scheduled to take place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city where a shooting rampage occurred, resulting in the deaths of eight people, including six Asian American women.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States whose rhetoric during the COVID-19 pandemic has been criticized for inciting racism against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University conducts research on hate crimes, including those against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNCOAST HIGH SCHOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Suncoast High School is where Ty Penserga works as a chemistry teacher.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANGALDESHI-AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC CLUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bangladeshi-American Democratic Club is sponsoring the vigil for victims of violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCH 16<|>EVENT<|>March 16 is the date of the shooting rampage in Atlanta that resulted in the deaths of eight people, including six Asian American women.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TY PENSERGA<|>BOYNTON BEACH<|>Ty Penserga is the Vice Mayor of Boynton Beach, representing the city in political matters<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TY PENSERGA<|>LAKE WORTH BEACH<|>Ty Penserga is a speaker at the vigil being held in Lake Worth Beach<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAKE WORTH BEACH<|>BRYANT PARK<|>The vigil for victims of violence against Asian Americans is taking place at Bryant Park in Lake Worth Beach<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>MARCH 16<|>The shooting rampage in Atlanta occurred on March 16, resulting in multiple fatalities<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>TY PENSERGA<|>Ty Penserga criticizes Donald Trump's rhetoric for contributing to racism against Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM<|>TY PENSERGA<|>Ty Penserga references the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism's study on hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TY PENSERGA<|>SUNCOAST HIGH SCHOOL<|>Ty Penserga works as a chemistry teacher at Suncoast High School<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANGALDESHI-AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC CLUB<|>LAKE WORTH BEACH<|>The Bangladeshi-American Democratic Club is sponsoring the vigil in Lake Worth Beach<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
