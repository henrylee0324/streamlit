After the incident, Troy Sprague, 47, was arrested on charges of criminal mischief and interfering with constitutional and civil rights.\nHe has been released on bail. The attorney general's complaint seeks a protection order for Chhay and her family that prohibits Sprague from having any contact with them or violating the Maine Civil Rights Act. According to Attorney General Aaron Frey, Sprague kicked a side mirror off Chhay's car, and a piece of debris struck Chhay's daughter.\n\"We are bearing witness to an unconscionable increase in hate crimes being perpetrated against individuals of Asian descent in our nation,\" Frey said in a statement. \"We will not tolerate such attacks in Maine and we will act swiftly to address allegations like those received last week in Portland.\"\nNationally, hate crimes against Asian-Americans have have been on the rise.\nAn Asian American woman was attacked in New York City on Monday by a man who repeatedly kicked her. Two people nearby, who appeared to be security guards, did not intervene, according to surveillance footage released by police. The 65-year-old woman was walking a few blocks from Times Square when the man approached and kicked her in the stomach, knocking her to the ground, police said. The man then stomped on the woman's face several times while shouting anti-Asian insults, police said. He then casually walked away, the footage shows.\nRobert Aaron Long, 21, is accused of killing eight people, six of them Asian, at three Atlanta-area massage parlors in an attack that sent terror through the Asian-American community, which has increasingly been targeted during the coronavirus pandemic. It was the worst mass killing in the U.S. in almost two years.\nThe Atlanta-area killings horrified Asian-Americans, and was part of a growing number of assaults coinciding with the spread of COVID-19 across the United States. The virus was first identified in China, and former President Donald Trump and others have used racially charged terms to describe it.\nChhay, who was introduced as a business owner and photographer, was only able to read part of her statement to the vigil crowd before she was overcome with emotion. Her daughter finished reading her mother's statement.\n\"I thought Portland was a tucked away safe zone to live,\" Chhay wrote, adding that she was aware of attacks on other Asian-Americans across the country. \"I never dreamed this could happen to me. I was attacked for no other reason than my Asian heritage.\n\"We have been victims for far too long and I refuse to be a victim,\" Chhay said. \"There is strength in numbers and we need to let the world know that we are not going to take this anymore.\"\n\"We are heartbroken,\" said another vigil speaker, Chan Himm, referring to the spate of anti-Asian hate incidents. Himm is the former president and chief executive officer of Unified Asian Communities. \"In Maine we are also dealing with anti-Asian hate. It (the attack on Chhay) is a stark reminder that we are not immune to hate.\"\nSeveral Portland Public School students held signs showing photographs of the Asian-Americans who have been killed or attacked in recent weeks. Each student read a brief profile of the victim and what happened to them.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PORTLAND<|>GEO<|>Portland is a city in Maine where a vigil against anti-Asian violence was held.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAYSON PARK<|>GEO<|>Payson Park is the location in Portland where hundreds gathered to support the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED ASIAN COMMUNITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>United Asian Communities is an organization represented by Thomas Ling, advocating for the Asian community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOMAS LING<|>PERSON<|>Thomas Ling is the vice president of United Asian Communities and spoke at the vigil.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAVII CHHAY<|>PERSON<|>Navii Chhay is a business owner and photographer of Asian descent who was attacked along with her daughter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TROY SPRAGUE<|>PERSON<|>Troy Sprague is the man accused of attacking Navii Chhay and her daughter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AARON FREY<|>PERSON<|>Aaron Frey is the Maine Attorney General who commented on the rise of hate crimes against Asian-Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>PERSON<|>Robert Aaron Long is accused of killing eight people, six of them Asian, in Atlanta-area massage parlors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is the city where the mass killing of eight people, including six Asian individuals, occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is the pandemic that has coincided with a rise in anti-Asian violence and hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOMAS LING<|>UNITED ASIAN COMMUNITIES<|>Thomas Ling is the vice president of United Asian Communities, which organized the vigil<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAVII CHHAY<|>TROY SPRAGUE<|>Navii Chhay was attacked by Troy Sprague, leading to a civil rights complaint<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AARON FREY<|>NAVII CHHAY<|>Aaron Frey, as Attorney General, is involved in the legal actions concerning the attack on Navii Chhay<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>ATLANTA<|>Robert Aaron Long is associated with the mass killing that occurred in Atlanta<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>NAVII CHHAY<|>The rise in anti-Asian violence, including the attack on Navii Chhay, has been linked to the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PORTLAND<|>PAYSON PARK<|>Payson Park is a location in Portland where the vigil took place<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOMAS LING<|>PORTLAND<|>Thomas Ling spoke at the vigil held in Portland<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAVII CHHAY<|>THOMAS LING<|>Navii Chhay's experience was shared at the vigil where Thomas Ling spoke<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AARON FREY<|>TROY SPRAGUE<|>Aaron Frey is involved in the legal case against Troy Sprague for the attack on Chhay<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOMAS LING<|>NAVII CHHAY<|>Thomas Ling's speech at the vigil addressed the issues faced by individuals like Navii Chhay<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
