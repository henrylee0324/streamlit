The man\nallegedly would go on to kill 8 and wound dozens in what has been described by many as a domestic terrorist\nattack and hate crime. Long, according to Sheriffs, told authorities that a ‘sex addiction’ was the reason for his\nattack.\nLong, who was apprehended in South Georgia, is believed by law enforcement to be responsible for all three spa\nshootings that took place in the state. Authorities quickly announced that there was no immediate motive and\nurged the public not to jump to immediate conclusions, however, various facts began to slowly trickle out\nleading activists and many concerned citizens alike to declare the shooting a hate crime.\nOne user on Twitter wrote of Long “He was taken into custody alive. Because he’s White. Remember that. He\ndidn’t get shot, he didn’t get beaten. He got taken into custody alive. Because he’s White.” The author brought\nup the concept of White privilege in police interactions, citing conversations surrounding mass shooters Dylann\nRoof and Nikolas Cruz.\nUsers also pointed to former president Donald Trump’s referral to the COVID-19 pandemic as possible inspiration\nfor the shooting. The then-president used the term “China Virus” over 20 times publicly in just 14 days and\ncontinues to double-down on the statement, having again uttered the term at CPAC 2021.\nLong is the son of a Baptist preacher. The bio of an Instagram page believed to belong to him reads “Pizza,\nguns, drums, music, family, and God. This pretty much sums up my life. It’s a pretty good life.” The Woodstock\nnative graduated from Sequoyah High School, a public school in Hickory Flat, in 2017. The man has been\ndescribed as quiet, religious, and ‘innocent seeming.’ Long has also been described as an avid hunter.\nA Facebook account with Long’s name and photo has also engaged in Anti-Chinese rants on Facebook, writing\n“China is engaged in a COVID coverup. They blocked our investigators from going to their lab in Wuhan and\nfinding out the truth about the experiments they were conducting there.” The authenticity of the account has not\nbeen verified.\nWhile it’s currently unclear if the targeted businesses had connections to sex trafficking, Atlanta mayor Keisha\nLance Bottoms has characterized the establishments as “legally operating businesses that have not been on our\nradar,” and went on to condemn “victim blaming.”\nA spokesperson for the Cherokee County Sheriff, Jay Baker, has said Long most likely acted alone in a plight to\neliminate possible temptations for sex addiction.\n“These locations, he sees them as an outlet for him, something he shouldn’t be doing,” he said, adding that\nLong told authorities he had an “issue with porn” and was “attempting to take out that temptation.”\nCherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds added that Long possibly frequented the establishments in the past and\n“might have been lashing out.”\nOfficials say Long told investigators he was on his way to Florida, possibly plotting to target more spa\nbusinesses.\nThe killings, which come in the midst of an apparent rise in hate crimes against Asian citizens in places such as\nNew York and San Francisco, have exacerbated race relations worldwide as well as in the Asian-American\ncommunity, with many citizens feeling persecuted and in fear of their lives.\nLong is currently in custody at the Crisp County Sheriff’s Jail.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT AARON LONG<|>PERSON<|>Robert Aaron Long is a 21-year-old man accused of carrying out a mass shooting at three Asian massage parlors in Georgia, resulting in 8 deaths and numerous injuries.
