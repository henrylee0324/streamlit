According to a report issued by the Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate, a coalition of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups, Asian Americans in the US have reported nearly 3,800 hate-related incidents in less than a year.\nThe report shows the types of discrimination range from verbal harassment and physical assaults, to online harassment and civil rights violations.\nWhile the death of African American George Floyd last year and the subsequent mass protests exposed the US' protracted, systematic and serious racial discrimination, the rising number of attacks on Asian Americans should draw equal attention and serious soul-searching in US society.\nAdmittedly, racial inequality has long plagued the US and tarnished its reputation as a \"melting pot\" of different immigrant groups. But, the rise of white supremacist ideologies in recent years and irresponsible US politicians who have used the pandemic to spread biased sentiments have fanned the flames of racial discrimination in the US.\nFormer US president Donald Trump and members of his administration repeatedly referred to the novel coronavirus as the \"China virus\" and \"Wuhan virus\" in a bid to deflect public criticism over their woeful handling of the pandemic, and this fueled hatred against Asian Americans.\nWith its own house in a mess, the US out of arrogance and hypocrisy, has continued to apply a double standard in the world pointing an accusing finger at other countries' human rights and democracy.\nBefore accusing others of abusing human rights, it should get its own house in order.\nHence, the onus is on the current US administration to cultivate a harmonious social atmosphere in the US where the rights of people from different backgrounds are equally protected.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city in the United States where multiple shootings occurred, leading to public outcry against violence towards Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is a state in the United States where the shooter involved in the Atlanta shootings is from.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in the United States where an elderly Chinese woman was attacked, highlighting issues of violence against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate is a coalition that reports on hate-related incidents against Asian Americans in the US.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>PERSON<|>George Floyd was an African American whose death sparked mass protests against racial discrimination in the US.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former US president whose administration's rhetoric contributed to rising anti-Asian sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans in the US.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Asian Americans are individuals of Asian descent living in the US who have faced increased violence and discrimination during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEORGIA<|>The shootings in Atlanta involved a suspect from Georgia, linking the city to the state<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The attack on the elderly Chinese woman in San Francisco is an example of violence against Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STOP ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER HATE<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The organization reports on hate-related incidents affecting Asian Americans<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGE FLOYD<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The protests following George Floyd's death also highlighted the discrimination faced by Asian Americans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Donald Trump's rhetoric during the pandemic contributed to increased discrimination against Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
