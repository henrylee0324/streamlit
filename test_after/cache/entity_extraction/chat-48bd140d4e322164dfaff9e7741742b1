Kim, a Brighton defense attorney who emigrated from Korea with his family when he was 5 years old, said passing drivers routinely shout racial epithets at him, and\nclients have rejected him because of his heritage.\n“It's a terrible scourge that has always been there,'' said Kim, who was deployed to Afghanistan in 2011 as a member of the Massachusetts National Guard. “The undercurrent and\nthe underbelly of this country has always had that.”\nHe added: “There is this very tiring trope that Asian Americans have lived with for our entire existence here, whether you are first generation, second generation, third or forth.\nAnd that's the consistent perception amongst the rest of the American population that we are foreigners. That we don't belong.”\nBoston City Councilor Michelle Wu issued a statement decrying the shootings. Eight people in total were killed at three spas during the rampage, according to investigators. Seven\nof the victims were women.\n“I join our Asian American community in mourning, and solidarity, following the senseless shootings in the Atlanta area last night,” she wrote on her Twitter account Wednesday.\n“It's heartbreaking & appalling to see the anti-Asian harassment, violence, and now mass murder that has accelerated over the past year.”\nIn her statement, Wu, an at-large city councilor who is a candidate to succeed Mayor Martin J. Walsh, said the incident was “part of a long history of racism in American that we\nmust all fight to end.”\n“All too often, the most silenced members of our community — Asian American elders and women working in invisible industries — have borne the brunt of these attacks,” she\nwrote.\nPolice said they arrested Robert Aaron Long, 21, after a brief manhunt following Tuesday's shootings. He confessed to the shootings during an interview with authorities and said\nhis actions were not racially motivated, police said.\nLong was charged Wednesday with four counts of murder and one count of assault, officials said.\nAtlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said it was still early in the investigation and a determination had not yet been made whether it was a hate crime.\nThe killings come as crimes against Asian Americans have spiked across the United States. Since the start of the pandemic, Asian Americans reported nearly 3,800 hate-related\nincidents in all 50 states, according to a report released Tuesday by Stop AAPI Hate, an organization that advocates for Asian and Pacific Islander Americans.\n“The unconscionable blaming of Asian American communities for the devastation of this pandemic has reinforced the sense of invisibility and perpetual foreigner status that so\nmany of us have known our entire lives‚” Wu wrote.\nThe daughter of immigrants from Taiwan, Wu wrote about her own personal experiences, saying that “some of my most vivid childhood memories involve racist encounters with\nstrangers. People who knew nothing about me except for my appearance feeling empowered to pull eyes into slits, or to chant ching chong sounds.”\nShe said she knew “that constant feeling of needing to be aware, ready, on guard whenever out in public,” she said.\nShe added that ”since before COVID-19 was spreading in United States, Asian American communities have been on edge. Boston has not been immune these incidents.”\nVinh Bui, 36, of Dorchester, said he felt angry when he learned about what happened in Atlanta.\nBui was born in refugee camp and came to the United States when he was two months old. He grew up in Fields Corner and said throughout his childhood he experienced\ndiscrimination firsthand for being part of what he called “the invisible minority.”\n“I was bullied my entire childhood,” Bui said. “I was assaulted by older kids, and sometimes verbally assaulted by adults...As a kid I was spat on. I had black eyes and busted lips\ngrowing up. I didn't know what a 'gook' was until they started calling me that.”\nAnd then he started fighting back.\n“We escaped war to enter another war,” he said.\nThe Asian and Pacific Islanders Civic Action Network said in a statement that the organization was “enraged and devastated” by the murders.\n“Increased and unchecked anti-Asian rhetoric during the COVID-19 pandemic has fueled xenophobia and anti-Asian racism,” the statement said. “We have seen a rise in attacks on\nAsian Americans, particularly elderly people, across the country, and a lack of safety in all aspects of our community members' lives.”\nWomen experience the brunt of this racism, according to the statement.\n“Asian American women are on the frontlines of our economic sectors, including as domestic workers and nail salon workers,” the statement said. “Asian American women are also\nthe center of our family lives as homemakers and caretakers. Asian American women live simultaneously at the margins of society and at the intersection of immigration, gender,\nrace, and class.”\nThe Lowell Police Department issued a statement denouncing “the recent incidents of violence against members of the Asian community in other areas of the country” and said\nthat there would be an “increased police presence at locations and areas that could potentially be targeted.”\n“Violence against individuals because of their race or background can never be tolerated,” Lowell Police Superintendent Raymond Kelly Richardson said in the statement. “Members\nof the Asian Community in Lowell can rest assured that the Lowell Police Department stands with them and is taking proactive measures to deter such incidents in Lowell.”\nThe Massachusetts House of Representatives' Asian caucus members -- Donald Wong, Tackey Chan, Paul Schmid, Rady Mom, Maria Robinson, Tram Nguyen, Vanna Howard, and\nErika Uyterhoeven -- put\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
