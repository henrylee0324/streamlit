particularly among older Asian American women - following the March 29 assault of Vilma Kari, the 65-year-old Filipino American woman who was beaten on her way to church in Manhattan. \nPresiding Officer Richard Nicolello (R-New Hyde Park) said merely because there have been no reported hate crimes against Asian Americans in Nassau, \"that doesn't mean they aren't occurring.\" \nNicolello said, \"Asians are feeling the effects of these hate crimes and it's important that we are proactive with these issues.\" \nNassau County Executive Laura Curran said, \"although there have been no reported hate crimes targeting Asians in Nassau, we must remain vigilant in the face of a horrifying rise of Anti-Asian attacks in our state and country.\" \n\"I commend the Legislature for treating this matter with the urgency it deserves,\" Curran, a Democrat, said in a statement. \nSeveral residents testified that as more businesses open up and people begin to emerge from pandemic lockdowns, incidents of anti-Asian rhetoric have become a major problem in Nassau County, though many have gone unreported. \n\"I'm born and raised in New York City. I'm a die-hard Yankee fan, but there isn't a day that goes by that I'm not reminded I'm Chinese,\" said Derek Chan of Roslyn. \nOther speakers called on the police department to assign a dedicated investigator to Asian American hate crimes. \nSome also said the state's new discovery law, enacted in 2019, allowing for victim information to be shared with defense counsel leads to underreporting of hate crimes. \n\"We need to have someone in the police department who understands the culture\" of Asian American communities, said David Chan of Manhasset. \nRyder said the department is working with the Office of Asian American Affairs on an outreach program to make sure community members are aware of their rights and the services the county and the police department provide. \n\"It's not just a concern for the Asian American community. But it's all communities in Nassau County,\" Ryder said. \"We have a zero tolerance for hate and we have zero tolerance for bias... \n11 \nRyder referred to a 400-page police reform plan the county submitted to the state on April 1, saying the proposal makes building trust in various communities a priority, so residents know \"they can come to us to report these crimes.\" \n\"We cannot do it alone,\" Ryder said, \"We need to have families involved to move away from the Archie Bunker mentality.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nassau County is a local government entity focused on addressing hate crimes and cultural needs in vulnerable communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATRICK RYDER<|>PERSON<|>Patrick Ryder is the police commissioner of Nassau County, involved in creating plans to prevent hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINEOLA<|>GEO<|>Mineola is a location in Nassau County where a Public Safety Committee hearing took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FARAH MOZAWALLA<|>PERSON<|>Farah Mozawalla is the executive director of the Office of Asian American Affairs in Nassau County.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VILMA KARI<|>PERSON<|>Vilma Kari is a 65-year-old Filipino American woman who was assaulted in Manhattan, highlighting the issue of anti-Asian hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURA CURRAN<|>PERSON<|>Laura Curran is the Nassau County Executive who emphasizes the importance of addressing hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEREK CHAN<|>PERSON<|>Derek Chan is a resident of Roslyn who spoke about his experiences as a Chinese American in Nassau County.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVID CHAN<|>PERSON<|>David Chan is a resident of Manhasset who called for a dedicated investigator for Asian American hate crimes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATRICK RYDER<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>Patrick Ryder, as police commissioner, is responsible for implementing plans within Nassau County to prevent hate crimes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAH MOZAWALLA<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>Farah Mozawalla works within Nassau County's Office of Asian American Affairs, focusing on the needs of Asian American communities.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAURA CURRAN<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>Laura Curran, as the county executive, oversees the initiatives and policies of Nassau County regarding hate crimes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VILMA KARI<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>Vilma Kari's assault is an example of the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEREK CHAN<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>Derek Chan is a resident of Nassau County who expressed concerns about anti-Asian sentiment in the community.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVID CHAN<|>NASSAU COUNTY<|>David Chan is a resident of Nassau County advocating for better policing of hate crimes against Asian Americans.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
