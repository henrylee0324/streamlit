This has contributed to a climate of growing fear in an atmosphere already made volatile by COVID-19,\" she said. \n\"Hatred has no place in any society that wishes to heal,\" Robredo added. \nThe lady official said she was hopeful that the Biden administration \"will ensure the safety of all Asians and minority groups, even as it works to address the deeper issues of racism and racial violence.\" \n\"Towards this common goal, we stand as allies of the American people, behind a long history of friendship and a shared commitment to upholding democratic values and the dignity of every human being,\" Robredo said. \nForeign media called the recent attacks on Asian-Americans \"COVID hate crimes\" as the spate of killings and attacks happen as some sectors of the American public blamed Asians for the spread of the coronavirus and their eventual loss of jobs, income, and lives. \nJust recently, an elderly Filipino-American woman was attacked in New York City by a man whose mother was believed to have died from COVID-19. The elderly woman was walking down the street when the man suddenly kicked her in the stomach and continued to do so even as she fell on the ground. \nAnother elderly Filipino-American who was in a New York City subway was slashed in the face with a box cutter. This is not only happening in New York. Asian hate crimes are happening all over the US as California sets up additional patrols in Chinatown because of the growing assaults on Asians there. \nIn March, Biden urged the USCongress to pass the hate crime legislation. He also established a COVID-19 Equity Task Force committee to address and end xenophobia against Asian Americans.During his first week in office, Biden also signed an executive action that banned the use of anti-China rhetoric in the federal government that was prevalent during the time of former President Donald Trump.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOSEPH BIDEN JR.<|>PERSON<|>Joseph Biden Jr. is the President of the United States, advocating for the safety of Asians and minority groups in response to increasing hate crimes against them.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LENI ROBREDO<|>PERSON<|>Leni Robredo is the Vice President of the Philippines, expressing concern over the hate crimes against Asians in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILIPINOS<|>PERSON<|>Filipinos are individuals from the Philippines, who are among the minority groups targeted in recent hate crimes in the US.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has contributed to a climate of fear and racial hatred against Asians in the US.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is a location where several hate crimes against Asian-Americans have occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a state in the US that has set up additional patrols in Chinatown due to growing assaults on Asians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US CONGRESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The US Congress is the legislative body that Biden urged to pass hate crime legislation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 EQUITY TASK FORCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The COVID-19 Equity Task Force is a committee established by Biden to address and end xenophobia against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is the former President of the United States, whose administration was associated with anti-China rhetoric.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LENI ROBREDO<|>JOSEPH BIDEN JR.<|>Leni Robredo expressed hope that the Biden administration will ensure the safety of Asians and minority groups<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOSEPH BIDEN JR.<|>US CONGRESS<|>Joseph Biden Jr. urged the US Congress to pass hate crime legislation to protect minority groups<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOSEPH BIDEN JR.<|>COVID-19 EQUITY TASK FORCE<|>Joseph Biden Jr. established the COVID-19 Equity Task Force to address xenophobia against Asian Americans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LENI ROBREDO<|>FILIPINOS<|>Leni Robredo highlighted the plight of Filipinos among the targeted groups in hate crimes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>LENI ROBREDO<|>Leni Robredo mentioned that the pandemic has contributed to a climate of fear and racial hatred<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>FILIPINOS<|>Several hate crimes against Filipinos have occurred in New York City<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>California and New York City are both locations where hate crimes against Asians have been reported<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>JOSEPH BIDEN JR.<|>Joseph Biden Jr. signed an executive action to ban anti-China rhetoric that was prevalent during Donald Trump's presidency<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
