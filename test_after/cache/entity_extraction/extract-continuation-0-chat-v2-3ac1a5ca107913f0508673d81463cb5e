Newly spurred to action to combat bias, Asian American artists generate subway posters leverage social media and stage Zoom webinars. (Jingyu Lin/The New York Times)Early in the pandemic, word started to travel among Asian American artists: Racist attacks were on the rise. Jamie Chan told a fellow artist Kenneth Tam about getting kicked out of an Uber pool ride by the driver who noticed her sniffling. Anicka Yi, an artist based in New York, called Christine Y. Kim, a curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, to talk about being spit at on a Manhattan street; Kim in turn recounted being accosted in a Whole Foods parking lot.Tam decided to start recording these incidents in a Google spreadsheet he named \"We Are Not COVID.\" It circulated on social media first among arts communities then to wider audiences. Over the past several months the document has filled up with reports ranging from microaggressions to outright violence.\"I had assumed that things like this were going to start happening but not so quickly and not to people I knew\" Tam said in a phone interview. \"It made me realize that I needed to educate myself and perhaps other people about it.\"The rise of racist attacks, some of them horrifyingly lethal, has galvanized Asian American artists around the country. They are leveraging social media to raise awareness, gathering to protest despite the pandemic precautions, making new work and — perhaps above all — finding new grounds for solidarity with one another and with other affected communities to figure out how to respond to the current climate.Recent anti-Asian sentiment may have been stoked by former President Donald Trump's xenophobic response to COVID-19, which he repeatedly called \"the Chinese virus.\" But it existed long before him, since the arrival of Chinese workers in the 19th century and stubbornly persists even after his departure from office.The effects of this rhetoric have laid bare the vulnerabilities of a group that comprises 5% of the U.S. population and is breathtakingly diverse in its makeup marked by extreme disparities in income, language and culture.The murders in Atlanta, in which a young white man killed workers and others in Asian-owned massage businesses, highlighted additional complexities of gender and race: Of the eight victims, six were Asian American women, mostly of Korean descent.An exhibition titled \"Godzilla vs. the Art World: 1990-2001\" that was scheduled to open in May at the Museum of Chinese in America and a forthcoming anthology edited by curator Howie Chen about the group Godzilla, a loose affiliation of artists and curators are timely reminders that activism is not new for Asian American art workers.They have been organizing for years to increase representation, improve their visibility and forge alliances with other groups.Godzilla was founded in 1990 in New York City by Ken Chu, Bing Lee, Margo Machida and others. The group tackled problems associated with being Asian American in an art world that tended to see race only in terms of Black and white. In the wake of the 1991 Whitney Biennial it wrote to the museum's director to object to the near-absence of Asian American artists.The message had its intended effect: The 1993 biennial included work by several artists of Asian descent including Byron Kim. His \"Synecdoche\", a minimalist grid of painted panels each keyed to the precise skin tone of a friend, a neighbor or stranger, functioned as an abstract group portrait of his multicultural world.A recent series of abstract works by Kim signals an important shift: It still focuses on skin but this time that skin is bruised. Done around the time of the 2016 presidential election, the pigment-dyed canvases are less a celebration of multiculturalism than a subtle commentary on the rise of xenophobic and racist politics in the United States.Likewise today's wave of activism seems less concerned about representation – inclusion of artists in exhibitions or hiring of more Asian American museum staff – than on larger issues like the surveillance of immigrant neighborhoods, income inequality and criminalization of sex work that put their communities at risk.This change in approach recently led 19 artists involved in Godzilla to withdraw from the exhibition planned by the Museum of Chinese in America in protest of what they called the museum's \"complicit support\" of the construction of a jail in Chinatown. (The museum received a $35 million concession from the city, part of a program to invest funds in neighborhoods affected by the construction of facilities in the aftermath of Rikers Island's closure.)\"The way to fight this kind of xenophobia and white supremacy is to organize and fight the root causes of structural racism and capitalism\" said artist Betty Yu, a founder of Chinatown Art Brigade (CAB).With co-founders Tomie Arai and ManSee Kong and a network of other artists and organizers, CAB has been working over the past five years to oppose the gentrification of New York's Chinatown neighborhood and the resulting mass displacement.The loss of affordable housing and the closing of garment factories employing thousands of new immigrants are not unconnected to the art world. More and more art galleries are moving into the area, driving up rents.That encroachment has driven other activist groups to focus on the art world as an epicenter for talking about anti-Asian hate. Stop DiscriminAsian (SDA), which came into being a year ago when Yi began to connect disparate Asian-centered groups and individuals working around the country, including Kim and Tam. As the group grew, the question of how to leverage their own positions in the art world became central.\"It was one of the compelling things that we thought that we as arts workers could contribute to just because of the fact that so many art spaces, at least in New York and LA and even the Bay Area, were physically adjacent to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN ART BRIGADE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinatown Art Brigade is an activist group in New York founded by Tomie Arai, Betty Yu, and ManSee Kong, focused on combating bias and advocating for the Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMIE ARAI<|>PERSON<|>Tomie Arai is a co-founder of the Chinatown Art Brigade, involved in activism against gentrification and anti-Asian hate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETTY YU<|>PERSON<|>Betty Yu is a co-founder of the Chinatown Art Brigade and an artist advocating for the Asian American community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANSEE KONG<|>PERSON<|>ManSee Kong is a co-founder of the Chinatown Art Brigade, working to oppose gentrification in New York's Chinatown.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMIE CHAN<|>PERSON<|>Jamie Chan is an Asian American artist who reported experiencing racial bias during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KENNETH TAM<|>PERSON<|>Kenneth Tam is an artist who documented incidents of racial bias in a Google spreadsheet named \"We Are Not COVID.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANICKA YI<|>PERSON<|>Anicka Yi is an artist based in New York who has spoken out about experiences of racism during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTINE Y.
