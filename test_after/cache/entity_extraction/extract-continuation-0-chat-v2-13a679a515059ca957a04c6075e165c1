Her family lived in Westchester County, New York, before moving to Cresskill, where she sometimes felt boxed in. \nChan and Hur both understand the Asian immigrant experience and that language and culture have been barriers to attaining visibility. \n\"We're taught to work hard, keep our heads down, don't make trouble. These are cultural foundations,\" Hur said. \"We wrestle with it. I know our whole community wrestles with it.\" \nSo Chan is working on helping others in the community speak out. \"There's so much hesitation due to cultural norms,\" she said. \nA goal of the movement is to unify Asian Americans throughout New Jersey and celebrate diversity within diversity. \n\"We are made up of different cultures and races from around the world,\" Chan said. \"That's what makes us stronger.\" \nChris Chung \nAs he was growing up in a Korean immigrant household in Tenafly, assimilation was difficult for Chris Chung. He arrived in the United States at the age of 11 in 1978 and was among the few immigrant children in his school. While other classmates' parents attended school events and cheered for their children, Chung's parents were busy working at the family business, a general merchandise store in Brooklyn, and later a wholesale fine jewelry business. \n\"I envied other children's parents attending events, from sporting events to school events,\" said Chung, 53. \"That always stuck with me.\" As a result, he always thought that when he grew up and had children, he would make sure he was part of their education. \n— \nAs an adult living in Palisades Park - and wanting his children to enjoy a life he did not have Chung, a real estate agent, decided to get involved in local politics. Initially he ran for school board and then a Borough Council seat before being elected mayor in a contentious race against incumbent James Rotundo in 2018. An online tirade by Rotundo's mother against the town's large Korean community went viral. \nLorraine Rotundo posted on Facebook shortly after her son learned that the Democratic primary race in June of 2018 was too close to call. \n\"Go to hell PALISADES PARK, let the GD KOREANS have this F'n town,\" she wrote. \"All of us AMERICANS are so done. I am going to suggest that only English be spoken in our Boro Hall at least while an AMERICAN is still the mayor.\" \nRotundo apologized for her post. More than 300 Korean Americans took to the streets to protest. \nNow in his third year as mayor, Chung reflects on his role as leader of a community that is almost 60% Asian. \n\"My whole purpose is to serve the community,\" Chung said. \"I'm not title-hungry.\" \nSince taking office, Chung has implemented changes such as hiring Korean-speaking staff to serve residents and translating the borough's website into Korean and Spanish.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TENAFLY<|>GEO<|>Tenafly is a town in New Jersey where Chan and her husband chose to raise their son and where Chris Chung grew up as a Korean immigrant.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is where Chan was born to Chinese immigrant parents who owned Chinese restaurants.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRESSKILL<|>GEO<|>Cresskill is a town in New Jersey where Chan's family lived before moving to Tenafly.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WESTCHESTER COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Westchester County is where Chan's family lived before moving to Cresskill.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRIS CHUNG<|>PERSON<|>Chris Chung is a real estate agent and the mayor of Palisades Park, who grew up in a Korean immigrant household.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAN<|>PERSON<|>Chan is a recovering lawyer and a stay-at-home mom who is working to help the Asian American community speak out.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMES ROTUNDO<|>PERSON<|>James Rotundo is the incumbent mayor who was defeated by Chris Chung in the 2018 election.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALISADES PARK<|>GEO<|>Palisades Park is a borough in New Jersey where Chris Chung serves as mayor and where a significant portion of the population is Asian.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOREAN COMMUNITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Korean community in Palisades Park is a significant demographic that Chris Chung represents as mayor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Asian Americans in New Jersey are a diverse group that Chan aims to unify and celebrate their diversity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOROUGH COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Borough Council is the local government body in Palisades Park where Chris Chung was elected after running for school board.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2018 ELECTION<|>EVENT<|>The 2018 election was a contentious race in which Chris Chung was elected mayor of Palisades Park against James Rotundo.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHAN<|>ASIAN AMERICANS<|>Chan is working to help unify Asian Americans in New Jersey and celebrate their diversity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRIS CHUNG<|>PALISADES PARK<|>Chris Chung serves as the mayor of Palisades Park, representing a community that is almost 60% Asian<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRIS CHUNG<|>BOROUGH COUNCIL<|>Chris Chung was elected to the Borough Council before becoming mayor<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRIS CHUNG<|>KOREAN COMMUNITY<|>Chris Chung represents the Korean community in Palisades Park as their mayor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMES ROTUNDO<|>CHRIS CHUNG<|>James Rotundo was the incumbent mayor defeated by Chris Chung in the 2018 election<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TENAFLY<|>CHRIS CHUNG<|>Chris Chung grew up in Tenafly, which influenced his perspective as a mayor<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>CHAN<|>Chan was born in New York City to Chinese immigrant parents<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRESSKILL<|>CHAN<|>Chan's family lived in Cresskill before moving to Tenafly<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WESTCHESTER COUNTY<|>CHAN<|>Chan's family lived in Westchester County before moving to Cresskill<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
