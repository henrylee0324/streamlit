During a storytelling workshop, she shared that story and began to chokeup.\n\"I literally was standing up there with my heart in my throat,\" Mahsaid. \"Being in front of people isn't new to me but being in front of people almost in tears about something so personal is new and it hitme. It was really hitting close tohome.\"\nThe issue of racism in North America was once again brought to the forefront following a mass shooting at an Atlanta spa on March 16 that left six Asian American womendead.\nThe Asian community isn't the only one being targeted byviolence. Recently, several Black and Muslim women have been attacked in Edmonton, with one of the first reported inDecember.\nIn an act of solidarity, antihate and anti-racism walks were held Saturday across communities including one in Edmonton, which went from Wong's Benevolent Association on 96 Street to ChurchillSquare. Hundreds marched holding signs saying 'Stop Hate', 'We All Deserve to be Safe'and 'Hate is a Virus.' Speakers shared stories about being harassed daily because of the colour of theirskin.\nMost people who attended wore masks and organizers reminded participants to maintain six feet of physical distance in order to follow public healthorders.\nMah said many incidents gounder-reported.\n\"There's mistrust of the authorities,\" Mahsaid. \"There's also this myth... of the modelminority. It's the stereotype that's used against Asians saying they're hard workers, put your head down and don't maketrouble. It sounds like a good stereotype but it'snot. It's used against Asian communities alot.\"\nSince the start of the pandemic, 1,150 cases of racist attacks were reported across Canada, according to a March 23 survey by the Chinese Canadian National Council TorontoChapter.\nWhile the majority of these cases took place in Ontario and British Columbia, 11 per cent of all reported incidents involved violence or unwanted physical contact, the surveysaid. About 10 per cent of cases involved someone being coughed at or spaton.\nMah said what needs to happen now is for political leaders to step up and take action.\n\"When you have past administrations at the highest level calling it 'Kung Flu'and being extremely racist that creates a hateful environment,\" shesaid. \"We need our leaders tolead. We need our leaders to speak up and we need our leaders to create an environment that is safe foreveryone.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SERENA MAH<|>PERSON<|>Serena Mah is a former broadcast journalist turned communications specialist who has experienced racism towards Edmonton's Asian community, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDMONTON<|>GEO<|>Edmonton is a city in Canada where incidents of racism against the Asian community have been reported, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA SPA<|>EVENT<|>The mass shooting at an Atlanta spa on March 16 resulted in the deaths of six Asian American women, highlighting the issue of racism in North America.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WONG'S BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wong's Benevolent Association is an organization in Edmonton that hosted an anti-hate and anti-racism walk.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHURCHILL SQUARE<|>GEO<|>Churchill Square is a location in Edmonton where participants of the anti-hate and anti-racism walk gathered.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE CANADIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL TORONTO CHAPTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chinese Canadian National Council Toronto Chapter is an organization that reported on the number of racist attacks across Canada during the pandemic.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERENA MAH<|>EDMONTON<|>Serena Mah has experienced and spoken out about racism in Edmonton's Asian community during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATLANTA SPA<|>SERENA MAH<|>The mass shooting at the Atlanta spa is a significant event that has impacted the Asian community, which Serena Mah is a part of<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WONG'S BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION<|>CHURCHILL SQUARE<|>Wong's Benevolent Association organized an anti-hate and anti-racism walk that took place at Churchill Square<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE CANADIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL TORONTO CHAPTER<|>EDMONTON<|>The Chinese Canadian National Council Toronto Chapter reported on racist attacks that have occurred in Edmonton and across Canada<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
