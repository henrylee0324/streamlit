Earlier this week, he was driving with his colleague when they pulled over to help someone pick up boxes, but he froze up when they parked the car on the side of the street.\nHe couldn’t leave the car. It’s not that he didn’t want to help. It was the death threats he had received recently that kept him in.\n“I can’t even go out and help a fellow person in the community because I’m afraid that I might get attacked,” said Nguyen, whose restaurant was vandalized and spray-painted with racist slurs after he spoke out against Gov. Greg Abbott’s lifting of a statewide mask mandate. “I’m not stepping out of this car right now.”\nNguyen said that while he was angry over the racist attack on his business, news of a gunman killing eight people — including six women of Asian descent — at three spas in the Atlanta area has added a heightened sense of fear to the already complicated mix of emotions he’s feeling.\n“I’m emotionally tired. I’m angry. I’m frustrated,” he said. “I think a lot of Asian Americans are frustrated that you see these crimes happening, but nothing’s happening. There’s no stop to it, and people are trying to make it that it’s not a hate crime.”\nCherokee County authorities identified the four victims of the shooting at Youngs Asian Massage in Acworth, Georgia, as Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan and Daoyou Feng, according to media reports. The only survivor of the shooting, Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, remains hospitalized with significant injuries. On Thursday, Fulton County officials named the victims from the other two shootings as Soon C. Park, Hyun J. Grant, Suncha Kim and Yong A. Yue.\nThe attacks in Atlanta are the latest in a wave of increasing assaults in the U.S. targeting Asians during the global COVID-19 pandemic. As the virus spread, the anti-Asian hostility climbed. Former President Donald Trump regularly referred to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus.” For over a year now, Asian Texans have battled a heightened sense of fear on top of disproportionate job losses and business closures during the pandemic. A recent Pew Research Center study even found that 58% of Asian Americans say that people more commonly express racist views toward their group since the pandemic began.\nStop AAPI Hate, an organization founded during the pandemic to track incidents of anti-Asian discrimination, received 3,795 reported incidents of racism against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders across the United States between March 19, 2020 and Feb. 28, 2021. Of those attacks, 68% targeted Asian women, according to the group’s most recent report.\nIn Texas, Stop AAPI Hate has tracked 103 anti-Asian racist incidents that have occurred since March 2020, when a native of Myanmar and his two sons were stabbed in a Midland Sam’s Club by a man who believed the father was Chinese and spreading the coronavirus in the store.\nAsian Texans have also reported verbal abuse and being spit at and coughed on, according to the group.\n“Honestly, I don’t feel safe anymore,” said a Chinese American Austin resident who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared that she could be targeted. She said that last month, a white man driving past her stuck out his middle finger at her for no reason.\n“Even when I’m driving inside my car, I cannot take off my mask. I have to put it on,” she said. “I don’t want those things to happen again. I really don’t know if they have a gun, if they’re gonna shoot me any time. I don’t know. I just feel like it’s a trauma.”\nIn Houston, the Police Department released a statement Wednesday announcing a plan to increase patrols in certain neighborhoods and to organize a town hall to address concerns about anti-Asian hate crimes.\nAmy Zhang, a Ph.D student in sociology at the University of Texas at Austin and a researcher for the AAPI COVID-19 Project, said that pandemic-related racism and more cautious tendencies among the Asian population combined to impact the Asian community harder and earlier than other groups.\n“People were experiencing things, especially early on, that were very much this racialization of being Asian as contagion, where just existing in public while Asian was kind of seen as a threat to some people,” said Zhang. (Zhang previously worked for the Texas Tribune as a fellow.)\nThis kind of racialization of a disease can result in material impacts like unemployment increases, rises in depression and anxiety rates and a distrust of other people, according to Kara Takasaki, another UT-Austin Ph.D student and analyst for the AAPI COVID-19 project.\nAmy Mok, the founder of the Asian American Cultural Center in Austin, also added that labeling the virus as Asian will impact the social reality for Asian Americans for many months, and possibly years, to come.\n“There are questions from our children we do not know how to answer, when they ask, ‘Why do they hate us so much? Why do they call it Chinese virus or Kung-flu virus?’” Mok said. “So it is very hard for children. And then they go back to school and they have their friends, young friends, saying ‘Oh, you are the Chinese virus.’”\nAnd with Tuesday’s attack in Atlanta targeting Asian women, the intersection between misogyny and anti-Asian discrimination remains ever-present in Texas and across the country. The labels that people attribute to Asian women perpetuates a culture of hypersexualization, Mok said.\n“Look at how we label Asian women: madame butterfly, mail-order bride,” Mok said. “The exotic, the erotic Asian woman, so we are reduced to be what? Sex objects.”\nA harsh reality and an uncertain path\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MIKE NGUYEN<|>PERSON<|>Mike Nguyen is a resident of San Antonio who has experienced fear and anxiety due to recent death threats and a racist attack on his restaurant.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREG ABBOTT<|>PERSON<|>Greg Abbott is the Governor of Texas who lifted a statewide mask mandate, which contributed to the tensions in the community.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>Atlanta is a city where a gunman killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three spas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNGS ASIAN MASSAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Youngs Asian Massage is one of the locations in Atlanta where a shooting occurred, resulting in multiple fatalities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELAINA ASHLEY YAUN<|>PERSON<|>Delaina Ashley Yaun was one of the victims of the shooting at Youngs Asian Massage in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL ANDRE MICHELS<|>PERSON<|>Paul Andre Michels was one of the victims of the shooting at Youngs Asian Massage in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XIAOJIE TAN<|>PERSON<|>Xiaojie Tan was one of the victims of the shooting at Youngs Asian Massage in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAOYOU FENG<|>PERSON<|>Daoyou Feng was one of the victims of the shooting at Youngs Asian Massage in Atlanta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELCIAS R.
