To recognize the humanity of Hyun Jung Grant, Soon Chung Park, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Suncha Kim, Paul Andre Michels, Yong Ae Yue, Xiaojie Tan, Daoyou Feng and Elcias Hernandez-Ortiz. To recognize the humanity of every Philippine nanny, novelist or firefighter. To recognize every Mexican farmhand, lawyer and actor. To recognize every Black man jogging in Stanley Park, doing stem cell research, or going to university. To recognize that the Indigenous person waiting for proper hospital care is like me. I am them. \nThey are us and we are them. And in recognizing the common humanity we share, we need to stand up and defend it. \nSo if you see someone perpetrating an act of violence, or if you see a racist posting, speak up. Interrupt and intervene. Make it known to the perpetrator and their peers that the rule of law will be upheld. Honour and defend the values of our hard-won democracy, and together we defeat hate.
