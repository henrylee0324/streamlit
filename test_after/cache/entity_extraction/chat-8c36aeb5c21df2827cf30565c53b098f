Racism most of the time rubs more like a rash than a gash.\"\n\"I live in a conservative part of western Massachusetts. All through 2020, houses in the area brandished frightening and violent Trump paraphernalia,\" she adds.\n\"Before mask wearing became widely practised, I feared marking myself as 'foreign' by wearing one. Then I feared being 'exposed' as Asian when not wearing one. So I covered up completely.\n\"Under my hat, behind my sunglasses and mask, who could know who or what I was?\"\nAs then United States President Donald Trump amped up his \"China virus\" rhetoric, Dr Tan and her husband decided to stop walking in the woods with their dog for fear of running into a \"gun-toting Trump supporter\".\n\"When we shared this decision with others, we always felt embarrassed, like we were overreacting,\" she writes.\nAfter the March 16 Atlanta massacre, Asian social media sites were buzzing with alarm.\nOn a Facebook page called Singaporeans in Americas, resident Josephine Lee of Raleigh, North Carolina, muses about using a self-defence alarm she had obtained long ago in Singapore.\n\"Was heart-breaking... reading a 75-year-old Asian woman and an 83-year-old Asian man were attacked... near San Francisco's UN Plaza followed by six Asian women... killed in the Atlanta Spa shootings!\" she writes.\nOne user responds: \"These attacks are unprovoked and without warning.\"\nHe adds: \"Got to be aware of your surroundings. It's sad.\"\nThe stereotype of an Asian American - fuelled by the misleading \"model minority\" trope - is that he is a member of a community that keeps its head down and does not speak up.\n\"Now we're seeing them coming out in the thousands to stand up for their dignity and I think that's awesome to see,\" Ms Lau tells ST.\nShe adds: \"And that's what I feel - this is the moment, we've got to seize this moment to say, let's fight for our dignity, because if we don't fight, nothing's going to change.\n\"Nobody's going to give it to us on a silver plate. We've got to fight for it ourselves.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
