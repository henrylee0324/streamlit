The rocks cracked the windshield of the woman's Tesla and damaged her bumper, the DA's office said in a press release.The woman drove to a nearby park and called authorities.\"I refuse to tolerate hate in Orange County,\" District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement. \"A woman and her child should be able to drive down the street without worrying about being attacked because of the color of their skin.\"Spitzer vowed to prosecute the case and others like it to the fullest extent to send a message: \"There is no room for hate here or anywhere.\"Janke, who told police that \"Koreans in the area were trying to control him,\" according to the release, pleaded not guilty. The Fullerton man faces a maximum sentence of six years in prison.The incident is the latest in a disturbing surge of hate crimes targeting Asian Americans since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly 3,800 incidents were reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a San Francisco-based organization that tracks discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The group said those reported incidents are \"only a fraction\" of the number that actually occur.Recent attacks include an Asian American woman brutally assaulted in the middle of the day outside a luxury apartment building in New York City and an elderly Asian American woman who fought off a man who hit her on a San Francisco street.The incidents have rattled the AAPI community, with some considering leaving areas like San Francisco where there have been a number of unprovoked attacks. The concerns hit a peak last month after eight people were shot and killed at three spas in Georgia. Six of the victims were women of Asian descent, though authorities have not said the shooting was motivated by race.In the aftermath of the attack, demonstrators took to the streets in major cities nationwide, including New York, Washington, Chicago, and San Francisco, to protest the wave of violence.The attacks against Asian Americans haven't just been physical.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ROGER JANKE<|>PERSON<|>Roger Janke is a 28-year-old man charged with a hate crime for allegedly throwing rocks at an Asian woman and her son in Fullerton, California.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Orange County District Attorney's office is responsible for prosecuting criminal cases, including the hate crime charges against Roger Janke.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FULLERTON<|>GEO<|>Fullerton is a city in California where the incident involving Roger Janke took place, located about 25 miles southeast of Los Angeles.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles is a major city in California, near where the hate crime incident occurred.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>EVENT<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a surge in hate crimes targeting Asian Americans, leading to increased incidents of discrimination and violence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stop AAPI Hate is a San Francisco-based organization that tracks discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is a major city where recent attacks against Asian Americans have occurred, including a brutal assault on an Asian American woman.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California that has seen a number of unprovoked attacks against Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is the state where eight people were shot and killed at three spas, with six victims being women of Asian descent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TODD SPITZER<|>PERSON<|>Todd Spitzer is the District Attorney of Orange County who commented on the hate crime incident and vowed to prosecute such cases to the fullest extent.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is another major city where demonstrators protested against the wave of violence targeting Asian Americans.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROGER JANKE<|>ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE<|>Roger Janke is being prosecuted by the Orange County District Attorney's office for his alleged hate crime<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FULLERTON<|>LOS ANGELES<|>Fullerton is located about 25 miles southeast of Los Angeles, where the incident occurred<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>STOP AAPI HATE<|>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans, which Stop AAPI Hate tracks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Both cities have experienced recent attacks against Asian Americans, highlighting a nationwide issue<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGIA<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|>The shooting incident in Georgia is part of the disturbing trend of hate crimes against Asian Americans that surged during the COVID-19 pandemic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TODD SPITZER<|>ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE<|>Todd Spitzer is the District Attorney representing the Orange County District Attorney's office in prosecuting hate crimes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICAGO<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Demonstrators in both cities protested against the violence targeting Asian Americans<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
