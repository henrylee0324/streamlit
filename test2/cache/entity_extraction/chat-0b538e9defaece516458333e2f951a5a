The Asian Pacific Policy and\nPlanning Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action groups also started collecting reports of incidents of hostility against Asians.\nIn less than a week, more than 400 reports surfaced, said the council's executive director, Manjusha Kulkarni.\nBut Chicago police say they have not seen an increase in hate crimes against people of Asian descent.\n\"There is absolutely no place in Chicago for hatred or bigotry of any kind,\" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. \"We strongly urge anyone who may be a victim of\nthreatening or harassing behavior to contact Chicago police, as we will investigate and work with our partners to prosecute these acts.\"\nBusinesses hit hard\nThe last hour before Illinois' statewide stay-at-home order mandating the closure of nonessential stores, the Dongs were in their family-owned bonsai and restaurant supply\nstore Q Ideas at 1134 W. Argyle St.\nLike many shops on the colorful street known as Little Vietnam, Q Ideas had its doors open on Saturday, ready for customers. But they did not come. \"Oh, my God, it's been\nnothing,\" said Ellen Dong, 29.\nDong, who is Chinese and Vietnamese, wonders whether the rhetoric against China has curbed business on Argyle and in Chinatown. \"I'm really concerned that people are going\nto lose their jobs.\"\nThough Chicagoans led efforts to draw customers through a restaurant crawl in Chinatown, business owners saw steep declines the past few months, compounded by the\ngovernor's order to close all restaurants for dining in.\nFor the Dongs, this year has encapsulated the long-standing paradox of being Asian American: of both being invisible, blending in the background, and still being alien in the\neyes of others.\n\"Asian Americans are forgotten until -- and I don't know why -- until there's something to blame,\" Ellen Dong said. \"Then we remember them.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
